#### Course Intro
[Legal Analytics](http://www.legalanalyticscourse.com/) is a course taught by Professors [Daniel Katz](http://www.katz.law.msu.edu/) and [Michael Bommarito](http://bommaritollc.com/) at [Michigan State University College of Law](https://www.law.msu.edu/). This is a second semester offering that builds on [Quantitative Methods for Lawyers](http://computationallegalstudies.com/quantitative-methods-for-lawyers-course/). The goal of the course is to provide law students with the ability to efficiently manage, collect, explore, analyze, and communicate in a world increasingly driven by data and information. This course is a first of its kind and currently the only law school class that teaches machine learning, despite the prevalence of predictive coding in e-discovery. 

#### Skills
The following skills are developed over the course:
- Collecting, cleaning and processing data, electronic or otherwise.
- Preprocessing using tools such as dPlyR
- Exploring and analyzing data to produce knowledge and insights, including:
  * Machine learning, i.e., classification, regression, and clustering
  * Information Visualization
  * Basic Introduction to Natural language Processing
- Planning and managing an analytic inquiry or project.
- Communicating data and knowledge to clients, colleagues, or courts.
- Representative case studies to be completed by students might include:
  * Performing document review and predictive coding
  * Predicting the outcome of disputes or cases
  * Estimating the cost of a matter
  * Selecting optimal local counsel or jurisdiction.
