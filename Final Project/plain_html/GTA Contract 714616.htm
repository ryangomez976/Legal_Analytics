<p>ARTICLE IV:</p>
<p>FAIR SHARE PLAN</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member of the GTA/CTA/NEA, or who has applied for membership, may<br/>sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of unified<br/>membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments in the Association. Pursuant<br/>to such authorization, the District shall deduct one tenth of such dues from the regular<br/>salary check of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit<br/>members who sign such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall<br/>be appropriately pro-rated to complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the GTA/CTA/NEA, or who does not<br/>make application for membership within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this<br/>Agreement, or within (30) days from the date of commencement of assigned duties,<br/>shall become a member of the Association in one lump-sum payment. In the event that<br/>a unit member shall not pay such fee directly to the Association, the District shall<br/>immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in Education Code 45061<br/>and in the same manner as set forth in paragraph 1 of this Article. There shall be no<br/>change to the Association for such mandatory deductions.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations<br/>shall not be required to join or financially support GTA/CTA/NEA, except that such unit<br/>member shall pay, in lieu of service fee, sums equal to such service fee to either a non¬<br/>religious or a non-labor organizational charitable funds exempt from taxation under<br/>section 501 ©) (3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code, approved by the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>4.3.1. Proof of payment and a written statement of objection along with verifiable<br/>evidence of their membership in a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings object to joining or financially supporting employee organizations<br/>pursuant to paragraph 4.3.1 above, shall be made on an annual basis to the<br/>Association as a condition of continued exemption from the provisions of<br/>paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article. Verifications shall be in the form of receipt<br/>and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of payment and to<br/>whom payment in lieu of the service fee has been made. Such proof shall be<br/>presented on or before same date as GTA/CTA/NEA dues are paid each school<br/>year.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to authorization of the<br/>unit member, whether for membership dues or service fee, the District agrees promptly<br/>to remit such funds to the Association, accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit<br/>members for whom such deductions have been made.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill<br/>the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to pay the District all reasonable legal fees and legal<br/>costs incurred in defending against any court action and/or administrative action before<br/>the Public Employment Relations Board challenging the legality of constitutionality of<br/>the agency fee provisions of this Agreement and their implementation. The Association<br/>shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether any such action or<br/>proceeding referred above shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, tried<br/>or appealed.</p>
<p>ARTICLE V: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROCEDURES</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy: It shall be the policy of this District to practice effective means of<br/>reaching solutions to employee problems arising out of the specific provisions of this<br/>Agreement as close to the source of the origin of the problem as possible and to reduce<br/>areas of grievance.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose: The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to problems which may arise from the<br/>application and interpretation of the specific provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>certificated employee of the District bound by this Agreement to discuss the<br/>matter informally with any appropriate member of the Administration and to have<br/>the grievance adjusted without intervention by the Association. It is, however,<br/>understood that such adjustment may not be inconsistent with the terms of this<br/>Agreement and that the district shall not agree, in accordance with Government<br/>Code Section 3543, to a resolution of the grievance until the Association has<br/>received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution, and the<br/>Association has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions: A grievance is a claim by an aggrieved person that there has been<br/>a violation, misapplication or misinterpretation of any of the provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggrieved Person: is a person or persons alleging a claimed violation,<br/>misapplication or misinterpretation of any of the expressed provisions of this<br/>Agreement which directly and adversely affect the grievant.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day: During the regular school year (excluding summer), a day shall be<br/>defined as a work day for the unit members excluding Saturdays, Sundays and<br/>holidays. During summer (between the last day of the regular teacher work year<br/>and the first day of the following teacher work year), a “day” shall be defined as<br/>any day in which the central administration of the District is open for business.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>5.4 Time for Assertion of Grievance: Any grievance not asserted within the time<br/>periods specified in this Article shall be deemed waived unless extended or shortened<br/>by mutual agreement, in writing, by the aggrieved person and the District. A grievance<br/>may be placed in abeyance and the time-lines stated in this article may be extended by<br/>mutual agreement, in writing, between the aggrieved person and the District.</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: Within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the act or in the<br/>exercise of due diligence or knowledge of the act or omission, which gives rise<br/>to the grievance, the aggrieved person will bring the matter to the attention of the<br/>appropriate principal or immediate supervisor with the objective of resolving the<br/>matter. During the discussion of the grievance, the appropriate principal or<br/>immediate supervisor may, at his or her discretion, request that the grievance be<br/>reduced to writing and the appropriate principal or immediate supervisor will<br/>likewise thereafter respond to the aggrieved person in writing within ten (10) days<br/>after the receipt of said written grievance. The District shall not be required to<br/>notify the Association of the resolution of any grievance at Level One pursuant to<br/>Government Code Section 3543.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: Within ten (10) days after the disposition of grievance, as<br/>provided in Level One above, and, if the aggrieved person is not satisfied with<br/>the disposition of the grievance at Level One, or if there is not a disposition of the<br/>grievance within the time specified under Level One, the aggrieved person<br/>shall, on a form provided by the District, file in writing a clear concise statement<br/>of the grievance, the circumstances involved, the provision or provisions of this<br/>Agreement alleged to be violated, the specific remedy sought, and the decision<br/>rendered at Level One. The aggrieved person shall file the above form with the<br/>Superintendent and the President of the Association. The failure to file the<br/>grievance with the Association shall not affect the validity of the grievance<br/>procedure. However, the District shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance,<br/>until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution, and has been given the opportunity to file a response in accordance<br/>with Government Code Section 3543. The Superintendent shall communicate<br/>his/her decision to the aggrieved person and the Association in writing, if<br/>applicable, within ten (10) days after receiving the written grievance. The<br/>aggrieved person may request a personal conference with the Superintendent<br/>within the above time limits. Should the Superintendent fail to respond within ten<br/>(10) days after receiving the written grievance, the aggrieved person has ten (10)<br/>days from the expiration of said ten (10) day period to appeal in writing as<br/>provided by the procedures delineated in Level Three.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision,<br/>given at Level One and/or Level Two, or if there is no decision within the<br/>applicable time periods, at Level Two, he/she may, within ten (10) days appeal<br/>the decision in writing to the Board of Trustees. Said written appeal shall be<br/>submitted on a form provided by the District. The Board of Trustees shall</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>consider the appeal at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees. If<br/>the Board of Trustees is unable to reach a final determination on the record, it<br/>may reopen the record for the taking of additional evidence. The aggrieved<br/>person shall be given notice of all such meetings and shall have the opportunity<br/>to be present and shall be allowed to make comment on the report and answer<br/>questions raised by the Board of Trustees. The decision of the board shall be<br/>communicated to the aggrieved person in writing within ten (10) days of the<br/>Board meeting at which the appeal was adjudicated. The decision of the Board<br/>of Trustees shall be binding upon the District and the aggrieved person, subject<br/>only to such further rights and remedies as the aggrieved person may otherwise<br/>have by law.</p>
<p>5.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the grievance procedures will be kept as informal<br/>and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure, and in this<br/>regard, either the aggrieved person or the District may elect to have the Level<br/>Three appeal heard by the Board of Trustees in a personnel session to the extent<br/>that such a personnel session would be lawful.</p>
<p>5.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing<br/>of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the<br/>personnel file of any of the participants. Said file pertaining to the grievance may<br/>be viewed by the grievant. Information contained within the said file shall not be<br/>released to any party outside the district without the aggrieved person’s written<br/>consent.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>6.1 Teachers shall be responsible for instruction and other assigned duties for a<br/>period of seven (7) hours and twenty (20) minutes per day inclusive of a thirty (30)<br/>minute lunch period. Teachers shall be present at the school site from 8:00 to 3:20<br/>each work day, which constitutes a work day of seven (7) hours and twenty (20)<br/>minutes, inclusive of weekly meetings, after school duties and other activities provided<br/>for in this agreement.</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals at the K-5 schools will make every effort to limit site-level<br/>meetings such as faculty, grade-level and curriculum meetings, to two (2)<br/>meetings a week. Grade-level meetings will be scheduled for each week; the<br/>duration of these meetings will be determined by the teachers at each grade<br/>level.</p>
<p>6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings at the Middle School will be held on a bi-monthly basis and will<br/>be confined to one hour in length. The principal may extend the meetings past<br/>one hour when circumstances calling for the necessary discussion of school<br/>issues warrant the extension. If meetings extend beyond one hour in length,<br/>teachers may leave the meeting at their own discretion.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, full-time teachers are expected to devote time and participate in<br/>parent conferences (including I.E.P’s, T. E. A.’s, and 504 meetings), curriculum<br/>meetings, School Site Council, Open House, Back-to-School Night and chaperoning. In<br/>making the decision as to the type, time and assignment of these activities, the principal<br/>or his/her designee must consider other commitments the employee may have. The<br/>Association shall actively encourage unit members to participate in the activities listed in<br/>this section.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the school term for members of the unit shall be one hundred and<br/>eighty-four (184) days.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last workday in June, teachers may leave immediately after completing<br/>required District check-out procedures.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall be entitled to a thirty (30) minute duty free lunch period<br/>every day.</p>
<p>6.5.1 The site administrator, or his/her designee, shall determine the scheduling<br/>of the thirty (30) minute duty free lunch.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will schedule five (5) minimum school days per year. Three (3) days<br/>will be for report card preparation. One day will be the last day of school. One day will<br/>be for staff development.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of parent conferencing, the District will schedule five (5)<br/>consecutive minimum school days in the first trimester and two (2) consecutive<br/>minimum school days in the third trimester.</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the first day of student attendance of each school year, the principal at<br/>each site will meet with their staff to determine the best means to implement the amount<br/>of preparation time to be included during the teaching minutes each week. The<br/>principal at Toro Park School and the building representative for GTA will develop a<br/>procedure for providing preparation time for teachers when either of the people who<br/>normally provide preparation time for teachers is absent from school. The procedure<br/>will insure that, barring unforeseen emergencies, teachers receive their regularly-<br/>scheduled preparation time on those days they are scheduled to receive it.</p>
<p>K - 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week</p>
<p>3rd Grade &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week</p>
<p>4th - 5th Grade &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;190 minutes per week</p>
<p>6th - 8th Grade &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;period per day</p>
<p>The preparation period shall not in any way detract from or lessen the quality of the<br/>basic curriculum provided for the students; however, any change in the program that<br/>reduces the preparation period will not be implemented until negotiated by the parties.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the school year, principals and their staffs will discuss staff development<br/>needs at their site. One teacher representative from each school site will serve on and<br/>give input to the district’s Strategic Planning Committee regarding their site’s training<br/>needs. The Strategic Planning Committee will determine training needs based on this<br/>input at its annual spring meeting and will include them as objectives in the district’s<br/>Strategic Plan. These objectives will be used as the basis for staff development training<br/>for the ensuing school year.</p>
<p>6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall conferences for Grades 4-8 shall be scheduled the week of parent-teacher<br/>conferences. If there are extenuating circumstances, the teacher will notify the principal<br/>that he/she has scheduled conferences the week before or after parent-teacher<br/>conferences.</p>
<p>6.10.1 Grades 4-8 teachers may schedule conferences beyond the work day<br/>during fall parent-teacher conference week and submit a form (Form 6.10.1) to<br/>the principal recording the use of in-lieu time during the work hours designated<br/>for such conferences in the same week. If a teacher in grades 4-5 cannot<br/>complete in-lieu time during conference week, it may be done during non-<br/>instructional time during the following two weeks.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROFESSIONAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GROWTH</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional growth activities taken for advancement on the salary schedule<br/>must be approved by the principal and superintendent prior to taking the course, by<br/>completing the “Request for Approval of Professional Growth Credit.” (Form 7.1)</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 10 working days, the principal or superintendent shall notify the<br/>teacher of approval or disapproval on Form 7.1.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for credit to be granted for professional growth on the salary schedule,<br/>the employee must have earned a grade of “C” or above. In a system utilizing “pass” or<br/>“fail”, a “pass” will be acceptable.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Form 7.1 is properly submitted, the following courses will be automatically<br/>approved:</p>
<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courses required as part of an advanced degree program directly related<br/>to present or possible future assignment in the District, or;</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courses required under a credential program to complete a California<br/>credential or other credentials required for employment in any position in<br/>elementary education, or;</p>
<p>7.3.3 courses recommended by the site principal for the improvement of<br/>teaching competency.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers must submit the “Intention to Change Salary Classification” (Form</p>
<p>7.4) to the District Office by May 1, prior to the year of expected advancement on the<br/>salary schedule. Official transcripts/grades or Letter of Verification of Completion must<br/>be submitted to the District Office by September 10 of the school year in which<br/>advancement is requested.</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher will be eligible for professional growth units for classes or workshops<br/>paid for by the district, provided that the teacher pays the credit fees required by the<br/>granting college or university. All forms (Forms 7.1 and 7.4) must be submitted and<br/>approved in accordance with this article.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who attend inservice activities or workshops which occur outside the<br/>school day and which relate directly to the unit member’s present or possible future<br/>teaching assignment may acquire district credits for advancement on the salary<br/>schedule. Unit members may accrue hours of credit for attendance at inservice<br/>activities or workshops approved by their school’s principal and the superintendent prior<br/>to the activity. Approval will be contingent upon appropriate justification of the<br/>inservice/workshop and its relationship to the unit member’s assignment. This section<br/>does not apply to Optional Staff Development Days. All forms (Forms 7.1 and 7.4)<br/>must be submitted and approved in accordance with this article.</p>
<p>7.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulation of 15 hours of inservice or workshop attendance equals one<br/>district unit, which is the equivalent of one semester of district-approved college<br/>credit. District units can be applied to advancement on the salary schedule in the<br/>same fashion as semester units. District units are not transferable outside the<br/>district.</p>
<p>7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who have reached the highest step and column on the salary<br/>schedule may accumulate district credits in the same manner as teachers at<br/>lower points on the schedule, with the exception that teachers at the top of the<br/>schedule may receive credit for inservice or workshop training taken outside the<br/>school day for which the district has paid the registration fee. Each time the<br/>teacher accumulates fifteen district units, the teacher shall receive a one-time<br/>stipend of $1,500.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAGES</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary schedule for the regular certificated members of the unit shall be set<br/>forth in the attached salary schedule which is incorporated in this Agreement.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers required to teach at Outdoor Education School and/or on the Gold<br/>Rush Trip, as they are presently constituted, will receive, in addition to their normal</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>salary for the period of said activities, a stipend of $100 per day for the week in which<br/>the Outdoor Education School and/or the Gold Rush Trip are conducted. Such<br/>teachers will be required to teach, supervise, or be on duty as reasonably designated by<br/>the program at the selected site. This is to include remaining overnight at the site<br/>unless excused by the camp director. The District will consider teacher requests to be<br/>excused from some or all of Outdoor Education School and/or Gold Rush Trip duties<br/>due to extenuating medical and family circumstances.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers required to chaperone on overnight trip(s) shall be paid a stipend of<br/>$75 per day in addition to their normal salary for the trip.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches will be paid for the following:</p>
