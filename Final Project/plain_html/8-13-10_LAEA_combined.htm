<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall fulfill the following requirements:</p>

This proof shall be submitted to<br/>LAEA no later than November 1 of the current school<br/>year.</p>
<p>5. A unit member seeking to invoke the provisions of<br/>Section 5 shall submit an application to the Association<br/>within the time limits set forth in Section 1 upon receipt<br/>of notice of his/her obligation under Section 4.</p>
<p>Failure to make a request for exemption with the time<br/>specified shall be deemed a waiver of the unit<br/>member’s right to invoke Section 5 for that school year.</p>

<p>application, the Association may reject the request if</p>
<p>the Association has reason to doubt the veracity of the</p>
<p>claimed objection. The unit member may, within five</p>

<p>exemption decision of the Association to an arbitrator.</p>

<p>ARTICLE V-HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT AND DUTIES</p>
<p>A. Hours - General</p>
<p>It is agreed that the varying nature of a unit member’s day-<br/>to-day professional responsibilities does not lend itself<br/>to an instructional day of rigidly established length. Unit<br/>members shall be expected to remain at the school site to<br/>work during the hours indicated below, and shall also<br/>remain on site beyond such hours as needed to perform<br/>their additional instructional and professional duties as<br/>indicated in Section “B.”</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For classroom teachers, half-time teachers and<br/>contracted temporary teachers, thirty (30) minutes prior<br/>to the beginning of the students’ normal instructional<br/>day and a reasonable length of time after the close of<br/>the students’ regular school day;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For media teachers, librarians, nurses, speech/language<br/>specialist, resource specialist program teachers, Title I<br/>teachers and music teachers shall be assigned hours<br/>appropriate to the school day;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For learning specialists, eight (8) hours including a<br/>thirty (30) minute lunch break;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all school-based unit members on work days<br/>when students are not scheduled to be present or<br/>shortened or minimum day schedule, the hours<br/>appropriate to the situation as determined by the<br/>principal but not to exceed six and one-half (6-1/2)<br/>hours exclusive of the lunch break.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning days will be defined as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working</p>
<p>independently or in grade level/academic teams to<br/>develop and enrich curriculum.</p>
<p>Classroom planning may include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparing room environment</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathering equipment and materials</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning classroom curriculum, including<br/>articulation with grade level or team</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparing student materials necessary for the<br/>opening of school or new semester</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting up record keeping</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reviewing portfolios/assessments for incoming<br/>students</p>
<p>School-wide planning may include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developing class lists</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establishing school-wide goals</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completing the school plan</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other activities associated with instructional<br/>planning</p>
<p>Planning days may include a staff meeting not to exceed<br/>two (2) hours per day. <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mutual agreement, the foregoing scheduled on-site<br/>hours or work schedules may be adjusted by the District<br/>in individual cases on a regular or occasional basis, so<br/>long as the total weekly number of on-site hours is not<br/>affected.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>7. Teachers are expected to make reasonable effort to<br/>meet with parents during regularly scheduled K-5<br/>parent/teacher fall conferences. Teachers are<br/>expected to make a reasonable effort to meet with<br/>parents during the regularly scheduled K-5<br/>parent/teacher spring conferences if a conference is<br/>requested by the parent or the teacher. The length<br/>of each conference shall be determined by the<br/>teacher. The principal may determine a conference<br/>to be necessary on an individual case-by-case basis.<br/>No unit member shall be required to remain on<br/>campus later than 4 p.m. for the purpose of<br/>conducting these conferences. During all approved<br/>conference times, the site administrator or a<br/>certificated designee will be accessible.</p>
<p>B. Additional Instructional Duties</p>
<p>In addition to these assigned basic teaching and support<br/>duties, unit members shall perform other instructional<br/>duties as necessary. The performance of such other<br/>duties may involve remaining on site beyond the above<br/>specified hours, and may also (depending upon the<br/>nature of the work) involve additional work time away<br/>from the school site. Examples of these other<br/>instructional duties include planning lessons; selecting<br/>and preparing materials for instruction; reviewing and<br/>evaluating work of students; conferring and counseling<br/>with students, parents, staff, and administrators;<br/>keeping records; and attending faculty, departmental,<br/>team, and grade-level meetings.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>Other examples of such instructional duties include<br/>supervising students within and outside the classroom<br/>and class hours; supervising of students’ activities;<br/>cooperating in open house activities; and serving on school<br/>and district committees. In assigning the kinds of duties<br/>referred to in this paragraph, site administrators shall see<br/>that the hours of work involved are reasonable in number,<br/>are equitably distributed among the staff with volunteers<br/>considered prior to mandating an assignment, and that<br/>reasonable advance notice of scheduling is provided.</p>
<p>In assigning any of the above duties and hours,<br/>administrators shall act in a reasonable manner, and not in<br/>an arbitrary, capricious or vindictive manner.</p>
<p>Open House and/or Back-to-School Night activities shall<br/>be held on minimum days. No regular site meetings shall<br/>be scheduled on those days.</p>
<p>The District will make a good faith effort to schedule<br/>individual education plan meetings and team meetings for<br/>fully included students during the normal instructional day.</p>
<p>C. Lunch and Conference Periods<br/>1. Lunch Period</p>
<p>Each full-time member shall receive a daily duty¬<br/>free lunch period of not less than (30) minutes, as<br/>scheduled by the site administrator, except in<br/>emergencies as determined by the principal.</p>
<p>In the event of a local emergency or an emergency</p>
<p>under the provisions of Government Code Section</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>3100, the District will make every reasonable effort<br/>to reschedule lunch utilized during the emergency.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle School/High School Conference/Preparation<br/>Period</p>
<p>Each full-time classroom teacher assigned to the<br/>high school or to the middle school shall be<br/>afforded one (1) scheduled class period daily as a<br/>conference period, except as provided hereinafter.<br/>Conference/ Preparation periods shall be used for<br/>professional job-related work, which will include,<br/>but not be limited to, preparation for classes,<br/>preparation of teaching materials, presentation of<br/>or attendance at demonstration lessons, and<br/>conferences with administrators, other employees,<br/>counselors, students, or parents.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher Load</p>
<p>The District shall make a reasonable effort to avoid</p>
<p>assigning a middle school/high school teacher</p>
<p>classes which involve more than three (3) subject</p>
<p>preparations (a 6<sup>th</sup> grade core is considered two (2)</p>
<p>subject preparations); if it appears necessary to</p>
<p>assign more than two (2), the site administrator or</p>
<p>designee shall consult with the affected teacher and</p>
<p>consider alternative solutions before making the</p>
<p>final decision. High school teachers shall be</p>
<p>assigned no more than five (5) separate classes of</p>
<p>students (i.e., five [5] assigned class periods).</p>
<p>Middle school teachers shall be assigned no more</p>
<p>than six (6) separate classes of students (i.e., six [6]</p>
<p>assigned class periods). Individual unit members</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>shall have consecutive teaching and conference<br/>periods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in<br/>emergency situations, unit members may be<br/>assigned to perform student supervision duties<br/>during their normal duty-free lunch and/or<br/>conference period. The immediate administrator<br/>shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that such<br/>duties are equitably distributed among available unit<br/>members. Also, on rainy days, unit members may<br/>be required to perform student supervision duties<br/>during the lunch period, as long as the unit members<br/>are given a 30-minute duty free lunch. The<br/>scheduled conference period may also, if deemed<br/>necessary by the immediate administrator, be used<br/>for providing replacement services for a temporarily<br/>absent unit member; however, teachers, providing<br/>such replacement service shall be paid at their per<br/>diem rate of pay.</p>
<p>4. Site Committee</p>
<p>Each site will establish a committee whose members<br/>will include any teacher with a “fully included” student<br/>and the site administrator/designee. This committee<br/>shall develop a plan regarding successful integration of<br/>“fully included” students.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Year</p>
<p>Calendars are attached as Appendix “C”.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the School Site</p>
<p>Unit members may leave the school site during lunch</p>
<p>breaks provided that the unit member notifies the</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>appropriate person in the principal/designee’s office. In<br/>addition, a unit member may leave the school site during<br/>his/her conference period on district business provided that<br/>the unit member notifies the appropriate person in the<br/>principal/designee’s office. If, in the case of an individual<br/>unit member, the principal has evidence that the conference<br/>period may not have been used as described in Article V,<br/>Section C, the principal may, at any time, require advance<br/>approval for departure during the conference period.</p>
<p>F. Elementary Planning Time</p>
<p>The District shall provide the equivalent of two and one-<br/>half hours per week of planning time for K-5 teachers<br/>commencing the first teaching day of school and<br/>concluding the last teaching day of the school year.<br/>Schedules shall be rotated annually to ensure equity.</p>
<p>Should planning time hours be lost, due to a single day<br/>holiday or a required school activity, the hours will be<br/>rescheduled within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>Elementary planning time shall be used for professional<br/>job-related work which will include, but not be limited to,<br/>preparing room environment, gathering equipment and<br/>materials, planning classroom curriculum, record keeping,<br/>reviewing portfolios/assessments of students, preparation<br/>for classes, and individual conferences with administrators<br/>and/or support staff in regard to instructional planning.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VI - LEAVES OF ABSENCE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</p>
<p>A. General Provisions</p>
<p>A leave of absence is an authorization for a unit member to<br/>be absent from duty, generally for a specific period of time<br/>and for an approved purpose.</p>
<p>A leave protects the unit member by holding a place for<br/>such member in the District until the leave expires,<br/>usually with the right to return to the District in a position<br/>of the same classification at the conclusion of the leave,<br/>provided that the unit member would have remained in<br/>the position had he/she not gone on leave and provided<br/>that the position had not been eliminated. There is,<br/>however, no assurance that when a leave of absence<br/>necessitates a long-term replacement (a semester or<br/>longer), that the return assignment will be in the school<br/>or administrative site where such unit member was<br/>assigned when the leave was authorized. The District will<br/>make a good faith effort to reassign the unit member to the<br/>site of his/her preference.</p>
<p>If the unit member cannot return to his/her former position,<br/>the procedures of involuntary transfer apply as stated in<br/>Article VIII, Section D.l.(e).</p>
<p>A condition of each leave of absence is that the credential<br/>or permit held at the time the leave was granted, properly<br/>authorizing the services, must be maintained in full force<br/>by the unit member.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>Unit members on a paid leave of absence, unless<br/>otherwise provided herein, shall receive wages, salary<br/>supplement coverage, and retirement credit, the same as</p>
<p>if they were not on leave. Those who go onto an unpaid<br/>leave during any pay period shall receive their salary<br/>supplement (health and welfare) coverage for the<br/>balance of that pay period. Thereafter, they shall be<br/>allowed to remain on continued coverage pursuant to the<br/>terms of the insurance plan selected at their own expense,<br/>provided they make advanced payment of the premium in<br/>a reasonable manner required by the District.</p>
<p>Part-time regular unit members shall be entitled to leaves of<br/>absence to that portion of the leave as the number of hours<br/>per day of scheduled duty relates to the number of hours for<br/>a full-time unit member in a comparable position.</p>
<p>For purposes of this provision, an immediate family<br/>member shall mean father, mother, husband, wife, child,<br/>brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, grandchild,<br/>son-in-law, daughter-in-law, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or<br/>like relationships of husband or wife, or any relative or<br/>close personal friend living in the immediate household of<br/>the unit member.</p>
<p>It is agreed that a unit member who is absent from work</p>
<p>other than for those days as authorized by State law or</p>
<p>authorized leave provisions of this Agreement is taking</p>
<p>an unauthorized absence in breech of contract and in</p>
<p>violation of this Agreement. The District will deduct a</p>
<p>salary amount equal to the ratio of days absent to the days</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>of required annual service for unauthorized absences, and<br/>such members may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Any unit member who is absent from work without leave,<br/>or who fails to return to work as scheduled after the<br/>expiration of an authorized leave of absence, may be<br/>deemed to have abandoned employment and to have<br/>resigned from District employment.</p>
<p>Unit members becoming aware of the need for absence<br/>due to surgery, maternity, or other predictable or<br/>previously scheduled cause shall submit a statement from<br/>their attending physician, or other appropriate<br/>verification of need, as far in advance as possible. The<br/>statement shall include the beginning date of disability or<br/>other cause, the nature of the disability or cause, and the<br/>anticipated date of return to active service.</p>
<p>Unit member who are absent for one-half (1/2) day or less<br/>shall have deducted one-half (1/2) day from accumulated<br/>sick leave; and if the absence exceeds more than one-half<br/>(1/2) day, a full day shall be deducted for each such<br/>occurrence.</p>
<p>B. Return to Service</p>
<p>When a unit member is absent from duty for other than a<br/>specific period of time for a pre-approved purpose, it shall<br/>be the unit member’s responsibility to inform the District as<br/>soon as practicable regarding the date of return to service.</p>
<p>A unit member whose absence under this Article exceeds</p>
<p>five (5) calendar days shall provide, upon request, a</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>statement from a medical doctor or licensed practitioner<br/>stating the reason for the absence. Additionally, it shall be<br/>the prerogative of the District to require verification of<br/>absence of less than five (5) calendar days if the District<br/>has evidence leading to the conclusion that the absence<br/>may not have been used for proper sick leave purposes.<br/>Fees charged by the doctor which are directly related to<br/>providing such verification which are incurred by the unit<br/>member, shall be paid by the District.</p>
<p>A unit member who has experienced a disability absence<br/>requiring surgery, hospitalization, or extended medical<br/>treatment, shall be required to submit, upon request, prior<br/>to return to active duty, a medical statement indicating<br/>an ability to return to his/her position classification<br/>without restrictions or detriment to the unit member’s<br/>physical and emotional well being. Such statement shall<br/>also include the physician’s statement certifying the<br/>actual beginning and ending date of the disability.</p>
<p>In any of the above instances, if the District requires<br/>medical verification by a doctor of its choice, it shall bear<br/>the expense of the same.</p>
<p>A unit member returning from a short-term leave of</p>
<p>absence, such as sick leave, personal necessity leave, or</p>
<p>bereavement leave, must inform the school or site before</p>
<p>the end of the student day preceding the day of intended</p>
<p>return. If the unit member is unable to call or make a</p>
<p>determination before the end of the student day as stated</p>
<p>above, he/she must notify the District substitute desk not</p>
<p>later than 6:00 a.m. of the day of return pursuant to</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>District procedures. The unit member may disregard the<br/>above procedure if he/she has already notified the District<br/>substitute desk of his/her specific date/time of return to<br/>service. A unit member who fails to notify the District of<br/>intention to return to duty before 6:00 a.m. of the day of<br/>intended return shall not be permitted to return to duty and<br/>shall be charged with one additional day of absence,<br/>assuming that the District has hired a substitute for the day.</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>Return to service from an extended unpaid leave shall<br/>coincide with the beginning of a semester unless the<br/>District approves an earlier or later date, and a leave may<br/>be extended in order to make it so coincide. Unit<br/>members on leave for a semester or longer must notify the<br/>Human Resources Office at least forty-five (45)<br/>calendar days preceding expiration of the leave of their<br/>intent to return the ensuing semester. The District shall<br/>notify the unit member of this requirement. If no letter of<br/>intent is filed, a unit member may be deemed to have<br/>abandoned his/her position and may be officially<br/>terminated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</p>
<p>C. Sick Leave - Personal Illness and Injury</p>
<p>1. Entitlement</p>
<p>Full-time unit members shall be entitled to ten (10)<br/>days leave with full pay for each school year for<br/>purposes of personal illness or injury. A unit member<br/>covered by this Agreement working less than full-time<br/>shall be entitled to sick leave in the same ratio that<br/>his/her employment bears to full-time employment.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>If a unit member does not utilize the full amount of<br/>leave authorized, the (10 days) in any school year, the<br/>amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year to<br/>year.</p>
<p>Each unit member shall be notified of the accumulated<br/>leave no later than November of the school year by<br/>means of an appropriate notice from the Human<br/>Resources Office.</p>
<p>2. Compensation</p>
<p>Any unused sick leave credit may be used by the unit<br/>member for sick leave purposes, as defined, without<br/>loss of compensation. A unit member who continues to<br/>be absent under the provisions of this Section shall<br/>receive differential pay or 50% of the unit member’s<br/>salary, whichever is greater. Differential pay is defined<br/>as the cost of the unit member’s salary less the cost of<br/>the replacement. Differential pay runs concurrently<br/>with accumulated sick leave after exhaustion of the ten<br/>(10) days sick leave entitlement for full-time unit<br/>members.

<p>ARTICLE VII - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION<br/>PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance is a claim by one or more unit members of<br/>the Association that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision(s) of this<br/>Agreement which affects the grievant.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant is the unit member(s) or the Association who<br/>files a “grievance.”</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representative is a unit member or Association<br/>designee who may attend meetings at any level with<br/>Grievant.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respondent in all cases shall be the District itself rather<br/>than any individual.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day is a day when the District Office is open for<br/>business.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infonnal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall<br/>make a reasonable attempt to resolve it by means of an<br/>informal conference with his or her immediate<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level<br/>Level I</p>
<p>Within twenty (20) days (defined above) after the<br/>occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the<br/>grievance, the grievant must present such grievance in<br/>writing to the immediate administrator. If neither the<br/>grievant nor the Association has actual or constructive<br/>knowledge of the occurrence of the grievable act or</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>omission, and could not with the exercise of reasonable<br/>diligence have known about it,</p>
<p>Then the twenty (20) day time limit shall begin to run on<br/>the date upon which either the grievant or Association<br/>knew or could with reasonable diligence have known of the<br/>occurrence. The written statement shall be a clear, concise<br/>statement of the grievance, including the specific<br/>provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been violated,<br/>the circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the<br/>informal conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>Either party may request a personal conference with the<br/>other party. The administration shall communicate a<br/>decision to the grievant in writing within ten (10) days after<br/>receiving the grievance and such action will terminate<br/>Level I.</p>
<p>Level II</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at<br/>Level I, the grievant may appeal the decision in writing to<br/>the Superintendent or his/her designee within five (5) days<br/>after the termination of Level I.</p>
<p>This statement shall include a copy of the original<br/>grievance, the decision rendered at Level I, and a clear,<br/>concise statement of the reasons for the appeal. Either the<br/>grievant or the Superintendent or designee may request a<br/>personal conference.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>

<p>D. Arbitration</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II,<br/>he/she may request the Association to submit the grievance<br/>to arbitration. If the Association concurs with the<br/>grievant’s request, it must give written notice to the District<br/>of its desire to arbitrate the grievance within fifteen (15)<br/>days after the termination of Level II. It is expressly<br/>understood that the only matters which are subject to<br/>arbitration are grievances as defined above which were<br/>processed and handled in accordance with the limitations<br/>and procedures of this Article.</p>
<p>Processing and discussing the merits of an alleged<br/>grievance by the District shall not constitute a waiver by<br/>the District of a defense that the dispute is not grievable.</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted using the procedures of<br/>the American Arbitration Association including the<br/>selection of the arbitrator. As soon as possible after the<br/>District receives the written notice of the Association’s<br/>desire to arbitrate, the parties shall attempt to agree upon an<br/>arbitrator based upon a list of 13 arbitrators.</p>
<p>Motions to Dismiss</p>
<p>If the District contends that a grievance should be</p>
<p>dismissed because, for example, it falls outside the scope of</p>
<p>the procedure, or was filed or processed in an untimely</p>
<p>or that the dispute has become moot, such a<br/>46</p>

The District may also, at its option, and<br/>without prejudice, have such a contention heard along with<br/>the merits of the case. If the District should choose to<br/>refuse to arbitrate a dispute, nothing in this Section shall<br/>preclude the Association from seeking, through appropriate<br/>administrative or judicial proceedings, to compel the<br/>District to proceed to arbitration.</p>
<p>Limitations Upon Arbitrator</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change,<br/>add to, or subtract from any of the terms of this Agreement,<br/>but shall determine only whether or not there has been a<br/>violation of this Agreement in the respect alleged in the<br/>grievance. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based<br/>solely upon the evidence and arguments presented to<br/>him/her by the respective parties in the presence of each<br/>other, and upon arguments presented in briefs.</p>
<p>This Agreement constitutes a contract between the parties</p>
<p>which shall be interpreted and applied by the parties under</p>
<p>the laws of the State of California. The function and</p>
<p>purpose of the arbitrator is to determine disputed</p>
<p>interpretation of terms actually found in the Agreement, or</p>
<p>to determine disputed facts upon which the application of</p>
<p>the Agreement depends. The arbitrator shall therefore not</p>
<p>have authority, nor shall he/she consider it his/her function</p>
<p>to decide any issue not submitted or to so interpret or apply</p>
<p>the Agreement as to change that can fairly be said to have</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>been the intent of the parties as determined by generally<br/>accepted rules of contract construction. Past practice of<br/>the parties in interpreting or applying terms of the<br/>Agreement may be relevant evidence, but shall not be used<br/>so as to justify, or result in, what is in effect a modification<br/>(whether by addition or detraction) of the written terms of<br/>this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not render any<br/>decision or award, or fail to render any decision or award,<br/>merely because in his/her opinion such decision or award is<br/>fair or equitable.</p>
<p>No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive<br/>beyond the beginning of the third school year prior to the<br/>last payroll period prior to the twenty (20) day period<br/>specified in Level I of the Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>The arbitrator may hear and determine only one grievance<br/>at a time unless the District expressly agrees otherwise.<br/>However, both parties will in good faith endeavor to handle<br/>in an expeditious and convenient manner cases that involve<br/>the same or similar facts and issues. The decision of the<br/>arbitrator within the limits herein prescribed shall be<br/>binding on the Association, the District and the grievant.</p>
<p>Expenses</p>
<p>All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared<br/>equally by the parties. Each party shall bear the expenses<br/>of the presentation of its own case.</p>

<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>Failure to Meet Time Limits</p>
<p>If a grievance is not processed by the grievant in<br/>accordance with the time limits set forth in this Article, it<br/>shall not be subject to arbitration and shall be considered<br/>settled on the basis of the decision last made by the District.<br/>If the District fails to respond to the grievance in a timely<br/>manner at any level, the running of its time limit shall be<br/>deemed a denial of the grievance and termination of the<br/>level involved, and the grievant may proceed t the next<br/>step.</p>
<p>Time limits hereunder may be lengthened or shortened<br/>in any particular case only by mutual written agreement.<br/>The parties may also in any particular case mutually agree<br/>in writing to expedite arbitration procedures such as those<br/>of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The<br/>parties will attempt in good faith to adjust time limit<br/>problems which occur above Level I as a result of winter<br/>break, spring break or the summer recess.</p>
<p>Association Representation - Released Time<br/>The grievant shall be entitled, upon request, to<br/>representation by the Association at all grievance meetings.<br/>In situations where the Association has not been invited to<br/>represent the grievant, the District shall not agree to a final<br/>resolution of the grievance until the Association has<br/>received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution and has been given the opportunity to state its<br/>views on the matter.</p>
<p>Grievance meetings normally will be scheduled by the</p>
<p>District so as not to conflict with classroom duties.</p>

<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>However, if the meeting is expected to be of such duration<br/>that it would extend beyond the normal business hours of<br/>the District’s central office, the District shall provide<br/>released time with no loss of pay to the grievant and the<br/>authorized representative of the Association if he/she is a<br/>unit member so that the session can be accommodated<br/>within such business hours. This shall constitute<br/>“reasonable periods of released time” within the meaning<br/>of Government Code 3543.1. (c).</p>
<p>Confidentiality</p>
<p>Upon written request of either party, it is agreed that from<br/>the time a grievance is filed until it is processed through<br/>arbitration, neither the grievant nor the Association nor the<br/>District shall publish or discuss in a public forum either the<br/>grievance or evidence regarding the grievance. Nothing in<br/>this Section prohibits a unit member, the Association or the<br/>District from conducting a confidential investigation with<br/>individuals who are or may be affected by the grievance.</p>
<p>No Reprisal</p>
<p>There shall be no reprisal against a unit member for filing a<br/>grievance or assistant a grievant in the above procedures.</p>
<p>Grievance Files</p>
<p>The District’s records dealing with the filing and<br/>processing of a grievance shall be maintained separately<br/>from the grievant’s personnel file.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VIII - TRANSFER</p>
<p>A. General</p>
<p>The District transfer policy is intended to provide an<br/>orderly and consistent procedure by which certificated<br/>personnel may be most effectively utilized within the<br/>District. Transfer of personnel within the District may<br/>be necessary in such cases as:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enrollment changes</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school closure and opening</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;program reduction</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placement of personnel returning from leave</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructional needs of the District</p>
<p>B. Definitions</p>
<p>Transfer: A transfer is the movement of a unit member<br/>from one work location to another work location. The<br/>transfer may include a change in grade or subject area as<br/>long as the move involves changing worksites.</p>
<p>C. Criteria for Transfer</p>
<p>Once the District has established its instructional needs as<br/>stated in “E.l.a” below, the criteria for making decisions<br/>for transfers shall be the following:</p>
<p>• appropriate credentials</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual qualifications</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;district seniority</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preference of the unit member</p>
<p>D. Voluntary Transfer</p>
<p>1. Any credentialed unit member may request a transfer<br/>within the District for personal or professional reasons,</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>by submitting a request for transfer to a building(s) in<br/>the District to the Assistant Superintendent, Human<br/>Resources.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall cause to be posted in the<br/>District Office and in each building while school is in<br/>session, a notice of every known vacancy. Any<br/>unit member wishing a transfer to one of such<br/>vacancies shall apply, in writing, within ten (10) days<br/>following such notification to indicate the position<br/>desired (in order of preference if more than one (1)<br/>vacancy is applied for). No assignment to fill a contract<br/>position vacancy shall be made until the closing date.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside applicants, prospective interns, and district unit<br/>members shall compete for vacancies. Current unit<br/>members who apply for a vacancy and hold the<br/>appropriate credentials shall be considered for the<br/>vacant position. However, when credentials and<br/>individual qualifications of two or more unit members<br/>are substantially equal, district seniority shall be used as<br/>the deciding factor, Current unit members who apply<br/>for a vacancy will be given the opportunity for an<br/>interview.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members who have applied for a specific<br/>vacancy shall be notified when the vacancy is filled. <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall, upon request of the unit member,</p>
<p>notify that unit member during summer recess or period</p>
<p>of leave of posted openings which may arise during the</p>
<p>summer recess or period of leave. The unit member’s</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>request must be in writing and must include a supply of<br/>stamped, self-addressed envelopes for biweekly<br/>mailings for the summer or period of leave.</p>
<p>6. If a unit member already has a transfer application<br/>on file, it is not necessary to make a further<br/>application in order to be considered for any vacancy<br/>for which the unit member may have applied. Transfer<br/>applications shall be valid for a period of one year from<br/>the date of submission.</p>
<p>E. Involuntary Transfer<br/>1. Enrollment Change</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall determine the number and</p>
<p>types of classes necessary to meet the<br/>instructional needs of the schools. Based on this<br/>determination, the district shall define the<br/>staffing needs of the schools. In matching the<br/>staffing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teaching personnel, the</p>
<p>district may assign certain unit members with<br/>appropriate experience and credentials to specific<br/>classes in order to meet the identified instructional<br/>needs of those classes.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent possible, the administrator will<br/>communicate with the staff the need for transfer due<br/>to declining enrollment.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are insufficient volunteers, the District</p>
<p>shall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determine the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit members to be</p>
<p>involuntarily transferred by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applying the</p>
<p>following criteria in priority order:</p>
<p>(1) Instructional need at the sites as a result of<br/>“1(a)” above</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate credential</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District seniority</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the District has determined staffing<br/>needs as stated in “E. 1. (a)”, in all instances when<br/>credential qualifications are equal, district<br/>seniority shall be the criteria used to break a tie<br/>between two or more unit members.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transferees shall have the right of first<br/>return to the school from which he/she was<br/>transferred for a period of 1 (one) year, based on<br/>permanently vacated positions at the former site,<br/>appropriate credential and seniority as stated in<br/>Section “E. 1 .(c)” above.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Se niority” for purposes of this Section shall mean<br/>length of paid contract service to the District. Unit<br/>members who teach less than a full-time assignment<br/>shall accrue seniority in the proportion his/her<br/>assignment bears to a full-time assignment.</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination of the unit member to be<br/>involuntarily transferred shall not be predicated<br/>upon the performance of an extra service<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>2. School Closure</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members at the school to be closed shall be<br/>provided with a list of all vacancies in the District.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members in the school(s) to be closed shall<br/>be provided with the opportunity of listing their first<br/>three (3) preferences for vacancies which appear on<br/>the list.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>(c) The District shall attempt to place all such unit<br/>members in one (1) of their top three (3) choices. In<br/>cases where more than one (1) unit member has<br/>listed a particular vacancy as his/her first, second, or<br/>third choice, the criteria listed in Section “C” of this<br/>Article shall apply.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Openings</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members shall be provided with a list of all<br/>vacancies at the school to be opened.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member may apply for a voluntary transfer<br/>to any vacancy which the unit member is<br/>credentialed to fill.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall apply the procedures stated in<br/>“E.2 ” to all unit members who are assigned to a<br/>school site whose enrollment is changing due to a<br/>school opening.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credential Authorization</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be transferred when it is<br/>determined that the present assignment is in<br/>violation of the unit member’s credential<br/>authorization.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may not be involuntarily transferred<br/>under the provisions of this Section while there is a<br/>vacant position at the site for which the unit<br/>member is credentialed.</p>
<p>F. Notification of Transfer</p>
<p>To the extent possible, the District agrees:</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimize involuntary transfers during times other<br/>than in the spring of the school year, to be effective at<br/>the commencement of the next school year,</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To notify unit members of transfers no later than June 1<br/>of each year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a unit member is denied a voluntary<br/>transfer or is involuntarily transferred, the unit member<br/>shall be provided in writing, upon request, the reason(s)<br/>for such action.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers</p>
<p>In the case of an involuntary transfer, the District agrees to<br/>seek to identify volunteers prior to the implementation of<br/>an involuntary transfer. In such cases, the criteria outlined<br/>in Section “B” shall apply.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>Elementary unit members shall be granted two (2) working<br/>days, or an equivalent form of support, for classroom<br/>preparation, free of teaching duties, in the event of transfer<br/>or reassignment during the school year.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX - EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General</p>
<p>The District retains sole responsibility for the evaluation<br/>and assessment of performance of each unit member,<br/>subject only to the following provisions of this Article.<br/>Evaluations shall assess unit member performance on the<br/>basis of the factors contained in Education Code Section<br/>44652 and the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession. The evaluator’s judgments and conclusions<br/>shall be substantiated with factual information.<br/>Accordingly, no grievance arising under this Article shall<br/>challenge the substantive objectives, standards, or criteria<br/>determined by the evaluator or District, nor shall it contest<br/>the judgment of the evaluator; any grievances shall be<br/>limited to a claim that the following procedures have been<br/>violated.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Evaluation</p>
<p>All probationary unit members shall be evaluated no less<br/>than twice each school year. Permanent unit members shall<br/>be evaluated no less than every other year except as<br/>provided herein,</p>
<p>A permanent unit member employed by the District as a</p>
<p>certificated employee for at least 10 years may enter into a</p>
<p>written agreement with his/her evaluator to be evaluated at</p>
<p>least every five years, provided that he/she: (1) is highly</p>
<p>qualified as that term is defined by NCLB, if applicable, for</p>
<p>his/her teaching assignment; (2) has as his/her most recent</p>
<p>evaluation an overall rating that meets standards. Either the</p>
<p>employee or the4 evaluator may terminate the agreement at</p>
<p>any time by providing written notice to the other party.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Dates</p>
<p>The initial annual evaluation for probationary unit members<br/>will be completed prior to January 1 and the second part<br/>prior to March 15. Permanent unit member’s evaluations<br/>will be completed no later than 30 calendar days prior to<br/>the last student day of the school year.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator</p>
<p>The evaluator shall be the unit member’s immediate<br/>supervisor, or other management employee who is so<br/>designated by District management. The Principal<br/>shall, in good faith, consider a unit member’s request for a<br/>different evaluator. In the event that a unit member is on<br/>a remediation plan administered by his/her immediate<br/>supervisor, additional management personnel may be<br/>designated to provide additional documentation.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Conference</p>
<p>By November 15<sup>th</sup>, a planning conference(s) shall be<br/>completed between the unit member and his/her supervisor.<br/>It is during this/these conference(s) that the certificated unit<br/>member outlines his/her objectives for the school year to<br/>his/her supervisor. The supervisor, after discussion and a<br/>good faith effort to reach mutual agreement with the unit<br/>member, shall determine the objectives. Individual<br/>objectives must be consistent with the educational and<br/>professional goals, objectives, and standards established by<br/>the District, school and/or program, and the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession. The evaluator and<br/>the unit member shall each have a copy of the final<br/>objectives.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>RTIF1CATED AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying Constraints</p>
<p>In developing objectives, factors which might hinder the<br/>achievement of objectives are listed on the planning form<br/>and identified as constraints. If such constraints cannot be<br/>overcome by planning or reasonable exercise of skill,<br/>consideration should be given to modification of the<br/>proposed objectives or selection of a more feasible<br/>objective.</p>
<p>It is possible that later during the school year certain<br/>support requirements may become unavailable and<br/>consequently affect the achievement of objectives.<br/>Such constraints may be noted and original objectives<br/>modified by the evaluator accordingly. The unit<br/>member shall have the opportunity to list differences he/she<br/>might have regarding the constraints.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations</p>
<p>Each written evaluation shall be preceded by at least</p>
<p>one (1) observation of a minimum of twenty (20)</p>
<p>minutes in length. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within eight (8) working days</p>
<p>following the observation, the observer and the unit</p>
<p>member shall conduct a conference, during which</p>
<p>time they shall review the observation and the content</p>
<p>to be included in the evaluation record as a result of the</p>
<p>observation. In the event that the evaluator does not</p>
<p>conduct the conference within the eight (8) days, the</p>
<p>observation shall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be disregarded, unless both the</p>
<p>evaluator and the unit member agree to use it.</p>
<p>Absence or unavailability of the unit member shall</p>
<p>extend the eight (8) day time period proportionately. The</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>primary purpose of observations shall be to identify<br/>strengths and/or weaknesses of performance and to provide<br/>assistance as needed.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remediation Plan</p>
<p>When the evaluator or immediate supervisor<br/>determines that improvement is required, specific<br/>suggestions must be made in writing, and shall<br/>indicate areas where improvement is needed, specific<br/>suggestions for improvement, additional resources<br/>that will be utilized to assist with improvement,<br/>evaluator’s role in assisting teacher, techniques for<br/>measurement of improvement, and time schedule for<br/>monitoring progress. If there was a reasonable period<br/>of time in which to accomplish such notice and<br/>opportunity for improvement, but the evaluator failed<br/>to do so, the problem shall not be mentioned in the final<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel Files</p>
<p>No negative evaluation of performance shall be predicated<br/>upon information or material of a derogatory or critical<br/>nature which has been entered or filed in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file unless the teacher has first been given written<br/>notice of same and an opportunity to comment. During the<br/>discussion of the complaint, both the complainant and unit<br/>member together with the appropriate administrator shall<br/>be present in an attempt to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>If the unit member receives a final evaluation of</p>
<p>unsatisfactory, and such evaluation is predicated upon</p>
<p>derogatory or critical material which was received from</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>parents or students and placed in the personnel file, the unit<br/>member may utilize the grievance and arbitration<br/>procedures of Article VII, subject to the following: The<br/>grievance shall be limited to a claim that the evaluator<br/>acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner and had no<br/>reasonable basis in fact for relying upon the material in<br/>question.</p>
<p>J. Evaluation by the Public</p>
<p>Evaluation of performance shall not be predicated</p>
<p>upon any material of a derogatory or critical nature</p>
<p>which has been received by the evaluator from others</p>
<p>(such as parents and citizens) unless the member has</p>
<p>first been given notice of same and an opportunity to</p>
<p>review and comment, including the right to enter</p>
<p>written comments into the records. Whenever such a</p>
<p>complaint is made, it shall be reduced to writing and</p>
<p>signed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the complainant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be</p>
<p>furnished a copy within five (5) school days of the</p>
<p>receipt by the supervisor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>complainant refuses to reduce the complaint to writing, it</p>
<p>shall be disregarded and may not in any way be utilized as</p>
<p>part of the evaluation process. Within ten (10) school days</p>
<p>of the receipt of the written complaint by the supervisor,</p>
<p>the supervisor shall hold a conference between the</p>
<p>complainant, the unit member and the supervisor in an</p>
<p>effort to resolve the complaint. In the event the complaint</p>
<p>is not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolved within five&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>conference, a summary of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complaint, the factual</p>
<p>investigation, and the action taken, if any, shall be prepared</p>
<p>by the supervisor and furnished to the unit member. The</p>
<p>unit member shall have five (5) school days to furnish a</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>written response. Both the summary and the written<br/>response may then be entered in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file. Receipt of the summary shall be<br/>acknowledged in writing by the unit member. The unit<br/>member’s acknowledgment signifies only that he/she has<br/>received and read the summary. It does not signify<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Review</p>
<p>No unit member shall be reprimanded, suspended, or given<br/>a disciplinary transfer without reasonable and just cause.</p>
<p>If the employee believes that the evaluation<br/>conclusions have no basis in actual fact, he/she may<br/>utilize Levels I and Levels II of the Grievance<br/>Procedures as a process to review the evaluation, but may<br/>not proceed to arbitration with such a claim.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiver of Rights</p>
<p>While evaluation procedures may in many cases be related<br/>for evidentiary purposes to disciplinary/discharge<br/>proceedings, discipline and discharge procedures may in<br/>appropriate cases be undertaken independently of the<br/>evaluation procedures contained in this Article. This<br/>provision shall not, however, constitute a waiver of any<br/>rights a unit member may have to adequate notice of<br/>performance deficiencies and adequate opportunity to<br/>improve.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Activities/Use of Materials</p>
<p>Evaluation of performance shall not be predicated upon</p>
<p>lawful personal and/or political activities and opinions of</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>unit members so long as such activities and expressions are<br/>in accordance with state law and board policy. In addition,<br/>evaluation of performance shall not be predicated upon unit<br/>members’ lawful use of teaching materials provided that<br/>such materials are consistent with the age and maturity<br/>level of the students in the class and with district approved<br/>curricula, program, and policies of the Board of Education<br/>as promulgated from time to time.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Growth Programs</p>
<p>While the parties encourage participation by unit members<br/>in the various professional growth activities, professional<br/>growth programs, inservices, or workshops held after the<br/>regular working hours shall be voluntary. This does not<br/>include staff or departmental meetings at the school site but<br/>staff meetings which include inservice shall not exceed one<br/>and one-fourth hours unless mutually agreed upon by a<br/>majority of the faculty present at the meeting.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Development Days</p>
<p>Professional Development Days will be limited to inservice<br/>on instructional methods including teaching strategies,<br/>classroom management, and academic content in core<br/>curriculum areas. Inservices should be based on teacher<br/>input as it relates to the school and district plan.</p>
<p>As part of a good staff development program, time should<br/>be allowed for planning for implementation. Whenever<br/>feasible, the last hour of a professional development day<br/>should be used for articulation among colleagues in order<br/>to incorporate strategies presented into their curriculum.</p>

<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>ARTICLE X - SAFETY</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make a reasonable effort to provide<br/>employment and a place of employment which is as safe as<br/>the nature of the employment and assigned duties<br/>reasonable permits. A unit member shall not be required to<br/>perform duties under conditions which pose an immediate<br/>and serious threat of serious bodily harm to the unit<br/>member provided that he or she has exhausted all<br/>reasonable means within his or her discretion to remedy the<br/>condition. In addition, the District will provide appropriate<br/>training for any unit member whose job description<br/>requires him/her to perform medical procedures on<br/>students.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members must notify their immediate supervisor in<br/>writing or in the case of emergency, orally, concerning an<br/>unsafe condition in the District directly affecting the<br/>physical welfare of any student or unit member. Their<br/>immediate supervisor or his/her designee shall investigate<br/>said unsafe conditions as soon as is practicable within five<br/>(5) working days.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any abuse of unit members, assault or battery upon unit<br/>members or any threat of force or violence directed toward<br/>unit members at any time or place which is related to<br/>school activity or school attendance shall be reported by<br/>unit members to their immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall take appropriate action whenever a<br/>unit member, while in attendance at school or related<br/>school function, is physically or verbally attacked by<br/>another person or persons. Such action will include</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>reporting such incidents to the appropriate law enforcement<br/>agencies as provided in the Education Code.</p>
<p>E. A unit member may suspend a student for the day of<br/>suspension and the day following for an act enumerated in<br/>“Causes for Suspension” listed below, and shall refer the<br/>student to the building administrator immediately for<br/>appropriate action. If suspension requires the continued<br/>presence of student at school, there shall be appropriate<br/>supervision as defined in district policies. As soon as<br/>possible, the teacher shall ask the parent to attend a<br/>conference regarding the suspension. Whenever<br/>practicable, a school counselor or psychologist shall attend.</p>
<p>A school administrator shall attend the conference if the<br/>teacher or parent so requests. During the suspension, the<br/>student shall not be returned to the class without the<br/>concurrence of the teacher and principal.</p>
<p>A suspended student shall not be placed in another regular<br/>class during the suspension; however, if assigned to more<br/>than one class per day, the student may not be placed in any<br/>regular class meeting at the same time.</p>
<p>In lieu of suspension, the unit member may refer a student<br/>for an act enumerated in “Causes for Suspension” below to<br/>the principal or designee for consideration of suspension.</p>
<p>Causes for Suspension</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caused, attempted to cause, or threatened to cause<br/>physical injury to another person; or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possessed, sold, or otherwise furnished any firearm,<br/>knife, explosive, or other dangerous object unless, in the</p>

<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>1.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District endeavor to continue providing a high quality<br/>education for the students of the Los Alamitos Unified School District. The<br/>District and the Association have collaborated in designing and implementing a<br/>program of Peer Assistance and Peer Review (henceforth to be referred to as<br/>“PAR”) described in the following articles.</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR program allows exemplary teachers to assist permanent teachers in the<br/>area of: (1) subject matter knowledge and/or (2) teaching methods/instructional<br/>strategies.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of assistance and review depends upon whether the participating<br/>teacher is a volunteer permanent teacher, or a “referred teacher,” e.g., a<br/>permanent teacher who has received an unsatisfactory evaluation in either: (1)<br/>subject matter knowledge, or (2) teaching methods/instructional strategies<br/>(including classroom management), or in both areas. Assistance shall be<br/>provided through consulting teachers as described in Section 5.4 of this Article.<br/>It shall not involve the participation of the consulting teacher in the evaluation<br/>of the unit member required by the Education Code, except that the results of<br/>referred teacher participation in the program shall be attached to the evaluation<br/>and be placed in the personnel file after the referred teacher has been given an<br/>opportunity to attach comments.</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Classroom teacher” or “teacher” shall mean any permanent member of<br/>the bargaining unit covered by certificated evaluation requirements.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Participating teacher” is a permanent classroom teacher member of the<br/>unit who either volunteers or is required by this Article to participate in<br/>the program.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Consulting teacher” is an exemplary teacher meeting the requirements</p>
<p>of this Article, selected by the PAR Panel to provide program<br/>assistance to a participating teacher.</p>
<p>j</p>
<p>2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Referred teacher” is a unit member with permanent status whose most<br/>recent performance evaluation contained an unsatisfactory evaluation in<br/>either subject matter knowledge or teaching methods/instructional<br/>strategies, or both.</p>

<p>ABOUT THE SUMMARY...</p>
<p>Appendix E - Page 3</p>
<p>The percentages shown in the summary reflect the amounts the Plan pays of Eligible Expenses after any<br/>Deductible or Co-Pay has been deducted. The percentages apply to “Usual, Customary and Reasonable”<br/>charges. For Network providers, this means that the percentages apply to the negotiated rates and not<br/>necessarily to the provider’s actual charges or the usual charges of similar providers. See “Usual, Customary<br/>and Reasonable” in the Definitions section for more information.</p>
<p>A “Co-Pay” is an amount the Covered Person must pay and balance of the Eligible Expenses will be paid by the<br/>Plan unless a lesser percentage (%) is shown. Co-Pays are usually paid to the provider at the time of service.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SUMMARY ONLY. SEE THE ELIGIBLE MEDICAL EXPENSES AND MEDICAL<br/>LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS SECTIONS FOR MORE INFORMATION.</p>

<p>Staff Development Days<br/>Memorandum of Understanding</p>
<p>« The District and IAEA support the District’s Statement of Beliefs.</p>
<p>Teachers and Staff</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that students /earn best when surrounded by a highly skilled staff that Is<br/>committed to the growth and development of each student We believe that a staff<br/>knowledgeable In academic content well-trained In effective teaching strategies and the<br/>use of technology<sub>t</sub> and who collaborate professionally with their colleagues, are best<br/>prepared to meet the educational needs of their students.&quot; (The Los Alamitos Unified School<br/>District Statement of Beliefs)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that staffdevelopment days are a major component to achieve these<br/>beliefs.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and IAEA also support teachers as professionals.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on student-free staff development days, teachers may use their absence<br/>rights as stated in the LAEA/District contract (Page 29-32). AH certificated staff<br/>members must report to work on staff development days or notify their<br/>supervisor/principal and call the automated substitute/employee management system<br/>(SEMS) at 594-7573 as soon as possible and before 6:30 a.m. Using absence rights<br/>win not result in a make-up of staff development time.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, due to CDE auditing purposes, attendance win be accounted for on staff .<br/>development days by signing in at the beginning and ending of the day.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that both the District and IAEA have Interest in securing the most funding<br/>possible from California Department of Education. The District and IAEA win adjust<br/>this language to adapt with any California Education funding requirement changes to<br/>secure the maximum funding possible.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These student-free staff development changes wilt take effect in the 20064)9 school<br/>year.</p>
<p>• Additionally, this Memorandum of Understanding will be evaluated annually as to Its<br/>effectiveness, funding and staff development requirement changes. Adjustments in<br/>the language will be made based on this annual evaluation.</p>
