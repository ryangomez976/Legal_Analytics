The Board of Education encourages<br/>flexibility and originality in staffing patterns of individual schools to properly<br/>meet the individual educational needs of the students served. Class sizes may<br/>exceed the maximum stated in the Education Code, for which the District incurs<br/>a financial penalty, for thirty-three (33) in Kindergarten, thirty (30) for 1-3, and<br/>thirty-two (32) for 4-6, only on recommendation of the Superintendent.

In the<br/>event that State funding for K-3 class size reduction is reduced or eliminated, the<br/>District and GSCFR reserve the right to reopen negotiations on K-3 staffing ratios<br/>and K-3 class size.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII - CLASS SIZE Cont.</p>
<p>C. Class Size</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District average for K-3 shall not exceed twenty two point ninety four<br/>(22.94) students per class. The District average for 4-6 shall not exceed<br/>thirty-two (32) students per class. If an individual class exceeds this<br/>maximum number the principal is required to implement one of the<br/>following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer student to another class or site.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide additional aide time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District secondary class size average shall not exceed thirty-three (33)<br/>students. The secondary class size average for physical education and<br/>performing arts classes shall not exceed forty-two (42) students.</p>
<p>If within three (3) weeks of the start of a semester an individual class size<br/>at the secondary level exceeds this average by three (3) students, the<br/>following options shall be considered by the department and<br/>administration and one or more implemented as soon as possible:</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide compensation for excess students at a per diem, per<br/>student rate at the secondary schools. This will be calculated<br/>monthly, and revised monthly, September through June, based<br/>upon the number of students enrolled and in attendance on the last<br/>instructional day of each month with adjustments reflected in a</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>subsequent paycheck. This will be revised in qualifying monthly<br/>increments. Teachers may elect to waive this additional<br/>compensation when exceeding the super max as defined in<br/>contract.</p>
<p>The per idem, per student rate for the secondary schools shall be<br/>calculated as follows: employee's annual salary divided by the<br/>number of work days in the school year divided by one hundred</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII - CLASS SIZE Cont.</p>
<p>seventy-five (175) multiplied by the number of student contacts in<br/>excess of one hundred seventy-five (175).</p>
<p>If an individual class size has not been reduced or mutually agreed upon,<br/>the teacher may appeal to the Superintendent, or his/her designee, who<br/>shall make the final decision on the class size within five (5) days of<br/>his/her receipt of appeal. Exceptions to the above may occur when there is<br/>agreement between the department and administration that some classes<br/>exceed this maximum in order that other classes in that department may<br/>have smaller class sizes or a teacher agrees to exceed the class size<br/>maximum on an individual basis.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a student(s) with special needs is mainstreamed into regular classes and<br/>demands considerable extra teacher time and preparation, the teacher may<br/>request a conference. If a conference is requested, the principal and the special<br/>needs teacher(s) involved with the student(s) shall meet with the classroom<br/>teacher to determine solutions.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In secondary activity classes which have a limited number of work stations, such<br/>as but not limited to, industry and technology education classes, science classes,<br/>art classes, home economics classes and computer classes, class size shall be<br/>determined by mutual agreement between the department and the principal.</p>
<p>The department, or a teacher, in such course may request a conference with<br/>his/her principal if it is believed that the class size adversely impacts upon the<br/>educational program. This conference shall take place within five (5) days of the<br/>request. If mutual agreement cannot be reached on class size the teacher may<br/>appeal to the Superintendent, or his/her designee, who shall make the final<br/>decision on class size within five (5) days of his/her receipt of the appeal.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination Classes</p>
<p>1. Combination classes should be formed only when absolutely necessary or<br/>by staff request.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher input should weigh heavily in determining which students are<br/>placed in combination classes.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grade ratio for combination classes should be close to 50:50. A ratio<br/>should be no more than 40:60 with 60% of the students in the higher grade<br/>level.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII - CLASS SIZE Cont.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit of twenty-five (25) should be considered as the desirable class size<br/>but not the mandated maximum.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When possible, new teachers should not be assigned to combination classes.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration and grade level teachers should negotiate the assignment of<br/>combination classes. Factors to consider include teacher interest,<br/>experience, personal concerns, and teachers on waivers or temporary status.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers assigned to combination classes will be allocated $300.00 for<br/>additional classroom supplies.</p>

<p>Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, requires the employee<br/>to take time off from work for an extended period of time, and taking extended<br/>time off work creates a financial hardship for the employee because he/she has<br/>exhausted all of his/her sick leave, leave provided under the Family and Medical<br/>Leave Act, and other paid time off.</p>
<p>Eligible leave credits may be voluntarily donated to a certificated employee for a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury if all of the following requirements are met:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must be a certificated unit member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee requests that eligible leave credits be donated and provides</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>verification of catastrophic injury or illness as required by the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Committee. Participants shall be required to submit a<br/>doctor's statement indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the<br/>probable length of absence from work.</p>

The District shall pay the participant full pay, and the<br/>credits shall be charged at one-half (1/2) day of sick leave for each day of<br/>service.</p>
