<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3......RECOGNITION</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer recognizes CCEU as the exclusive representative of all classified<br/>personnel (excluding management, supervisory, and confidential employees) in<br/>occupying the job classifications as outlined in Exhibit 1.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Employees&quot; in this Agreement refers to all individuals for whom CCEU serves as<br/>the exclusive representative.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any new classified clerical/technical/custodial positions created by the Employer<br/>will be called to the attention of CCEU and will be tentatively designated as<br/>management, supervisory, confidential or a member of the CCEU unit. CCEU<br/>will have ten (10) working days to respond with its concerns over the designation<br/>of the position. If CCEU disagrees with the Employer, a meeting will be called<br/>between CCEU and the Employer to see if mutual agreement on the designation<br/>can be reached. If mutual agreement is not reached, the Employer and CCEU<br/>will ask for an informal ruling from PERB. If either disagrees with the informal<br/>ruling, they may proceed unilaterally to ask PERB for a formal ruling on the<br/>designation of the position. Such challenge or dispute shall not be subject to the<br/>grievance procedure contained in this agreement.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of representation shall be all matters determined by applicable rule,<br/>regulation, or order issued by the Public Employment Relations Board (hereafter<br/>&quot;PERB&quot;), and court of competent jurisdiction, and those terms and conditions<br/>defined in California Government Code section 3543.2. The Employer may<br/>consult on any matter outside the scope of representation at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>

<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postings: All CCOE Classified (and at the discretion of the Superintendent,<br/>including Management/Confidential) vacancies shall be posted by the employer<br/>for not less than five (5) working days to all CCEU members prior to being<br/>advertised to the public. The posting shall include a brief description of the<br/>position, and educational or other special skills required and/or desired, location<br/>and anticipated hours of the position, salary level, and date of closing of the<br/>applications. A flyer will be provided to each unit member. Any employee in<br/>CCEU may apply for transfer to that position by filing a written notice with the<br/>Personnel Department.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling Vacancies: If there are one or more CCEU applicants for a position, the<br/>Employer shall consider experience, qualifications for the position, good of the<br/>Office, and former evaluations in determining if there is a suitable candidate to<br/>interview and/or receive the position. If there are no suitable candidates, the<br/>position will be advertised to the public.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclassification of CEU Position to Management/Confidential:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCEU</p>
<p>position is to be reclassified as a management or confidential position, and the<br/>CCEU member chooses not to accept the reclassification to<br/>management/confidential, he/she shall be given the opportunity to transfer from<br/>that position within the CCEU unit in which he/she has seniority. If no open<br/>position in the CCEU unit exists, and the affected employee is senior, the<br/>Employer shall use the layoff provisions to provide a position for the affected<br/>employee.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclassification: An employee may request a review of his/her position for<br/>reclassification if the duties performed on a regular basis exceed the job<br/>description in complexity, responsibility, or difficulty An employee who desires<br/>such a review shall submit a written request to his/her immediate supervisor, who<br/>will, together with the Superintendent or designee assess the validity of the<br/>request and respond to the employee. An employee whose position is<br/>reclassified will maintain their same step placement on the appropriate range.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary Period in New Position- A classified employee who is promoted or<br/>transferred to a higher position shall serve a probationary period of one (1) year<br/>in the new position.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary in New Position: All salary adjustments for a classified employee who is<br/>promoted to a higher position shall become effective on the first day of service in<br/>the higher position. A CCEU member who accepts a position in a higher range<br/>shall be placed on the step closest to but not less an increase of five (5) percent<br/>of their current salary.</p>
<p>Employee will not get less than their current salary and will be eligible to receive<br/>a step advancement each July 1st.</p>

Employees<br/>assigned to work less than an eight-hour day or 260 day calendar will be<br/>paid based on a percentage of full time work.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Class Work: If a CCEU member is temporarily assigned to a higher<br/>position for a period exceeding five (5) consecutive days, he/she shall be<br/>compensated as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1 of the range for which he/she is temporarily assigned and in no<br/>case to be less than five (5) percent higher than his/her regular salary.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a new Employee has had previous experience in the area in which he/she has<br/>made application, consideration will be given to placement on the salary<br/>schedule commensurate with experience not to exceed Step 3.

<p>10.4 Pregnancy Disability Leave (“PPL’”)</p>
<p>10.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A female unit member shall qualify for PDL if, in the opinion of her health</p>
<p>care provider, she is disabled by pregnancy.</p>
<p>10.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Disabled by pregnancy” shall mean a temporary disability caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth, and<br/>recovery therefrom and shall be treated as such under any health or</p>
<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection<br/>with employment.</p>
<p>10.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCOE shall provide up to four (4) months of unpaid leave to any<br/>classified unit member whose health care provider certifies that she is<br/>disabled by pregnancy as that term is defined above or by law.</p>
<p>10.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to PDL, an eligible classified unit member is also entitled to<br/>twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid FMLA leave priorto the birth of the<br/>child. [See FMLA article for eligibility]. Although FMLA leave is without<br/>pay, a female unit member on FMLA leave continues to receive the<br/>same level of health and welfare benefits she would receive if she was in<br/>a paid status. FMLA leave shall run concurrently with a classified unit<br/>member’s PDL.</p>
<p>10.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classified unit member who is disabled by pregnancy is also entitled to<br/>use her current and accrued sick leave as well as her five (5) months of<br/>differential leave (hereinafter referred to as “sick leave entitlements”).<br/>CCOE will require that a unit member use her sick leave entitlements<br/>during a PDL. FMLA leave and PDL shall run concurrently with a unit<br/>member’s sick leave entitlement.</p>
<p>10.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employee is expected to inform her supervisor at least thirty (30)<br/>calendar days in advance before any PDL.</p>
<p>10.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the leave of absence, including the date on which the leave<br/>shall commence shall be determined by the Employee and the<br/>Employee's physician with at least thirty (30) calendar days’ notice to her<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>10.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pregnancy disability leave ceases as soon as the Employee's<br/>physician certifies in writing that the Employee is able to perform the<br/>essential functions of her assignment with or without accommodations. If<br/>the Employee is unable to perform the essential functions of her<br/>assignment with or without accommodations at the conclusion of the four</p>
<p>(4) months of PDL, the Employee may use, in addition to any remaining<br/>sick leave or differential leave, CFRA leave, if eligible, or ask for an<br/>unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>10.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon return, the unit member shall be reinstated to the position she held<br/>when the leave began or to a comparable position without decrease in<br/>rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any right or<br/>privilege of employment including salary increments and fringe benefits.</p>
<p>10.4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the PDL, the unit member shall return to employment,<br/>request an appropriate leave of absence, or resign.</p>
<p>10.4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be eligible for movement on the salary schedule, the unit member<br/>must have worked a minimum of 75% of the scheduled workdays of her<br/>assignment during the regular school year.</p>
<p>10.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals employed as replacements or substitutes for unit members<br/>on a pregnancy disability leave of absence shall be classified as a<br/>substitute employee due to the leave status of a regular Employee.</p>
<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>10.5 Child Care Leave (“FMLA and CFRA LEAVE”')</p>
<p>10.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under both state and federal law, an eligible unit member is entitled to<br/>take an unpaid leave of absence following the birth, adoption, or<br/>placement of a child in foster care for childcare and bonding purposes.</p>
<p>[If a female unit member took twelve (12) workweeks of FMLA prior to<br/>the birth of her child, the female unit member is still entitled to another<br/>twelve (12) workweeks of CFRA leave after the birth of the child.]</p>
<p>10.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for CFRA is identical to the requirements for eligibility for FMLA<br/>leave.</p>
<p>10.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written request, CCOE shall provide an eligible unit member a<br/>FMLA/CFRA unpaid leave of absence for up to twelve (12) workweeks<br/>within the first twelve (12) months of the birth, adoption, or foster care<br/>placement of a child. This shall include the child of a registered domestic<br/>partner if the unit member is using CFRA leave. FMLA leave does not<br/>include registered domestic partners.</p>
<p>10.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid FMLA/CFRA leave may be taken<br/>all at once or on an intermittent basis. If a unit member elects to take<br/>FMLA/CFRA leave on an intermittent basis, the unit member must take<br/>FMLA/CFRA leave in minimum increments of one (1) day at a time.</p>
<p>10.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless a female unit member took twelve (12) workweeks of FMLA leave<br/>prior to the birth of the child, the unit member (male or female) is entitled<br/>to the same level of health and welfare benefits, as he or she would have<br/>received if in a paid status during his or her CFRA leave. If the unit<br/>member makes co-payments for health and welfare benefits, the unit<br/>member must continue to make those co-payments during the period of<br/>his or her CFRA leave. If a female unit member took FMLA leave during<br/>her pregnancy, the female unit member is entitled to a second twelve<br/>(12) workweeks of CFRA leave after the birth of the child. [Eligible male<br/>unit members are entitled to only one 12-week period of FMLA/CFRA<br/>leave per twelve month period.] However, the female unit member, in<br/>this case, is not entitled to an additional twelve (12) workweeks of health<br/>and welfare benefits. [Every eligible unit member is entitled to only one<br/>12-week period of leave with paid benefits. Although a female unit<br/>member can take two (2) 12-week periods of unpaid leave because of<br/>pregnancy/child rearing leave, a female unit member can only get one<br/>12-week period with health and welfare benefits.] In this situation, the<br/>unit member would need to continue her health and welfare benefits at<br/>her own expense.</p>
<p>10.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall make every reasonable effort to notify CCOE that<br/>he/she intends to take such leave at least four (4) weeks prior to the<br/>anticipated date on which the leave is to commence.</p>
<p>10.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member, upon return from this leave of absence, shall be<br/>reinstated to the position held when the leave began or to a comparable<br/>position without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional<br/>opportunities.</p>
<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>10.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the Employer may extend a unit member’s unpaid<br/>childcare leave for a maximum of one (1) year beyond the period<br/>covered above.</p>
<p>10.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Employee who seeks an extension of childcare leave shall make<br/>application no later than four (4) weeks preceding the expiration of the<br/>original leave.</p>
<p>10.5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees employed as replacements or substitutes for Employees on<br/>a childcare leaves of absence shall be notified at the time they are hired<br/>that their employment is on a temporary basis due to the childcare leave<br/>status of a regular Employee.</p>
<p>10.5.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee granted non-FMLA/CFRA childcare leave set forth in this<br/>Article may continue to receive all fringe benefits at his/her own expense.</p>
<p>10.5.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCOE may seek reimbursement of all health and welfare benefit costs<br/>provided to a unit member while that unit member is on a FMLA/CFRA<br/>leave if the unit member elects not to return to work after a FMLA/CFRA<br/>leave.</p>
<p>10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal and Civic Duty Leaves</p>
<p>10.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is involuntarily summoned for jury duty or who is<br/>subpoenaed to be present in court to give testimony in court or at a<br/>hearing in connection with the performance of his or her duties as an<br/>Employee of CCOE will be granted civic duty leave, with pay, for such<br/>time as he or she is required by the summons or subpoena.</p>
<p>10.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civic duty leave will not be granted to a unit member required to appear<br/>in court as a defendants for personal traffic or other violations of law or<br/>as a defendant or a witness in connection with other employment or with<br/>matters unrelated to his or her current employment with CCOE.</p>
<p>10.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment received for jury duty shall be turned over to the County<br/>Schools Fund. The unit member receives his or her full salary. Any<br/>mileage reimbursement shall remain with the Employee.</p>
<p>10.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Leave</p>
<p>10.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is a member of a reserve component of the United<br/>States or the California National Guard is entitled, when ordered, to a<br/>temporary military leave not to exceed 180 calendar days as provided for<br/>by Military and Veterans Code section 395.</p>
<p>10.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will receive, during the first thirty (30) calendar days of<br/>such leave, his or her full daily rate of pay compensation in addition to<br/>whatever pay is received from the federal or state government for<br/>training if, at the time of the commencement of such leave, the unit<br/>member has rendered at least twelve (12) months of continuous service<br/>to the County Office of Education.</p>
<p>10.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member on such leave shall maintain the right to be restored to</p>
<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>his/her former position or a comparable position at the same salary the<br/>unit member would have received had he/she not been on military leave<br/>In addition, the Employee shall be entitled, if so desired, to continue all<br/>benefit provisions at his/her own expense during the period of his or her<br/>absence.</p>
<p>10.7.4 CCOE shall comply with all provisions of law pertaining to military leave<br/>during the military absence of any employee.</p>
<p>10.8 Industrial Accident and Illness Leave</p>
<p>10.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member becomes eligible for the benefits provided by this Section<br/>after he or she has been employed by CCOE for twelve (12) continuous<br/>months.</p>
<p>10.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each eligible unit member who qualifies for such leave shall be entitled<br/>to full pay for a period of time not less than sixty (60) working days in any<br/>school year as provided for by Education Code section 45192.</p>
<p>10.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of the Employee's temporary disability indemnity and the<br/>portion of salary due the Employee during such absence shall equal<br/>his/her full salary as provided for by Education Code section 45192.</p>
<p>10.8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the Employee shall endorse to the<br/>Employer the temporary disability indemnity checks received on account<br/>of such industrial accident or illness. The Employer, in turn, shall issue<br/>the Employee appropriate salary warrants for payment of the Employee's<br/>salary and shall deduct normal retirement and other authorized<br/>contributions as provided for by Education Code section 45192.</p>
<p>10.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all available leaves of absence, paid or unpaid, have been<br/>exhausted and if the unit member is not medically able to assume the<br/>duties of his or her position, the person shall, if not placed in another<br/>position, be placed on a reemployment list for a period of 39 months.<br/>When available, during the 39- month period, the unit member shall be<br/>employed in a vacant position in the class of the person's previous<br/>assignment based on the person’s seniority as provided for by Education<br/>Code section 45192.</p>
<p>10.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be deemed to have recovered from an industrial<br/>accident or illness and thereby able to return to work, at such time as the<br/>unit member’s physician verifies that the unit member is capable of<br/>performing the essential functions of his or her assignment with or<br/>without accommodations. At CCOE’s cost, CCOE has the option to<br/>select a physician of its choice to certify that the unit member is capable<br/>of performing the essential functions of his or her assignment with or<br/>without accommodations.</p>
<p>10.8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An industrial accident or illness is defined under the provisions of the<br/>State Workers' Compensation Insurance Law.</p>

<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>immediate supervisor of any accident or illness within twenty-four (24)<br/>hours of such incident.</p>
<p>10.8.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided in this paragraph are in addition to sick leave<br/>benefits. Accordingly, CCOE shall not deduct current or accumulated<br/>sick leave from the sick leave allotment of a unit member who is absent<br/>as the result of an industrial accident or illness until the employee<br/>exhausts the sixty (60) days of Industrial Accident Leave as set forth in<br/>Education Code section 45192 and this Article.</p>

<p>10.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each eligible unit member may take up to twelve (12) workweeks of<br/>leave in a 12-month period. Although FMLA leave is unpaid, CCOE will<br/>continue to make its standard contributions toward health coverage. If<br/>the unit member makes any co-payments toward health coverage, the<br/>unit member must continue to make those co-payments during this<br/>period.</p>
<p>10.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCOE shall run an eligible unit member’s FMLA leave concurrently with<br/>all other paid or unpaid leaves of absence for which the unit member is<br/>eligible.</p>
<p>10.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCOE shall comply with the current state of the law as to what is a<br/>“serious health condition.”</p>
<p>10.9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to take FMLA leave, an eligible unit member must submit a<br/>certification from his or her physician indicating that the unit member or<br/>the unit member’s family member has a serious health condition. If the<br/>unit member’s family member has the serious health condition, the family<br/>member’s physician must indicate that the unit member is needed to<br/>assist the family member who has the serious health condition.</p>
<p>10.9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member must meet the following criteria in order to be eligible for<br/>FMLA leave:</p>
<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>10.9.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has been employed by CCOE for at least<br/>twelve (12) months.</p>
<p>10.9.6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member, who has not met the twelve (12) month<br/>eligibility requirement at the commencement of his or her<br/>leave, can become eligible during his or her leave if he or<br/>she meets all other eligibility requirements once he or she<br/>has been an employee of CCOE for twelve (12) months.</p>
<p>10.9.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has actually worked 1,250 hours in the twelve<br/>(12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of<br/>the leave. (This calculation excludes paid and unpaid time off<br/>such as sick leave and vacation leave.)</p>
<p>10.9.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has not taken twelve (12) workweeks of FMLA<br/>and/or CFRA leave during the twelve (12) month period<br/>immediately preceding the leave of absence. [Except in a case<br/>of a pregnancy leave and child bearing leave for a female unit<br/>member]</p>
<p>10.9.6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Employee who does not meet this eligibility requirement<br/>at the commencement of his or her leave may become<br/>eligible for an additional twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid<br/>leave during his or her leave if he or she subsequently meets<br/>all eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>10.9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a FMLA/CFRA leave, “family member” is defined as the unit<br/>member’s child, parent, or spouse. A spouse is a husband or wife. It<br/>does not include someone with whom the unit member is cohabiting. For<br/>purposes of CFRA leave, a “family member” includes a registered<br/>domestic partner. A parent means a biological parent or a person who<br/>stood in loco parentis to a unit member when the unit member was a<br/>child. Thus, a step-parent or a grandparent who raised or helped raise a<br/>unit member as a child would be considered a parent. A parent does not<br/>include an “in law.”</p>
<p>10.9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is taking an FMLA leave because of his or her own<br/>serious injury is also entitled to use his or her current and accrued sick<br/>leave as well as his or her five (5) months of differential leave<br/>(hereinafter referred to as “sick leave entitlements”). CCOE will require<br/>that a unit member use his or her sick leave entitlements during a FMLA<br/>leave. FMLA leave shall run concurrently with a unit member’s sick<br/>leave entitlement.</p>
<p>10.9.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid FMLA leave may be taken all at<br/>once or on an intermittent basis. If a unit member elects to take FMLA<br/>leave on an intermittent basis, the unit member must take FMLA leave in<br/>minimum increments of one (1) day at a time.</p>
<p>10.9.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CCOE may seek reimbursement of all health and welfare benefit costs<br/>provided to a unit member while that unit member is on a FMLA leave if<br/>the unit member elects not to return to work after a FMLA leave.</p>
<p>10.10 Appearance in Court or Deposition as a Witness</p>
<p>A unit member may use his or her personal necessity leave to appear in court or<br/>at a deposition to provide testimony in a matter not related to the performance of<br/>his or her duties as an employee of CCOE.

<p>11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant is an employee(s) of the Office covered by this Agreement.</p>
<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day means any day on which the Calaveras County Office of<br/>Education is open for business.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 12....LAYOFF, EFFECTS OF LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layoffs shall occur for lack of funds or lack of work. When it becomes necessary<br/>for the Employer to lay-off any classified employee, the Employer shall follow the<br/>layoff procedures set forth in this Article and in the Education Code section. The<br/>Employer shall provide notice as required by Education Code section 45117.<br/>Employer shall provide notice not less than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the<br/>effective date of layoff.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any layoff shall be administered within a classification. Employees who have<br/>had their current position reclassified, shall bring forward hours accrued in that<br/>prior classification to the reclassified position. The order of layoff shall be based<br/>on seniority within that class in which the employee has served. An employee<br/>with the least seniority shall be laid off-off first. Seniority shall be based on the<br/>employee’s first date of paid service as a probationary employee. On November<br/>30, 2007, the parties mutually determined the order of seniority based on hours<br/>in paid status. This order is set forth in Exhibit IV. All employees hired after<br/>November 30, 2007 shall gain seniority based on his or her first date of paid<br/>service as a probationary employee.</p>
<p>12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If CCOE eliminates a position in a classification in which all of the<br/>positions have an equal number of hours, CCOE shall eliminate the<br/>position held by the person with the least seniority.</p>
<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If CCOE eliminates a position in a classification in which each position in<br/>that classification is not the same number of hours, CCOE shall identify<br/>the position or positions it wishes to eliminate in that classification. The<br/>employee in the position eliminated may elect to bump into any other<br/>position within that classification held by a person with less seniority.</p>
<p>This process shall continue until the employee with the least seniority in<br/>that classification is bumped or an employee with greater seniority in that<br/>classification elects to take a layoff in lieu of bumping into another<br/>position within that classification.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee laid-off from his/her present classification may bump into the next<br/>equal or lower class in which the employee has greater seniority. The employee<br/>may continue to bump into such equal or lower classifications to avoid a layoff.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who elects a lay-off in lieu of bumping maintains his/her<br/>reemployment rights under this contract.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two (2) or more employees subject to layoff have equal class seniority, the<br/>determination as to who shall be laid-off will be made by lottery as shall be<br/>determined at or near each employee’s first date of paid service as a<br/>probationary employee. When two employees in the same classification have<br/>the same first date of paid service as probationary employees, the County<br/>Superintendent of Schools or his or her designee, the employees, and a<br/>representative of the employees shall meet to determine, by lottery, each<br/>employee’s seniority order. The results of the lottery conducted on that date<br/>shall apply to each employee as long as there is no voluntary or involuntary<br/>action which constitutes a “break in service” for that employee.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid-off persons are eligible for reemployment in the classification from which<br/>laid-off for a thirty-nine (39) month period and shall be offered reemployment in</p>
<p>CCEU * Articles of Agreement</p>
<p>the reverse order of layoff. Their reemployment shall take precedence over any<br/>new applicants. In addition, they shall have the right to apply for promotional<br/>positions and vacancies within the filing period specified in the Transfers and<br/>Vacancies Article of this contract, and use their seniority therein for a period of<br/>thirty-nine (39) months following layoff. An employee on a reemployment list<br/>shall be notified of promotional and vacancy opportunities.</p>
<p>12.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who take voluntary demotions or voluntary reductions in assigned<br/>time in lieu of layoff, or an involuntary transfer because of a loss of funding or the<br/>elimination of a program, shall be, at the employee’s option, returned to a<br/>position in their former or present classification with increased assigned time as<br/>vacancies become available, for a period of five (5) years and three (3) months,<br/>except that they shall be ranked in accordance with their seniority on a valid<br/>reemployment list.</p>
<p>12.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who was subject to being, or was in fact, laid-off and who is<br/>qualified for and who elected service retirement from the Public Employees’<br/>Retirement System shall be placed on an appropriate reemployment list. The<br/>employer shall notify the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’<br/>Retirement System of the fact that retirement was due to layoff. If he/she is<br/>subsequently subject to reemployment and accepts, in writing the appropriate<br/>vacant position, the Employer shall maintain the vacancy, but may fill it on a<br/>temporary basis until the Board of Administration of Public Employees’<br/>Retirement System has properly processed his/her request for reinstatement<br/>from retirement.</p>
<p>12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employer shall maintain an updated seniority roster, indicating employee’s<br/>hire date seniority within each classification in which the employee has worked<br/>during the employee’s cunent employment by the County Superintendent of<br/>Schools. Such rosters shall be available to CCEU in the event layoff procedures<br/>are invoked.</p>
<p>12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who is laid-off and is subsequently eligible for reemployment shall<br/>be notified in writing by the Employer. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail,<br/>return receipt requested and first class mail to the employee’s last known<br/>address.
