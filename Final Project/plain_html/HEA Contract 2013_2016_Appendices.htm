<p>ARTICLE I<br/>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>The Hueneme Elementary School District, (hereinafter “District”) recognizes the Hueneme<br/>Education Association/California Teachers Association/National Education Association<br/>(hereinafter “Association”) as the exclusive representative of all certificated unit members,<br/>(hereinafter “unit member(s)”) of the District, serving under regular contract, for the purpose of<br/>meeting and negotiating. The parties agree that excluded from such recognition are<br/>management, confidential, and supervisory unit members, as defined in the Education<br/>Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2<br/>DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Day” shall mean any day in which the District Administration Office is open for<br/>business.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“School Day” shall mean any day during which students are required by the District to<br/>attend school.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Work Day” shall mean any day unit members are required to be on duty.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Seniority” shall be defined as a unit member’s length of continuous service to the<br/>District. Continuous service shall not be broken by a paid leave. Continuous service<br/>shall not be broken by an approved unpaid leave. Unit members who are tied in<br/>seniority shall have the tie broken by lot.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3<br/>EMPLOYEE RIGHTS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not treat unit members in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or<br/>discriminatory.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not discriminate against a unit member on the basis of race, color,<br/>creed, age, sex, national origin, political affiliation, physical handicap, or membership in<br/>an employee organization.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member will have ten (10) work days to withdraw a letter of resignation prior to it<br/>being accepted by official action of the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member shall have the same rights as citizens to address the Board. The<br/>procedures are set forth in Board Bylaws 9322 and 9323, Oral Communications to the<br/>Board. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paraprofessionals</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may assign a paid Paraprofessional to a certificated employee. The<br/>unit member shall be involved in the interview and selection process, except in<br/>cases of lateral transfer (i.e., same job, different location). If the teacher involved<br/>has expressed a legal and compelling reason not to place the applicant in the<br/>teacher’s classroom, such reason shall be given due consideration by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may assign or the unit may recruit non-paid volunteer teacher<br/>assistants in accordance with above.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Paraprofessional shall be under the direction of a certificated person.<br/>Instructional decision making, including planning and evaluation of materials and<br/>students, shall be limited to certificated personnel.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member may request and the principal shall convene a meeting of the<br/>unit member, paraprofessional, and principal or coordinator to discuss any issues<br/>relating to the work situation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paraprofessionals shall not be used in place of a unit member, except as<br/>provided by law.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in cases of emergencies, regular classroom teachers shall not have the primary<br/>responsibility for performing necessary and required medical procedures, such as<br/>catheterization, suction, injection, gavage feeding and draining.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in cases of late or mid-year enrollment, the District will provide the regular<br/>classroom teacher with notice in advance of placement in the classroom of any pupil<br/>legally identified as severely handicapped in order to assist in preparation and planning<br/>for the pupil.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of a regular classroom teacher, the District administration will conduct an<br/>analysis of the impact upon class size of the inclusion full time of a pupil legally<br/>identified as severely handicapped. Such analysis will involve instructional workload,<br/>physical space limitations, and overall classroom behavior.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of the agreement, the District will maintain Board Policy 4040 -<br/>Employee Use of Technology that provides unit members with information on<br/>appropriate uses of District-provided technology and Internet access.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4<br/>HOURS</p>
<p>A. The maximum length of the unit member’s work day shall be 7 % hours, including lunch<br/>and breaks.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty-Free Lunch</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a minimum of 45 minutes duty-free lunch period for each unit<br/>member except on rainy days when it may be reduced to a minimum of 30<br/>minutes. On any day that a rainy day schedule has been implemented at a<br/>school site, requiring teachers to shorten lunch and recess schedules, the<br/>teacher will be allowed to leave at the close of the site instructional day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junior high teachers shall annually vote at each site on the following options:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 30-minute lunch, thereby resulting in a total site time of 7 % hours; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 45-minute lunch, thereby resulting in a total site time of 7 % hours.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that administrative discretion is appropriate to accommodate a<br/>Professional Day for teachers. The intent is not to change the 7 % hour site<br/>requirements but to give the teachers and site administrators flexibility to accommodate<br/>a Professional Day on an as needed basis.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall also work beyond this amount for Back-to-School night and Open<br/>House and no more than four (4) faculty meetings a month limited to one (1) hour each.<br/>Other meetings shall be scheduled within the 7 % hours. All faculty meetings shall<br/>begin at the close of the student day.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may be excused without loss of pay or benefits upon close of the student</p>
<p>instructional day when personal necessity matters (such as: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dental, legal</p>
<p>appointments, insurance claims, family emergencies, school, and Association business)<br/>require such attention. It is our intent that this provision shall be uniformly applied by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructional Minutes for School Day</p>
<p>Teacher instructional minutes in a regular work day shall be as follows, adjusted as<br/>necessary to meet minimum annual instructional minutes requirements:</p>
<p>K &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;201 minutes</p>
<p>1-3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;285&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes</p>
<p>4-6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;305&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes</p>
<p>7-8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;280&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade teacher, including special day class teachers at the junior highs,<br/>shall be entitled to one period of preparation time.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of regular weekly early release days is for instructional preparation and<br/>planning, including but not limited to individual and group preparation and planning,<br/>grade level and team meetings.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>I. The District and the Association support after-school programs as an important<br/>component of the overall student instructional program. Unit members who work in<br/>after-school programs retain the professional responsibility to complete their regular<br/>classroom duties, including lesson planning and preparation, student assessment,<br/>communication with parents, and participation in meetings, in particular, weekly staff<br/>meetings and student I.E.P. meetings. However, unit members who work in after¬<br/>school programs are not required to extend their required site time to compensate for<br/>the time worked in the after-school program. The District and the Association<br/>encourage school site principals, staff members and unit members to work<br/>cooperatively and flexibly to support effective unit member participation in after-school<br/>programs.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5<br/>CALENDAR (See Appendix A)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school year shall be as per the attached calendars, which allow for the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180 student attendance days<br/>184 teacher attendance days</p>
<p>*189 new teacher attendance days</p>
<p>*New teacher attendance days (included four (4) mandatory summer training<br/>days compensated at $150/per day beginning with the 1999-2000 calendar year).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Prep Day before school opens</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday and the last day of student<br/>attendance shall end after a 180-minute instructional day (recess not included).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff Development Buy-Back Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding from the State Staff Block Grant that includes Staff Development is<br/>utilized to increase the teacher work year from 181 to 184 days, and the teacher<br/>salary schedules was previously increased by an additional 1.65% contingent<br/>upon continued receipt of state funding for this purpose in future years.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While recognizing that illness and emergency situations will arise occasionally for<br/>staff members, the District and the Association are committed to minimize the<br/>impact of unit member absence on staff development days.</p>
<p>a. In order to realize this commitment, the District will ensure substantial<br/>teacher input through site-based decision making. Annually, the principal<br/>will meet with a representative site teacher leadership group to determine<br/>topics for staff development buy-back days, utilizing site teacher<br/>responses to the District staff development survey.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>3. The parties shall meet to negotiate the 2015-16 instructional calendar and<br/>teacher work year in November 2014, and the 2016-17, 2017-18 instructional<br/>calendars and teacher work years in November 2015.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If schools have to be closed due to the creation of new holidays or federal, state or local<br/>emergencies, the days shall not be made up unless the District falls below the minimum<br/>necessary for state aid and such days are not excused by the state.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEA will have two (2) Association meetings during the school year, time and location to<br/>be determined by the Association president. It is understood that on such days,<br/>teachers will be released at 2:20 p.m. to attend Association meetings, and that<br/>adequate notice will be provided to the superintendent regarding time and place of such<br/>meetings. It is the Administration’s intent to provide whatever coverage is necessary for<br/>HEA chair people when necessary.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective in the 2002-03 calendar, the fall Parent Conference period shall be extended<br/>to two (2) full weeks, beginning on the Monday following the Thanksgiving holiday<br/>weekend, to provide teachers in grades four through six with more time to conduct<br/>parent conferences.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6<br/>TRANSFERS</p>
<p>Transfer refers to the movement of a tenured unit member between schools or between grade<br/>levels within the school. There are two (2) types of transfer: voluntary and involuntary. The<br/>purpose of the outlined transfer procedures is to resolve transfers with the least amount of<br/>involuntary movement.</p>
<p>A. Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Transfer shall include any transfer where a unit member, at their own<br/>discretion has elected to apply to an open position at the school site or within the<br/>District during the designated Transfer Rounds.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer shall include the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position Closure exists when an individual unit member’s position is closed<br/>or redesignated, requiring the involuntary transfer of a unit member to<br/>another position.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Closure exists when a school is closed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignments exist when changes in enrollment or programming may<br/>require the reorganization of the placement of unit members within a school<br/>or the district.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>d. Involuntary Transfer for cause may be initiated under exceptional<br/>circumstances. It is the intent of the District to limit these transfers after<br/>other remedies have failed. The unit member will be notified in writing at<br/>least 15 days prior to the transfer. The notice shall include a statement of<br/>reason for the transfer. The unit member may request a meeting with the<br/>Superintendent to discuss the transfer. Involuntary transfers for cause shall<br/>not be arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. Unit members who have been<br/>involuntarily transferred for cause shall not receive priority in the transfer<br/>process.</p>
<p>3. Transfer Cycle refers to the duration of time from the initial in-school transfers<br/>through the completion of round 2.</p>
<p>B. Procedures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of vacancies shall be posted on the Association bulletin board, included in<br/>the school site bulletin, when possible announced in a faculty meeting, and<br/>forwarded to the Association at the time they are posted.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-school vacancies shall include the grade and/or subject(s), as well as the<br/>deadline for application.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District vacancies, after in-school changes have been made, district vacancies<br/>shall include the position description, location(s), grade/subject(s), and credential<br/>requirement (as applicable).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies after completion of District transfer rounds need not follow posting nor<br/>transfer clause. The position shall be subject to posting and transfer during the<br/>next transfer cycle.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Personnel Office shall assemble all applications received within the<br/>window period and develop a list of teachers who have applied for each opening,<br/>in order of District seniority. The lists shall be distributed to principals and HEA<br/>representatives. Principals shall utilize the appropriate list to contact teachers<br/>regarding the transfer. Transfer selection will</p>
<p>continue to be based upon appropriate credentials and District seniority. Once<br/>contacted by phone and email, teachers must decide whether or not to accept a<br/>transfer opportunity within two (2) school days. The decision to accept or decline<br/>the position is binding. If the opportunity is declined, the principal will contact the<br/>next teacher on the list. The process is repeated until the opening is filled, or all<br/>the teachers on the list have declined the opening.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who apply for, and do not receive a transfer shall be given the reasons<br/>in writing upon request.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer Timeline - See appendix C</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Transfer Procedures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-School Vacancies:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial projected vacancies at each school site shall be posted no later than<br/>the second Monday in March, and closed the last Friday in March.<br/>Teachers may apply for in-school vacancies directly to the principal using<br/>the District Voluntary Transfer Application Form (Appendix B), and shall<br/>have two days from the posting to accept the position. If more than one<br/>unit member applies for the same vacancy, the unit member with the<br/>greatest District seniority shall be granted the position, providing the unit<br/>member possesses the required credential. Principals shall maintain a file<br/>of all in-school vacancy applications.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-school vacancies resulting from reassignments or the District transfer<br/>process in Rounds I and II, shall be posted and announced at the school<br/>site as they occur and granted to the unit member at that site with the<br/>greatest District seniority.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Vacancies:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round one (1) of the District transfer process shall begin on the Monday<br/>prior to spring vacation. Application deadline is the Friday prior to spring<br/>vacation. It is intended that all round one (1) positions be filled and the<br/>round closed on the second Friday following Spring vacation. Round two<br/>(2) shall begin on the second Monday of May. Application deadline is the<br/>following Friday. It is intended that all round two (2) positions be filled and<br/>the round closed on the fourth Friday of May. There will be a one week<br/>period following each round to allow in-school positions to be filled.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms are available from the School Office Manager, the Personnel<br/>Office, and in Appendix B. A teacher may apply for more than one<br/>opening. Teachers shall receive a written verification of receipt of the<br/>application form from the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer Timeline - See appendix C</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer Procedures shall not be arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory in</p>
<p>nature.</p>
<p>1. When an individual teaching position within a school is closed or reassigned,<br/>requiring the involuntary transfer of a unit member to another grade or school,<br/>the District shall solicit volunteers from within said grade level prior to selecting a<br/>unit member for transfer.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal and/or superintendent will make the selection based on the<br/>following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials to perform the required services.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District seniority. The unit member with the least District seniority shall be<br/>selected from within said grade level for involuntary transfer, except when<br/>significant educational or legal factors are present which might preclude a<br/>decision based strictly upon credentials and seniority.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member with 8 years or more seniority who is being involuntarily<br/>transferred under this clause has the right to replace a unit member at that<br/>site with the least District seniority, providing they have the proper<br/>credential.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is involuntarily transferred due to enrollment/staffing changes<br/>shall be exempt from future involuntary transfer resulting from enrollment/staffing<br/>changes for the next two (2) school years.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is to be involuntarily transferred during the school year shall<br/>be given the reasons for the impending transfer in writing at least fifteen (15)<br/>days prior to the transfer taking place. The unit member will be given four (4) of<br/>the fifteen (15) days to prepare. The transfer may take place immediately if<br/>requested by the unit member. During the first school month, ten (10) days<br/>notice shall be given.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority to Return to Site/Similar Position</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 2011-12 school year (including May, June, and July 2011) a<br/>unit member that is involuntarily displaced or redesignated due to a<br/>position closure shall have the right to return to his/her original site and<br/>grade level/subject if that similar position becomes vacant or is created.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It two or more unit member s were involuntarily displaced or redesignated<br/>from the same site and grade level/subject and the similar position is<br/>created/vacated then the similar position will be offered to the unit member<br/>in order of greatest District seniority.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the similar position becomes vacant or created and the unit member<br/>declines to accept the position during the 2011-12 school year, then it<br/>shall be filled with a temporary teacher and the unit member that was<br/>involuntarily displaced or redesignated shall have first priority to<br/>accept/return to that similar position before it is opened and posted as a<br/>site or District wide vacancy.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>d. Once a unit member has exercised this option, they have rescinded their<br/>involuntary transfer rights in Article 6.G.I.C.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Closure: If a particular school is to be closed, the involuntary transfer<br/>procedure will be used for the placement of unit members.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member and class being transferred to another school during the school<br/>year shall be notified five (5) days prior to the transfer taking place. The unit<br/>member will be given two (2) of the five (5) days to prepare.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling of District Vacancies shall occur in the following order providing the individual has<br/>the required credential:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary transfer applicants with at least 15 years District seniority</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfer rights shall receive priority over other voluntary transfer<br/>applicants with less than fifteen (15) years of District seniority. The unit member<br/>must state involuntary transfer status on the most recent District transfer request.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary transfer applicants with less than 15 years District seniority - If two or<br/>more unit members with the appropriate credentials apply for a vacancy, the unit<br/>member with the greatest seniority shall fill the vacancy except under exceptional<br/>circumstances including but not limited to bilingual needs.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside applicants</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfer for cause</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education Teachers: Teachers currently assigned to the special education<br/>program may transfer to a regular classroom position if the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher meets the credential and experience qualifications for the regular<br/>classroom position; and</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has reasonable assurance that the vacancy created by the transfer<br/>can be filled with a qualified, credentialed person. Teachers who have served in<br/>the special education program for at least five (5) years in the District shall not be<br/>required to meet this condition.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination Classes: Changes and reassignments for combination classes must be<br/>within one (1) grade level of the teacher’s current assignment. If there are no<br/>volunteers for a combination class, the assignment shall be given to the teacher with the<br/>appropriate credential who did not teach a combination class the prior year or years.<br/>The intent is to rotate combination classes. If two or more candidates are judged equal,<br/>on the basis of rotation, then District seniority will apply as the tie breaker.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Position Selection Procedures: The District will utilize the following process in<br/>lieu of the Voluntary Transfer Procedures stated in Section C for the filling of<br/>categorically-funded and related special positions listed in Appendix D.</p>
<p>This list will be reviewed regularly by the parties and is subject to automatic annual<br/>reopening of negotiations.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School site positions provide services to one (1) or a maximum of two (2) school<br/>sites. District positions provide services to three (3) or more school sites.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Selection Committee for school site positions shall be comprised of three (3)<br/>permanent unit members and two (2) administrators. The Selection Committee<br/>for District positions shall be comprised of three (3) permanent unit members and<br/>three (3) administrators. The unit members shall be selected by HEA. No more<br/>than two (2) unit members will be from the site(s) served by the special position.</p>

Seniority shall be the overriding factor<br/>when choosing among similar candidates.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member selected to fill a special position may elect to return to the school<br/>and position held prior to the selection at the end of the first or second year of<br/>service in the special position.</p>

After applying the above<br/>criteria to all teachers, if the principal determines that two (2) or more teachers<br/>are equally qualified for the Sheltered Immersion position, the teacher with the<br/>least seniority will be assigned.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifications for a Sheltered Immersion position shall be based on criteria “a”<br/>and “b” above.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher assigned to a Sheltered Immersion position may request a written<br/>statement from the principal explaining how the criteria was applied to determine<br/>the assignment, and the principal shall provide the written statement within five</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stipends shall be computed on a trimester basis but be paid at the conclusion of<br/>the school year. Any unit member who qualifies for a stipend listed above and<br/>who works a complete trimester, as applicable, shall be entitled to the stipend<br/>even if the unit member resigns or goes on leave before the end of the school<br/>year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of this Agreement, financial constraints force the parties to use<br/>residual funds from the class size stipend program as a recurring source of<br/>revenue to fund the new Medicare provisions.

<p>D. To help address work load issues for teachers in grades 4-6, the District will provide<br/>schools with a grant of $200 for each teacher in grades 4-6, to be matched by $200 per<br/>grade 4-6 teacher in school site funds. The purpose of the combined grants is to<br/>provide funds to reduce workload for teachers in grades 4-6. The principal and<br/>teachers in grades 4-6 at each school site shall meet annually to determine the best use<br/>of these funds to reduce workload.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To insure due process and protect the rights of unit members.</p>
<p>General Guidelines</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members shall be evaluated once every two years. Permanent<br/>unit members shall not be evaluated more frequently than every other year<br/>unless their last evaluation was unsatisfactory. An unsatisfactory evaluation shall<br/>result in carryover evaluation the subsequent year, but such evaluation will be<br/>limited to evaluation areas that were rated unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension of the interval used for evaluation of permanent unit members will be<br/>five (5) years if the following conditions exist:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a certificated employee who has been employed with the Hueneme<br/>School District for at least 10 years.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is “Highly Qualified” as defined under ESEA/NCLB.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to October 15 in the school year in which an evaluation is to be conducted,<br/>the evaluator shall conduct a pre-evaluation conference with each unit member<br/>to be evaluated.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation procedure for permanent unit members shall, at the option of the<br/>unit member, be completed prior to February 15. The evaluation procedure for<br/>other permanent unit members made pursuant to this Article shall be completed<br/>and transmitted to the evaluatee sixty (60) calendar days before the last school<br/>day of each school year in which the evaluation takes place.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For temporary and probationary teachers, the first formal observation shall be<br/>completed by October 25. The second formal observation shall be completed by<br/>February 15. The Teacher Evaluation Report will be completed thirty days<br/>before the last day of school. The evaluation of temporary and probationary<br/>teachers must be completed and transmitted to the evaluate 30 days prior to the<br/>close of the school year.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations shall be conducted by the school principal, assistant principal, or in<br/>the case of itinerant members, by the designated District administrator.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations may include a specification of unit member strengths to the extent<br/>that they are known to the evaluator.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written evaluation of the unit member shall be kept in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file. The personnel file shall be available for examination by the unit<br/>member or his Association representative. The content of all personnel files shall<br/>be kept in strictest confidence, and shall be accessed on a need to know basis.</p>
<p>C. Standard Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporarv/Probationarv Teachers: Temporary and probationary teachers shall<br/>be evaluated using the HSD Teacher Evaluation Report (Appendix E-1) The<br/>evaluation of the first year probationary and temporary teachers shall focus on<br/>three (3) standards, Standard 1 (Engaging and Supporting All Students in<br/>Learning), Standard 2 (Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for<br/>Student Learning) and Standard 5 (Assessing Student Learning). The evaluation<br/>of second year probationary and temporary teachers shall focus on Standard 3<br/>(Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning), Standard 4<br/>(Planning Instructional and Designing Learning Experiences for All Students) and<br/>Standard 5 (Assessing Student Learning). In addition, each non-permanent unit<br/>member and his/her evaluator will meet and mutually agree on a plan for<br/>Standard 6 (Plan for Developing as a Professional Educator). The evaluation<br/>form for temporary and probationary teachers is contained in Appendix E-1. A<br/>Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program Consulting Teacher shall be<br/>assigned to every temporary and probationary teacher and shall provide<br/>professional assistance in meeting tenure standards through observation and<br/>conferencing, the teaching of demonstration lessons, etc.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Teachers: Permanent teachers shall be evaluated using the HSD<br/>Teacher Evaluation Report (Appendix E-1) and shall focus on a teacher selected<br/>indicator from two standards upon which evaluation will be based. If the unit<br/>member and his/her evaluator are unable to agree upon two standards then each<br/>party shall select one standard. In addition, each permanent unit member and<br/>his/her evaluator shall also meet and mutually agree on a plan for Standard 6<br/>(Plan for Developing as a Professional Educator). Standard 6 shall not be<br/>evaluated in any formal observations and shall not be included in the final<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Observations and Post Observation Conferences</p>
<p>a. There shall not be more than four (4) observations. If the District wishes<br/>more than four (4) observations, the unit members shall be entitled to the</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>presence of the Association Representative during the observation and<br/>post observation conference.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observations shall be no less than fifteen (15) minutes nor more<br/>than sixty (60) minutes in length.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal classroom observations shall be preceded by at least a 48-hour<br/>notice that the observation is going to occur.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three (3) work days after observation, the evaluator shall schedule<br/>a post observation conference to review the evaluator’s observations with<br/>the unit member.</p>
<p>d. Prior to the formal evaluation summary, all preliminary observation<br/>conferences shall include recommendations, if necessary, as to areas of<br/>improvement in the performance of the evaluatee. In the event the<br/>evaluatee is not performing his/her duties in a satisfactory manner<br/>according to the standards prescribed by the District, the evaluator shall<br/>notify the evaluatee in writing of such fact and describe such<br/>unsatisfactory performance. The District shall thereafter confer with the<br/>evaluatee and shall make concerted efforts to assist the unit member to<br/>correct cited weaknesses, including but not limited to specific<br/>recommendations and adequate release time for the unit member to<br/>observe similar classes in other schools at District expense. If a unit<br/>member’s performance is found unsatisfactory, he/she may receive<br/>necessary demonstrations by the evaluator or PAR Consulting Teacher of<br/>the proper techniques or procedures in question.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator should not base his/her evaluation of a unit member on any<br/>information which has not been subject to verification by the evaluator.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final evaluation shall not contain any statement, materials, or evidence of<br/>which the unit member has not been previously made aware.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of unit members shall not be included or be based upon the<br/>success or lack thereof of the instructional or clerical assistant in the<br/>performance of tasks assigned by the unit member, except as it may relate to<br/>maintaining professional relationships.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation and assessment of unit members’ competence pursuant to this<br/>Article shall not include the use of publishers’ norms established by standardized<br/>tests. This provision shall not prohibit unit members from being evaluated on the<br/>progress of pupils on academic content standards as measured by criterion<br/>referenced assessments and required by Education Code Section 44662. The<br/>District shall apply and implement the evaluation provisions contained herein in<br/>an equitable and reasonable fashion.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written evaluation shall be completed and signed by the evaluator before it is<br/>signed by the unit member.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be allowed to affix to the written evaluation a rebuttal of<br/>any portion of the evaluation he/she feels inaccurate, unfair, or incomplete.</p>
<p>D. Alternative Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent unit member who has received a satisfactory evaluation may<br/>participate in an alternative to the standard evaluation procedure in the next<br/>evaluation cycle. This may be repeated for an additional evaluation cycle upon<br/>agreement of the evaluating principal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative evaluation procedure is structured to provide permanent teachers<br/>with individual growth as a professional through independent activities, in<br/>cooperation with one or more permanent teachers on the alternative evaluation<br/>cycle, and/or with the assistance of a PAR Consulting Teacher. Creativity and<br/>risk taking are encouraged.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alternative Evaluation Form for Permanent Teachers is found in Appendix E-</p>
<p>2. The design for the alternative evaluation activity must be submitted to the<br/>evaluator using the Alternative Evaluation form no later than October 15. The<br/>plan design may include any activity related to the evaluation standards as listed<br/>on the Alternative Evaluation form that will provide professional development to<br/>an individual teacher or group of teachers. Resources (i.e., materials, supplies,<br/>release time) shall be made available to participating teachers and shall be<br/>supported with PAR Program funds. The evaluator must approve the plan design<br/>by November 1. Eligible permanent teachers who do not submit an alternative<br/>evaluation plan design to the evaluator by October 15 shall be evaluated using<br/>standard evaluation procedures.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the alternative evaluation plan is approved, the teacher is responsible for<br/>the completion of the plan. Upon completion of the plan, the teacher must submit<br/>a final assessment of the activity using the alternative evaluation form and submit<br/>the form to the evaluator. The plan and final assessment may be completed at<br/>any time during the school year, but no later than 30 days prior to the last day of<br/>school. If the teacher fails to complete the plan and submit the final assessment<br/>within the timelines specified, the evaluator shall submit the alternative evaluation<br/>form to the Personnel Office noting the project was not completed, and the<br/>teacher shall be carried over for evaluation the following year using the standard<br/>evaluation procedure.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 11<br/>LEAVES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided unit members by Sections 44962 through 44985, 44800, and<br/>44801 of the Education Code are incorporated into this Agreement except as<br/>supplemented in this Article.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused sick leave shall accrue without limit from school year to school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence for pregnancy is treated as any other sick leave. A physician’s<br/>verification is necessary thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expected leave so<br/>that a competent substitute may be provided. Sick leave arising from pregnancy<br/>shall commence at the time the unit member’s physician certifies that she is no<br/>longer physically able to perform her regular duties.</p>

The presumption is that the unit member is physically unable to<br/>teach approximately two (2) calendar weeks before expected delivery; as<br/>determined by the employee’s physician, and six (6) calendar weeks after<br/>expected delivery. If this presumption is insufficient to cover periods of<br/>actual illness, additional sick leave shall be provided if verified by the<br/>physician.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may utilize only sick leave for absence related to childbirth<br/>or may use a combination of sick leave and child rearing leave.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a physician’s certification if a unit member is absent for<br/>five (5) or more consecutive days stating that:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is unable to perform duties and should remain on leave;<br/>or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member was unable to perform duties but now may return to<br/>duty.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His/her sick leave entitlement for the school year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave Donation Program</p>
<p>Permanent unit members who are experiencing long-term or catastrophic illness,<br/>and have exhausted fully paid sick leave may request direct donations of<br/>accumulated, unused sick leave from District permanent, certificated and<br/>classified employees. The eligibility of temporary or probationary unit members<br/>to participate in the program shall be evaluated by the parties on a case-by-case<br/>basis.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members wishing to receive donations of sick leave shall provide the<br/>District with a written request to participate in the program. The request<br/>shall include a description of the illness necessitating the donation, and an<br/>estimate of the time period required for recovery. A verification of the<br/>information in the request from the unit member’s physician shall be<br/>attached. Family members or Association representatives may draft a<br/>request in cases where illness prevents the unit members from completing<br/>a request. Illness associated with normal, uncomplicated pregnancy and<br/>delivery shall not constitute a long-term illness for the purpose of this<br/>program.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall publish and post a request for donation notice at each<br/>District work site, and the request shall be announced at a faculty meeting.<br/>The notice shall specify a window period for receipt of donations of fifteen<br/>(15) work days from the date the notice is published. The notice shall<br/>include the name of the affected unit member and the nature of their<br/>illness only if verbal authorization is received directly from the unit<br/>member. As an alternative to the posted request procedure, a unit<br/>member may notify the District of unit members/employees who have</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>offered to donate sick leave to them, and the District will verify the<br/>information and transfer the sick leave pursuant to program guidelines and<br/>pursuant to program guidelines and restrictions.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may donate a maximum equivalent of five (5) days of sick<br/>leave for the affected unit member. Certificated employees may donate<br/>sick leave to other certificated employees in not less than one-half (0.5)<br/>day increments. Certificated employees may donate sick leave to<br/>classified employees in not less than one-half (0.5) day increments.<br/>Classified employees may donate sick leave to certificated employees in<br/>not less than four (4) hour increments. Certificated employees may not<br/>donate sick leave if, as a result of the donation, their balance of<br/>accumulated sick leave falls below fifteen (15) days. Donations of sick<br/>leave shall be submitted to the District Personnel Office on a form<br/>provided by the District. Unit members may receive up to a maximum of<br/>one hundred (100) days of donated sick leave. The one hundred day limit<br/>may be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Donations shall be<br/>transferred to the leave balance of the unit member requesting the<br/>donation on a day-to-day basis, regardless of the daily salary of the<br/>employees donating and receiving donations. The District shall provide<br/>certificated employees donating leave with a verification of sick leave<br/>hours transferred to the affected unit member. Any donated sick leave not<br/>utilized by the affected unit member at the conclusion of the illness shall<br/>be returned to the sick leave balance of the certificated employees who<br/>provided donations on a prorated basis.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated sick leave shall be treated as regular, accumulated sick leave for<br/>affected unit members pursuant to collective bargaining agreements and<br/>Board Policy governing the use of sick leave, however; it is the intent of<br/>the parties that the sick leave donation program serve as a safety net for<br/>unit members experiencing long-term or catastrophic illness as opposed to<br/>frequent day-to-day absences. Donated days of sick leave shall be<br/>utilized prior to, but not in addition to the use of extended illness provisions<br/>detailed in Article ll-D. Donated sick days may not be used for personal<br/>necessity pursuant to Article ll-F.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may utilize accrued sick leave to attend to the needs of a<br/>child or spouse who is experiencing a serious, potentially terminal illness.<br/>Unit members who wish to utilize sick leave for this purpose must submit a<br/>written request to the Superintendent or designee. The request must<br/>include written verification to the child/spouse’s physical condition from an<br/>attending physician. Unit members who have exhausted all accrued sick<br/>leave may access the sick leave donation program to attend to the needs<br/>of a seriously ill child/spouse.</p>

The request must include written verification<br/>of the child/spouse’s physical condition from an attending physician.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave, including<br/>accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent from duty on account of<br/>illness or accident, whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>employment, the unit member shall receive an additional five (5) months of<br/>extended illness leave.

<p>Every unit member shall be entitled to five (5) days of paid leave of absence on account<br/>of the death of any member of his/her immediate family.

<p>ARTICLE 16<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a claim by a grievant that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation, or misapplication of a provision(s) of this Agreement, which<br/>adversely affects the grievant.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” shall be an individual unit member, a group of unit members, or the<br/>Association when it grieves on behalf of specified individuals or regarding an<br/>Association right provided by this Agreement.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative<br/>level, solutions to the claims which may arise and affect the “Terms of this<br/>Agreement.” Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal<br/>and private as may be appropriate at any level of the procedures.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the<br/>time limits specified at each level should be considered to be maximum and<br/>every effort should be made to expedite the process. Failure by the grievant to<br/>meet any time limits constitutes a waiver of the grievance. Failure by the District<br/>to meet any time limits allows the grievant to proceed to the next step. At any<br/>level of the procedure, the time limits may be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s processing and discussing the merits of an alleged grievance by a<br/>member shall not constitute a waiver by the District of a defense that the dispute<br/>is not grievable.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designed by the Association to<br/>investigate a grievance, attend a grievance meeting/hearing, or serve as a<br/>witness during the day, he/she shall, upon notice to his/her principal, or<br/>immediate supervisor by the president of the Association, be released without<br/>loss of pay as per Article 13, in order to permit participation in the foregoing<br/>activities.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance shall be filed in a separate grievance file and shall not be kept in the<br/>personnel file of any of the participants. This information shall not be transmitted<br/>to future prospective employers and it shall not be considered in future<br/>promotions within the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the Superintendent, any member or<br/>representative of the administration, or any other participant in the grievance<br/>procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>C. Steps in the Grievance Procedures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) work days after the occurrence of the act or omission<br/>giving rise to the grievance, the grievant must present the grievance in<br/>writing on the appropriate District form to his/her immediate supervisor<br/>and the Association. The grievance shall include the date of violation and<br/>the specific section of the Agreement allegedly violated.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the<br/>circumstances involved, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor shall communicate his decision to the unit member in<br/>writing within ten (10) work days after receiving the grievance. If the<br/>supervisor does not respond within the time limits, the grievant, may<br/>appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limits, either party may request a personal<br/>conference and the grievant may appear with an Association<br/>representative.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the decision may<br/>be appealed within ten (10) work days on the appropriate form to the<br/>superintendent or designee and the Association.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall include a copy of the original grievance and appeal,<br/>the decisions rendered, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for<br/>the appeal. Either the grievant or the superintendent may request a<br/>personal conference within the above time limits. The grievant may<br/>appear with an Association representative.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superintendent or designee shall communicate a decision to the<br/>grievant within ten (10) work days. If the superintendent or designee does<br/>not respond within the time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the<br/>next level.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III</p>
<p>a. In the event that the unit member is not satisfied with the recommendation(s)<br/>of the superintendent, the decision may be appealed in writing within ten (10)<br/>work days to the Board of Trustees and a hearing requested. The unit<br/>member may appear at the hearing with an Association representative.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative to the Level III (a), the grievant may request the<br/>Association to submit the grievance to arbitration. If the Association<br/>occurs with the grievant’s request for arbitration, the Association shall,<br/>within ten (10) work days of the conclusion of level II, submit a written<br/>request for arbitration to the superintendent.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District shall attempt to mutually select an<br/>arbitrator. If an arbitrator is not mutually selected within ten (10) work<br/>days, the parties shall request a panel of five (5) arbitrator’s names from<br/>the State Conciliation Service. Parties shall alternately strike names from<br/>the panel. Striking order shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the<br/>District and the Association. All other expenses, including fees and costs<br/>of witnesses and conferees, shall be shared by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the<br/>terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision shall be binding on both parties.</p>

<p>The District and the Association recognize the duty and obligation of their<br/>representatives to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. Therefore, it is agreed<br/>that there will not be a strike or lockout during the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>In the event of a strike, work stoppage, slow down, or other interference with the<br/>operation of the District by any unit member, the Association will take all reasonable<br/>steps to cause those unit members to discontinue such action.</p>
<p>In the event this article is violated by the Association, the Board shall have the right to<br/>withdraw rights and privileges provided for in this Agreement.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 21<br/>DISTRICT RIGHTS</p>
<p>Except as agreed in this contract, it is understood and agreed that the District retains all<br/>of its power and authority to direct, manage, and control to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>The exercise of the foregoing powers, rights, authority, duties, and responsibilities by<br/>the District, the adoption of policies, rules, regulations, and practices in furtherance<br/>thereof, and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith, shall be limited<br/>only by the specific and express terms of this Agreement, and then only to the extent<br/>such specific and express terms are in conformance with law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 22<br/>FULL UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>This Agreement shall supersede any rules, regulations, or practices of the Board of<br/>Trustees which are or may, during its term, be contrary to or inconsistent with its<br/>provisions.</p>
<p>It is intended that this Agreement sets forth the full and entire understanding of the<br/>parties regarding the matters set forth herein, and any other prior or existing<br/>understanding or agreements by the parties, whether formal or informal, regarding any<br/>such matters are hereby superseded or terminated in their entirety.</p>
<p>Except as specifically provided herein, it is agreed and understood that each party<br/>hereto voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives its right, and agrees that the other shall not<br/>be required, to negotiate with respect to any subject or matter covered herein. Except<br/>as provided herein, changes in District policy relating to scope as defined by PERB shall<br/>be by mutual consent of the Association and the District.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any agreement, alteration, understanding, variation, waiver, or modification of any of the<br/>terms or provisions contained herein shall not be binding upon the parties hereto unless<br/>made and executed in writing by all parties hereto, and if required, approved and<br/>implemented by the Board of Trustees and the Association.</p>

<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of the Agreement shall not be interpreted or applied in manner which is<br/>arbitrary or discriminatory. Rules which are designed to implement this Agreement shall<br/>be uniform in application and effect.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 23<br/>JOB SHARING</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition - “Job Sharing” shall refer to two (2) teachers on regular contracts sharing<br/>one (1) teaching assignment. The job share may be other than a 0.50/0.50 FTE split as<br/>long as the two assignments equal 1.0 FTE (i.e., 0.40/0.60 FTE split).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) teachers shall share an assignment for a minimum of one (1) year.</p>
<p>D. Only permanent teachers may apply for a job share assignment. If a permanent unit<br/>member wishes to job share, and is unable to locate another permanent unit member to<br/>share an assignment, the unit member wishing to job share may request the District hire<br/>a temporary teacher to job share with the permanent unit member. Job shares between<br/>permanent and temporary teacher will not be approved for more than two years.<br/>Applications for a job share assignment for the following school year shall be filed with<br/>the District no later than April 1 notwithstanding exceptional circumstances. The<br/>application must state the name of the teacher who currently holds the position to be<br/>shared.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests for job sharing shall be reviewed by the principal and the superintendent or<br/>designee. The superintendent or his designee shall make a recommendation to the<br/>Board.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall approve or deny the request and notify, in writing, the personnel office,<br/>principal, and the applicants of its decision.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, job sharing teachers’ wages,<br/>benefits, and paid leave shall be prorated relative to the actual time worked. In no event<br/>shall the total amount of health and welfare benefits for the job sharers exceed the<br/>amount the District would have paid the position had not been shared.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing teachers shall receive experience credit for salary schedule advancement<br/>prorated based upon the FTE share. Job sharing teachers must accumulate the<br/>equivalent of at least 75% of a single year’s full time experience credit to advance on<br/>the salary schedule. Such credit may be earned over multiple years (i.e., job share<br/>assignment is 0.30 FTE, experience credit for salary schedule advance occurs after<br/>third year in the job share).</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of the two teachers, a job sharing assignment may be renewed provided<br/>the two teachers notify the District in writing prior to April 1. In the event the two<br/>teachers fail to notify the District of their desire to continue the job sharing assignment,<br/>or in the event the District does not approve the continuance of the assignment, the<br/>teachers shall be returned to full-time assignments.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher on a regular contract is in a job-sharing assignment and elects to return after the<br/>first year to full-time teaching, the teacher will be returned to his/her original school/position. If a<br/>teacher on a regular contract is in a job sharing assignment for more than one (1) year and<br/>elects to return to full-time teaching, the teacher will be assigned to the first available full¬<br/>time teaching position for which he/she is certified and competent and in conformance<br/>with Article 6 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide interested applicants with a list of criteria which should be<br/>satisfactorily addressed in the application.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 24<br/>SUMMER SCHOOL</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide unit members with information on summer school employment<br/>opportunities. The information shall include the proposed school calendar, work<br/>schedule, locations, and prorated salary information.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members teaching in the summer school program shall receive their prorated daily<br/>wage rate, based upon the seven (7) hour, fifteen (15) minute (435 minutes) regular<br/>year contract work year. The summer school salary shall be calculated using the<br/>member’s prorated daily wage rate, multiplied by the total number of summer school<br/>work days, which shall include one (1) preparation day.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer school employment shall continue to be contingent upon adequate enrollment.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer school unit members are entitled to one (1) day of summer school sick leave.<br/>The summer school sick leave day may be used for the illness of the unit member or the<br/>unit member’s spouse or child, or for emergency personal necessity as outlined in<br/>Article 11-G-2-a/b. The unit member shall be paid the difference between his/her daily<br/>rate and the cost of the substitute. Additional absences shall result in full summer<br/>school daily rate deductions. Summer school substitutes shall be compensated at the<br/>regular year, full daily substitute rate. Summer school is a limited term instructional</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>program, generally serving at-risk students. Therefore, continuity of instruction is<br/>critical. The parties agree that summer school teacher attendance is a central<br/>component of that continuity. Summer school unit members who do not use the<br/>summer school sick leave day shall have one (1) day of sick leave added to their<br/>regular accrued sick leave balance.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If more than enough applications are received for summer school employment,<br/>preference shall be given to teachers who did not teach the prior year or years. The<br/>intent is to rotate assignments. The district may use the discretion in placing unit<br/>members in summer school positions which require specialized instructional or<br/>leadership skills. If two or more candidates are judged equal on the basis of rotation<br/>and specialized instructional or leadership skills, then District seniority will apply as tie<br/>breaker.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer school teachers will teach a prescribed curriculum using specific instructional<br/>strategies developed by the District.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers employed in the summer school program shall attend summer school training<br/>on the prescribed curriculum and instructional strategies to be utilized in the summer<br/>school program. Unit members shall be compensated for summer school training at<br/>their prorated daily wage rate, paid on a non-contract extra-time basis</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may apply to share a single summer school assignment, provided the<br/>joint application clearly defines the specific days for which each job share is<br/>responsible. Both teachers shall attend summer school training and receive<br/>compensation pursuant to Section G. Summer school job share partners shall be<br/>responsible for ensuring that continuity of instruction is maintained throughout the<br/>summer school term. Job share teachers will not be eligible for summer school sick<br/>leave. In placing job share applicants, the District shall use the “highest” summer<br/>school priority of the two (2) job share partners.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 25</p>
<p>PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW (PAR) PROGRAM</p>
<p>A. Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program allows exemplary teachers to<br/>assist certain permanent and beginning teachers in the areas of subject matter<br/>knowledge, teaching strategies, teaching methods, and classroom management.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent of the program’s assistance and review depends on whether the<br/>participating teacher is a beginning teacher, a volunteer permanent teacher, or a<br/>permanent teacher who has received an unsatisfactory evaluation in one or more<br/>areas of teaching methods and/or instruction. The program’s assistance shall be<br/>provided through Consulting Teachers as described in detail in Sections C and</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>D-2 of this document. This assistance shall not involve the participation in, nor<br/>the conducting of the annual evaluation of certificated unit members as set forth<br/>in Article 9 of the Agreement and Education Code 44660, et seq., except for<br/>making available to the evaluator the results of a unit member’s participation in<br/>the Program.</p>
<p>B. Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Participating Teacher”</p>
<p>A unit member who is a classroom teacher who either volunteers, or is required<br/>by this Agreement to participate in the program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Consulting Teacher”</p>
<p>An exemplary teacher selected to provide program assistance to the participating<br/>teachers and who meets the qualifications listed in subsection D.2.a.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Beginning Teacher”</p>
<p>Any unit member having probationary or temporary status, or any District<br/>teaching intern participating in a program established according to Education<br/>Code Sections 44305, et seq. and 44325, et seq.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Voluntary Participating Teacher”</p>
<p>Any unit member with permanent status who requests assistance from the<br/>consulting teacher, or any unit member with permanent status whose last<br/>performance evaluation was rated satisfactory and who selects the alternative<br/>evaluation under Section 9-B of the Agreement and who elects to have a<br/>Consulting Teacher assist in that Alternative Evaluation Program.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Participating Teacher with an Unsatisfactory Evaluation”</p>
<p>A unit member with permanent status whose most recent performance evaluation<br/>contained an unsatisfactory evaluation in one or more areas of subject matter<br/>knowledge, teaching strategies, and/or teaching methods and instruction, as<br/>specifically designated by Article 9, Section A-4-a-d of the Agreement, and<br/>standards “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4” on the Permanent Teacher Evaluation Report<br/>form.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Joint Panel”</p>
<p>The Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program will be administered by a panel<br/>consisting of seven members, four selected by the Association and three<br/>appointed by the District. A panel member’s term shall be three years, except</p>
<p>the first terms will be determined by lot on the basis of two two-year terms, two</p>
<p>three-year terms, and three four-year terms.</p>
<p>C. Program Outline</p>
<p>1. For Participating Teachers with an Unsatisfactory Evaluation</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any permanent teacher with an unsatisfactory evaluation in one or more<br/>area listed in Section B-5 must participate in the program.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher’s assistance and review shall focus on the<br/>specific areas recommended for improvement by the Participating<br/>Teacher’s evaluator after the Participating Teacher receives the<br/>unsatisfactory rating. (Refer to Article 9, C-3-e)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations shall be written, aligned with student<br/>learning, clearly stated, and consistent with Education Code<br/>Section 44662. These recommendations shall be considered as<br/>the performance goals required by Education Code Sections<br/>44664(a) and 44500(b) (2).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principal and Consulting Teachers assigned to the<br/>Participating Teacher shall meet and discuss the recommended<br/>areas of improvement outlined by the Principal and the types of<br/>assistance that should be provided by the Consulting Teacher.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher and the evaluating principal are expected<br/>to establish a cooperative relationship and shall coordinate and<br/>align the assistance provided to the Participating Teacher.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher and the Participating Teacher shall meet to<br/>discuss the plan for assistance. Thereafter, the Consulting Teacher will<br/>provide assistance, which shall also involve multiple classroom<br/>observations of the Participating Teacher.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before April 1, the Consulting Teacher shall complete a written report<br/>regarding the teacher’s participation in the program consisting of: (1) a<br/>description of the assistance provided to the Participating Teacher; and (2)<br/>an analysis of the Participating Teacher’s improvement resulting from<br/>assistance in the targeted areas. This report shall be submitted to the<br/>Joint Panel. The Consulting Teacher shall also prepare a written<br/>summary of the assistance provided to the Participating Teacher which<br/>shall be submitted to the Joint Panel for review/approval and then<br/>forwarded to the evaluating principal. The principal may attach the<br/>summary to the Participating Teacher’s evaluation.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing the report, the Joint Panel shall determine whether the<br/>teacher would benefit from continued participation in the Program.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Panel will make an annual report to the Governing Board and<br/>the Association regarding the impact of the program, improvements to be<br/>made in the program, and any recommendations regarding program<br/>participants, including forwarding the names of the permanent teachers<br/>with unsatisfactory evaluation who, after sustained assistance, would not<br/>benefit from continued participation in the program.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher will continue participating in the program until the Joint Panel<br/>decides that the teacher will not benefit from continuation in the program,<br/>or the teacher receives a satisfactory evaluation, or the teacher is<br/>separated from the District. The evaluating principal and the District have<br/>the sole authority to determine whether the Participating Teacher has<br/>been able to demonstrate satisfactory improvement.</p>
<p>1. The Consulting Teacher’s report, as defined in subsection C-1-d<br/>above, shall be made available to the District for placement in the<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Beginning Teachers</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Consulting Teacher will be assigned to each Beginning Teacher to<br/>provide assistance. In the first year, the Consulting Teacher shall<br/>concentrate the assistance in the area of the District’s Teaching<br/>Standards. In the second year, the Consulting Teacher will focus the<br/>assistance in any areas which may be listed by the evaluating principal as<br/>needing improvement and/or assistance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher and the evaluating principal shall have a<br/>cooperative relationship, and shall coordinate the assistance provided to<br/>the Beginning Teachers.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the participation of Beginning Teachers is not legally mandated,<br/>neither the Consulting Teacher nor the Joint Panel will make a written<br/>report or forward the names of any individual beginning teacher who<br/>participates in the program. The Joint Panel will, however, annually report<br/>on the overall effectiveness of the program for beginning teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Voluntary Participating Teachers</p>
<p>a. Any unit member with permanent status who requests assistance from the<br/>Consulting Teacher, or those teachers participating in an alternative<br/>evaluation program set forth in Section 9-D of the Agreement may utilize</p>
<p>the services of a Consulting Teacher as one option in the alternative<br/>system.</p>
<p>b. Because permanent teachers with satisfactory performances are not<br/>mandated by law to participate in the program, neither the Consulting<br/>Teacher nor the Joint Panel will report on any volunteer participation in the<br/>program. Any reports to the Governing Board or the Joint Panel will be<br/>made only as required by the individual plan. All other reports and<br/>recommendations will be governed by Article 9 of the Agreement.</p>
<p>D. Governance and Program Structure</p>
<p>1. Joint Panel</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program will be administered by<br/>a panel consisting of seven members, four selected by the Association<br/>and three appointed by the District.

The Joint Panel will make the<br/>selection, which will be forwarded to the Superintendent. The panel’s<br/>procedures for selecting Consulting Teachers shall include provisions for<br/>classroom observation of Consulting Teacher candidates.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Consulting Teacher’s term will be three years. A Consulting Teacher<br/>may request to return to regular teaching duties prior to conclusion of the<br/>three-year term, and they will be returned to regular duties at the<br/>beginning of the next school year. The District will return the teacher to<br/>the position held before assuming the Consulting Teacher position. This<br/>guarantee to return to the same position shall not entitle the teacher to any<br/>rights greater than would be attained by remaining in the position.</p>

<p>APPENDIX H</p>
<p>Philosophy Goals-Objectives and<br/>Comprehensive Plans</p>
<p>TEACHER-ADMINISTRATION LIAISON COMMITTEE</p>
<p>Education has expanded rapidly in the past decade in complexity, diversity, and<br/>technology. All principals’ responsibility for maintaining effective communication with<br/>staff and community is increasingly demanding. In some instances, the size of school<br/>staff has grown to the point where more formalized lines of communication between<br/>staff and building administrator needs to be established. The need for this is generally<br/>recognized by both the building administrator and the staff.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of professionals that they recognize the importance of open channels<br/>of communication in solving their mutual problems, meeting their mutual responsibilities,<br/>and cooperating in many decision-making processes essential to effective school<br/>operation.</p>
<p>In keeping with the above purposes, a Teacher-Administration Liaison Committee may<br/>be established at each school if in the administrator’s and faculty s judgment such a<br/>committee would facilitate the work.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee shall be elected by the non-administrative certificated personnel<br/>at each school.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal may meet and confer with the Committee upon request on matters<br/>within the scope of their authority.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the principal, the Committee may have the authority to<br/>schedule faculty meetings.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee may have the authority to place items on the agenda of the<br/>regular faculty meetings.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee may use up to 30 minutes at any faculty meeting to report on<br/>school activities.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in school procedures originated by the building administrator should, if<br/>at all feasible, first be discussed with the committee.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee may discuss with the principal other items as determined<br/>necessary by the committee, including, but not limited to, school budget,<br/>equipment, available supplies, etc.</p>

<p>Appendix M</p>
<p>AGREEMENT BETWEEN<br/>HUENEME ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND<br/>HUENEME EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>STRS Supplemental Benefit Program<br/>August 2002</p>
<p>The original STRS Defined Benefit Program provides eligible California certificated<br/>employees with a monthly retirement allowance, calculated based on the employee’s<br/>age at retirement years of service and highest 12 month's salary (final compensation).<br/>The employee and employer make contributions to the STRS Defined Benefit Program<br/>based upon a percentage of the employees' annual contract salary, In the past,<br/>additional income earned from extra duty assignments/stipends, for example, hourly<br/>extra time pay or summer school pay were not subject to STRS contributions, but did<br/>not enhance future retirement benefits.</p>
<p>Assembly Bill 2700 established the STRS Defined Benefit Supplemental (Supplemental)<br/>Program. The STRS Supplemental Program provides full time, eligible California<br/>certificated employees with an additional retirement allowance, above and beyond the<br/>regular Defined Benefit Program allowance, based upon employee and employer<br/>contributions from income earned from extra duty assignments For less than full time<br/>employees, the Supplemental Program provides an opportunity for extra duty pay to be<br/>applied toward full time service credit in the Defined Benefit Program, up to 100% of full<br/>time rt part time contract salary and extra duty pay equal 100% of a teacher's full time<br/>contract salary. The Supplemental Program allowance is paid as a lump sum<br/>distribution at the time of retirement or a monthly annuity for a fixed period of years<br/>following retirement, based upon total employer and employee contributions to the<br/>Supplemental Program during active employment.</p>
<p>In May 2002, representatives of the Hueneme Elementary School District and the<br/>Hueneme Education Association met to negotiate the impact of AB 2700. The parties<br/>utilized a summary of the provisions of AB 2700 developed by the Ventura County<br/>Superintendent of Schools Office to categonze the types of extra duty pay and other<br/>non salary compensation available to HEA unit members, and determine whether<br/>District/unit member STRS contributions would be directed to the Defined Benefit or<br/>Supplemental Program. A copy of the summary, Compensation Creditable Under AB<br/>2700 Summary is attached to this agreement. The summary refers to the Defined<br/>Benefits Program as the DB account, and the Defined Benefits Supplemental Program<br/>as the DBS account. The summary categorized nine (9) different types of extra duty<br/>and non salary compensation, examples of the category, and whether STRS<br/>contributions from the extra duty pay are transferred to the Supplemental Program, or<br/>remain in the Defined Benefit Program (in which case the extra duty pay is included in</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>STRS Supplemental Benefit Agreement<br/>Page 2</p>
<p>the calculation of the final compensation at retirement.) For less than full time<br/>employees, all extra duty pay and non salary contributions are transferred to the<br/>Defined Benefit Program until contributions from contract salary and extra duty pay<br/>equal 100% of full time contract salary, after which extra duty pay and other non salary<br/>contributions are transferred to the Supplemental Program, or the District Benefit<br/>Program depending on the category of extra duty pay.</p>
<p>The parties agree that extra-duty pay opportunities and other types of non salary<br/>compensation in the Hueneme School District are categorized as follows:</p>
<p>Category 1 - Time-based stipends without release time</p>
<p>Summer school pay; Saturday school pay; extra duty assignments paid at the contract<br/>$40.00 per nour extra time rate; after school stipends; adult education/CBET pay;<br/>stipends for attending staff development.</p>
<p>Category 2 - Non-time-based stipends without release time</p>
<p>Stipends tor PAR Consulting Teachers, Professional Growth Advisors, Teachers in<br/>Charge and Instructional Support Teachers; stipends for BTSA Support Providors;<br/>stipends for staff development trainers.</p>
<p>Category 5 - Compensation for special skills</p>
<p>Stipends for Miller Unruh Teachers, salary schedule longevity increments; stipends for<br/>Ph D. and NTBS certification</p>
<p>Category 6 - Bonus paid to all persons in class of employees<br/>Class Size stipends; oft salary schedule bonuses.</p>
<p>Category 7 - Allowances<br/>Mileage allowance</p>
<p>As necessary, the parties will meet to review these category designations, and<br/>categorize new types of extra duty or non salary compensation opportunities.</p>

<p>Lori Anaya's interests in pursuing the craft of painting and drawing extend over<br/>her thirty years of teaching second-language students in the Hueneme School<br/>District. Largely self-taught at first, she began a course of formal study,<br/>identifying and refining her artistic vision. Now, her focus on craft has led her to<br/>hear and pursue the narrative voice of the storyteller.</p>
