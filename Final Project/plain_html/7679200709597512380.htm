<p>21</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonding with a newborn infant or with a recently adopted child.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imminent danger to the home of a unit member, occasioned by a factor, such<br/>as flood or fire, serious in nature which under the circumstances, the unit<br/>member cannot reasonably be expected to disregard, and which requires the<br/>attention of the unit member during his or her assigned hours of service.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in court as a litigant, or as a witness under an official order. The<br/>unit member must return to work in cases where it is not necessary for him or<br/>her to be absent the entire day.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service as a pall bearer.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other instances of personal necessity as determined by the unit member, but<br/>within the guideline established in this policy and contingent upon the<br/>approval process described below.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>Advanced permission is not required for absences resulting from death, accident, or<br/>serious illness of members of a unit member’s immediate family or when a unit<br/>member’s home is in imminent danger. However, if the situation permits, unit members<br/>should alert the principal of the intended absence.</p>
<p>Verification of Reason for Absence - The unit member shall submit a signed statement<br/>and any additional proof requested by the principal or supervisor to substantiate<br/>personal necessity. However, in items 1 through 4 above, the unit member’s<br/>certification of absences due to any of the reasons cited shall be deemed to be<br/>appropriate verification or proof of the reason for absence. It is assumed that the unit<br/>member shall be the best judge of that which constitutes “serious illness” inasmuch as<br/>there is no legal definition for the term. This is also true of imminent danger to one’s<br/>home.</p>
<p>Absence in Excess of Seven (7) Days - Absence for personal necessity in excess of<br/>seven (7) days per year or in excess of full-time sick days, will normally be considered<br/>personal leave involving loss of salary. However, in the event of unusual circumstances<br/>and with the superintendent’s approval, permission may be granted for an additional<br/>three (3) days of personal necessity (beyond the seven). In the event the unit member<br/>is absent for more than ten (10) days, substitute differential pay shall be deducted from<br/>the unit member’s daily rate. The Board must approve any personal necessity leave<br/>that exceeds ten (10) days. If the Board denies an extension, additional time off shall<br/>result in full loss of pay for the additional days absent.</p>
<p>Limitations - Absences for personal necessity must be taken in increments of not less<br/>than one-half day.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Personal necessity leave shall not be granted during a scheduled vacation or leave of<br/>absence.</p>
<p>Payment for such absence shall be made only upon certification of the unit member’s<br/>administrator or immediate supervisor or the superintendent that the absence was due<br/>to a personal necessity within the meaning of the policy.</p>
<p>In all cases of personal necessity leave, it must be demonstrated that the need for such<br/>absence cannot be accomplished outside of the regular duty hours.</p>
<p>Procedure - The need for personal necessity leave shall be indicated on a DISTRICT<br/>approved form attached hereto as Appendix E. The unit member will state the reason<br/>the absence is necessary and relate it to one of the eligibility items in this policy. The<br/>form - Unit Members Request for Personal Necessity Leave, shall be submitted to the<br/>immediate administrator at least three (3) days prior to the proposed absence, if this is<br/>feasible, but in all cases will be submitted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On occasion, the need for personal necessity leave may be so personal and potentially<br/>embarrassing in nature that a written description of the reason for the request on the<br/>absence report would place an unreasonable demand upon the unit member. In this<br/>instance, the unit member shall meet with the superintendent and explain that he or she<br/>is requesting a privacy personal necessity leave. When that occurs, the superintendent<br/>will authorize the leave under the policy. A copy of such authorization shall be sent to<br/>the principal and the payroll clerk.</p>
<p>In cases where personal necessity leave is denied at the superintendency level, the<br/>decision may be appealed to the Grievance Representatives of the ASSOCIATION, the<br/>superintendent and one principal. The superintendent will appoint the principal. Appeal<br/>from the committee ruling may be made to the Board.</p>
<p>JUDICIAL AND OFFICIAL APPEARANCE</p>
<p>The Board shall grant leaves of absences to unit members to appear as a witness in<br/>court other than as a litigant or to respond to an official order from another<br/>governmental jurisdiction for reasons not brought about through the misconduct of the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>The Board shall grant leaves of absence to unit members in positions requiring<br/>certification qualifications, regularly called for jury duty in the manner provided for by<br/>law.</p>
<p>The Board shall grant such leaves of absence with full pay while a unit member serves<br/>on jury duty. However, all payment the unit member receives as a result of jury duty,<br/>with the exception of mileage, shall be returned to the DISTRICT.</p>
<p>MATERNITY LEAVE</p>
<p>The DISTRICT shall grant a leave of absence from duty to any female unit member of<br/>the DISTRICT who is required to be absent from duties because of pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery there from.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>The length of the leave of absence, including the date on which the leave shall begin,<br/>and the date on which the unit member shall resume duties, shall be determined by the<br/>unit member and the unit member’s doctor</p>
<p>A written statement from the unit member’s doctor must be furnished by the unit<br/>member giving the date when, in the doctor’s judgment, the unit member may return to<br/>work.</p>
<p>Absences necessitated by disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, or childbirth shall be treated the same as leaves for illness.</p>
<p>Should accumulated sick leave be exhausted during the period of leave authorized bv a<br/>physician, the unit member shall receive substitute differential pay for a period of one<br/>hundred working days. Substitute differential pay means the salary paid the substitute<br/>shall be deducted from the unit member’s regular salary. The substitute’s pay shall be<br/>in accordance with DISTRICT policy.</p>
<p>Should the unit member wish to extend the leave beyond the date the doctor<br/>determines she may return to work, she shall request a leave without pay.</p>

<p>Types of Leaves</p>
<p>Sabbatical leave for full-time study and/or approved travel for one semester or one<br/>school year may be granted to a unit member as approved by the Board pursuant to<br/>these provisions.

<p>applied for sabbatical leave, preference shall be given to seniority or successful<br/>previous service.</p>

The Board may waive this deadline. Applications shall consist of a<br/>detailed plan and the completion of a form provided by the superintendent.</p>

All health and welfare benefits shall remain at the same level as for full¬<br/>time unit members of the DISTRICT. The DISTRICT shall pay the retirement benefit on<br/>the basis of salary paid - one-half. (Should a unit member wish full-time salary credit<br/>for the sabbatical year, the unit member must contact the State Teachers’ Retirement<br/>System and make the necessary arrangements. Upon completion of the process, the<br/>DISTRICT, when billed by the State Teachers’ Retirement System, shall pay the<br/>additional DISTRICT share due.)</p>
<p>Evidence of Fulfillment of Leave - Each unit member returning from leave shall file with<br/>the superintendent or designee before he or she returns to duty a transcript of work<br/>taken and grades earned, or summary of his or her trip together with a statement of<br/>educational growth believed to be obtained and any other evidence that he or she has<br/>met the objectives stated in the application. In addition to the final summary and/or<br/>transcript, the unit member on sabbatical leave shall submit to the superintendent or<br/>designee, a brief progress report once each semester during the leave.</p>
<p>College Units Earned While on Sabbatical Leave - College credits earned during<br/>sabbatical leave may be utilized to meet the requirements for advancement on the<br/>salary schedule.</p>

<p>Post Bond - Each unit member who is granted a sabbatical leave is required to post a<br/>bond guaranteeing service to the DISTRICT for a period twice the length of the<br/>sabbatical leave immediately following the leave. Cost of the bond is borne by the unit<br/>member. The bond shall be exonerated in the event the failure of the unit member to<br/>return and render the required service is caused by the death or the physical or mental<br/>disability of the unit member. The requirement for the bond may be waived by<br/>resolution to the Board of Trustees at its discretion.</p>
<p>Liability of Board and DISTRICT - Both the Board and the DISTRICT shall be freed from<br/>any liability for the payment of any compensation or damages provided by law for the<br/>death or injury of any unit member while on sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>25</p>

The superintendent or designee must be notified in writing within<br/>ten (10) days from the first day of such injury or illness.</p>
<p>Employment while on Leave - While on sabbatical leave, a unit member may not accept<br/>any other employment unless it pertains directly to the purpose and programs of the<br/>sabbatical leave and then only with the written approval of the superintendent or<br/>designee. In no case will the amount received from sabbatical leave pay and<br/>remuneration from other employment, grants, or stipends exceed the regular salary of<br/>the unit member. Should the amount of the other remuneration, grant, or stipend be<br/>sufficient to cause the unit member’s salary to exceed the sabbatical leave, pay will be<br/>reduced by the amount sufficient to reduce the total anticipated salary to the amount the<br/>unit member would have received had he or she not taken the leave.</p>
<p>Other - In all matters not herein mentioned, the Education Code shall govern sabbatical<br/>leave, and all amendments to the Education Code affecting sabbatical leave shall<br/>become a part of these rules and regulations.</p>
<p>SICK LEAVE</p>
<p>All regular unit members shall be granted sick leave for absence from duty occasioned<br/>by reason of personal illness or accident, of ten (10) days, excluding school holidays, in<br/>any one school year, on full pay provided that regular unit members assigned for a<br/>fractional part of any school year shall be entitled to such leave pay in the same ratio<br/>that the assignment bears to full-time.</p>
<p>Each regular unit member who does not use the entire period of his or her annual sick<br/>leave in any school year shall have added to his or her credit annually the number of<br/>unused days and the same shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>Unit members who are ill beyond the number of days of accumulated sick leave shall be<br/>paid the difference between their salary and the salary paid a substitute.

Should a unit member have more than five (5) months and ten (10) days<br/>(110 days sick leave) accumulated sick leave, the unit member would continue to<br/>receive payment until the sick leave is exhausted.</p>
<p>For the purpose of establishing the salary per day, the total yearly salary shall be<br/>divided by the total number of service days from the time unit members are required to<br/>report to duty until the last day of school in the term.</p>

The State Board of Education shall adopt rules and regulations prescribing the<br/>manner in which the first district shall certify to the second district, the total amount of<br/>leave of absence for illness or injury to be transferred. The Board shall not adopt any<br/>policy or rule, written or unwritten, which requires any certificated employee transferring<br/>to its district to waive any part or all of the leave of absence which he or she may be<br/>entitled to have transferred in accordance with this section.</p>
<p>Compulsory Leave of Absence - Whenever any unit member of a school district is<br/>charged with the commission of any sex offense as defined in Section 44010 of the<br/>Education Code by complaint, information or indictment filed in a court of competent<br/>jurisdiction, the Board shall immediately place the unit member upon compulsory leave<br/>of absence for a period of time extending for not more that ten (10) days after the date<br/>of the entry of the judgment in the proceedings.

If the unit member is acquitted of the<br/>offense, or the charges against him or her are dismissed, the DISTRICT shall reimburse<br/>the unit member for the cost of the bond upon his or her return to service in the<br/>DISTRICT.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day<br/>of authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal<br/>year, the unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave<br/>due him or her for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member<br/>shall be entitled to the benefits provided in the Education Code, and for the<br/>purpose of each of these sections, his or her absence shall be deemed to<br/>have commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or<br/>illness leave, provided that if the unit member continues to receive<br/>temporary disability indemnity, he or she may elect to take as much of his or<br/>her accumulated sick leave which, when added to his or her temporary<br/>disability indemnity, will result in a payment to him or her of not more than<br/>his or her full salary.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the unit member shall endorse to the<br/>DISTRICT, the temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of<br/>his or her industrial accident or illness.

<p>Approval may be given for attendance at meetings of professional and civic<br/>organizations or for attendance at professional conferences.</p>
<p>UNAUTHORIZED LEAVE</p>
<p>The Board, while adopting this policy, recognizes that the unit members of this<br/>DISTRICT are a group of conscientious and dedicated professionals who frequently<br/>devote many hours to the students of the DISTRICT beyond that which is required by<br/>the Board. This policy, therefore, is directed toward that rare instance, or individual,<br/>who does not reflect the standards established by the staff.</p>
<p>Any absence covered under this policy shall be recorded in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file in the form of a letter written by the superintendent or his or her designee,<br/>a copy of which shall be provided the unit member who may respond to the<br/>superintendent.</p>
<p>Repeated absence as covered in this policy shall be reported in the unit member’s<br/>formal evaluation and shall subject the unit member to possible dismissal.</p>
<p>After a conference with the superintendent, the salary of a unit member who willfully or<br/>repeatedly absents himself or herself from duty may be reduced on an hourly basis as<br/>pro-rated according to the normal work load as established in DISTRICT policy.</p>
<p>Absence from duty, as used in this policy, includes unauthorized absence from staff<br/>meetings, curriculum meetings, or any other meetings or activities legally called by<br/>administrators.</p>
<p>Supervisory personnel shall report to the superintendent the name of any unit member<br/>who is absent without authorized leave.</p>
<p>It is expected that this policy will be administered judiciously and not as an instrument of<br/>harassment or as a manner of dealing with trivial and unique occurrences.</p>
<p>CHILD CARE LEAVE</p>
<p>Unit members may be granted parental child care leave of up to one year for the<br/>purpose of caring for a newly born or newly adopted child.</p>
<p>Such leave is without pay and benefits of any kind.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Request for such leave must be made at least four (4) weeks prior to the requested<br/>beginning date.</p>
<p>The beginning date and duration of such leave shall be at the discretion of the Board, in<br/>consultation with the unit member and considering the needs of the DISTRICTS<br/>educational program.</p>
<p>If the unit member’s leave commences after the school year has begun, and terminates<br/>prior to the end of the same school year, the unit member shall be entitled to return to<br/>his or her assignment.</p>
<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE</p>
<p>Unit members who have exhausted all their sick leave may use catastrophic leave<br/>under the following provisions:</p>
<p>Catastrophic leave shall begin no sooner than the eleventh (11<sup>th</sup>) work day of absence,<br/>and only after all other personal accumulated sick leave and other paid time off has<br/>been exhausted.</p>
<p>Maximum leave is not to exceed twelve (12) consecutive calendar months, or the<br/>maximum number of days donated pursuant to this section, whichever is less.</p>
<p>To request catastrophic leave, the unit member, or his or her designee, shall submit a<br/>request in writing to the ASSOCIATION President stating the facts that support a need<br/>for catastrophic leave.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for such leave, the unit member will have suffered an illness or<br/>injury that is expected to incapacitate the unit member for an extended<br/>period of time, or that incapacitates a member of the unit member’s family,<br/>which incapacity requires the unit member to take time off work for an<br/>extended period of time to care for that family member, and taking<br/>extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the unit member<br/>because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave and other<br/>paid time off.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “member of the unit member’s family” shall be limited to spouse,<br/>children, mother, father, or an individual over which the unit member has<br/>legal guardianship.</p>
<p>Upon application by a unit member for catastrophic leave, four (4) ASSOCIATION<br/>appointed unit members and one (1) DISTRICT designated administrator shall meet<br/>and determine whether to grant a catastrophic leave, and the number of days to be<br/>granted.</p>
<p>If the request is denied, the ASSOCIATION President shall notify the unit member or his<br/>or her designee and the Superintendent.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are denied a withdrawal, or whose<br/>withdrawal is terminated, may, within thirty (30) days of denial, appeal to the Executive<br/>Board of the ASSOCIATION. The Executive Board of the ASSOCIATION shall hold a</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>hearing within fifteen (15) duty days, and announce its decision within fifteen (15) duty<br/>days of the hearing.</p>
<p>If the request is approved, the ASSOCIATION shall solicit the unit members in the<br/>ASSOCIATION on a mutually approved form authorizing donation of sick leave days for<br/>use pursuant to this section.</p>
<p>The ASSOCIATION President will provide the superintendent with a list of names of the<br/>unit members donating sick leave and the number of days donated by each unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee shall have the responsibility of maintaining the<br/>records of the Catastrophic Leave Bank, receiving withdrawal requests, approving or<br/>denying the requests, and communicating its decisions to the participants and the<br/>personnel and/or Payroll Department.</p>
<p>The Committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the Bank. The<br/>Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests complying with the terms of<br/>this Article.</p>
<p>Applications shall be reviewed and decisions of the Committee reported to the applicant<br/>within ten (10) days of the receipt of the application.</p>
<p>The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose the nature of<br/>the illness except as is necessary to process the request for withdrawal or defend<br/>against any appeals of denials.</p>
<p>By October 5<sup>th</sup> of each school year, the DISTRICT shall notify the Committee of the<br/>following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of accumulated days in the Bank on June 30<sup>th</sup> of the<br/>previous school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days contributed by unit members for the current year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of participating unit members.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days available in the Bank.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a reasonable and timely request by the ASSOCIATION President,<br/>updates of additional unit members participating, and current days in the<br/>Bank will be provided.</p>
<p>Days donated and taken pursuant to this section shall be credited, deducted, or donated<br/>in full day increments.</p>
<p>The maximum number of days a unit member can contribute per year pursuant to this<br/>section is ten (10).</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank shall be reduced by one full day for each day of<br/>Catastrophic Sick Leave awarded to the requesting unit member.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>In the event that days donated to the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank are not used, then<br/>those days will be retained in the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank for future use as<br/>granted by the local ASSOCIATION/DISTRICT Committee referred above.</p>
<p>Unit members using Catastrophic Sick Leave pursuant to this section shall not accrue<br/>any other leave credits provided for in the AGREEMENT, or by law.</p>
<p>If the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in<br/>the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank shall be returned to the then current members of the<br/>Bank proportionately.</p>
<p>Nothing herein preempts the right of the ASSOCIATION to solicit voluntary contributions<br/>of sick leave for the purpose of establishing a Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank prior to<br/>application by a given unit member.</p>
<p>The ASSOCIATION may voluntarily contribute Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank days to a<br/>DISTRICT Administrator. Likewise, the DISTRICT Administrators may reciprocate by<br/>volunteering Catastrophic Sick Leave days to the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank<br/>referred to herein.</p>
<p>ARTICLE X<br/>ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS</p>
<p>General Provisions</p>
<p>In accordance with Education Code Section 35035, the Superintendent<br/>may assign and transfer unit members within the District, limited only by<br/>the express procedures contained in this Article.</p>
<p>A transfer/reassignment may be initiated by a unit member or initiated by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>In making transfers and reassignments, the District shall consider such<br/>educationally related criteria as:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member request</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District seniority</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous evaluations pursuant to contract Article XI11</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials and certifications</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College units, degrees and specialized training</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous teaching experience related to the position</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements of the position</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The needs to balance teaching skills and abilities (as specified in<br/>the Standards for the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession)</p>
<p>The above criteria are not listed in priority order.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>In considering transfers/reassignment of more than one unit member, if<br/>the District determines that the above criteria are equal, District seniority<br/>shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>In the event that a unit member receives a “needs improvement” or<br/>“unsatisfactory” evaluation, the District reserves the right to consider a<br/>District initiated reassignment or District initiated transfer as options for<br/>placing the unit member in an assignment which may better suit the skills<br/>and talents of that unit member.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>“Position” - A DISTRICT determined teaching assignment</p>
<p>“Vacancy”- A vacancy is any position that does not have a unit member<br/>assigned to it. This includes any vacated or newly created position,<br/>including position created by reconfiguration or restructuring and any<br/>instructional programs offered by the District.</p>
<p>“Reassignment”- A change in grade or department assignment within a<br/>given school.</p>
<p>“Transfer”- The movement of a unit member from one school to another<br/>within the District.</p>
<p>“Retreat Rights” - The opportunity for a unit member assigned to a<br/>specialized instructional assignment (Literacy Coach, English Language<br/>Development Teacher, Teacher on Special Assignment, Site Instructional<br/>Coach, Community Day School Teacher) to voluntarily return to a previous<br/>regular class position at the end of a school year, or at dissolution of such<br/>specialized position.</p>
<p>Posting of Job Vacancies</p>
<p>The District shall post on the District’s website, District e-mail and on a<br/>bulletin board at each school and the District Office, vacancies for<br/>bargaining unit positions.</p>
<p>Prior to making tentative assignments, the site principal will<br/>announce site vacancies and their requirements to the site staff.<br/>These vacancies shall be sent via e-mail and posted in the site office.<br/>Each vacancy announcement shall remain posted for a period of at<br/>least three (3) business days, during which time bargaining unit<br/>members may apply. Such posting(s) shall include pertinent<br/>information about the vacancy (including specific skills and other<br/>requirements) and the deadline for submitting requests for<br/>consideration. The district shall post all other vacancies for the<br/>following school year for all unit members until two weeks after the<br/>last day of school.

<p>No assignment to fill the vacancy shall be made until after the closing date<br/>of the posting.</p>
<p>Unit members may submit to the District Office a written request for each<br/>such vacancy.</p>
<p>Unit Member Initiated Transfer</p>
<p>Request for Transfer</p>
<p>A unit member may submit a request for transfer or request to exercise<br/>Retreat Rights for the upcoming academic year (July 1 - June 30) to the<br/>District office at any time, whether or not a vacancy exists. Such requests<br/>shall remain on file until September 1 of the upcoming school year and will<br/>be considered as vacancies occur. A unit member may also submit a<br/>request for transfer or Retreat Rights in response to the posting of a<br/>vacancy pursuant to the procedures of this Article. After receiving all unit<br/>member requests for transfer to a specific assignment, the unit member<br/>with the most District seniority (of those who have submitted a written<br/>request) shall receive the transfer.</p>
<p>Notification of Disposition of Transfer Requests</p>
<p>The District shall notify the unit member of the disposition of his/her<br/>request for transfer. Upon request of the unit member, within ten (10)<br/>business days the District shall provide in writing the reasons for not being<br/>selected for the vacancy.</p>
<p>District Initiated Transfer</p>
<p>The District may initiate a transfer when there are no unit members<br/>requesting the transfer. The District shall make such transfers with<br/>minimal disruption to the bargaining unit. Prior to making any district<br/>initiated transfer, the District shall consider but not be required to transfer,<br/>unit members with requests on file and those who have responded to a<br/>posted vacancy.</p>
<p>Prior to a district initiated transfer, the Superintendent will schedule a<br/>meeting to discuss the reasons for the transfer with the unit member.</p>
<p>Upon request of the unit member, an ASSOCIATION representative may<br/>attend this meeting. If the meeting cannot be scheduled with ten (10)<br/>business days, the Superintendent will provide the unit member with a<br/>notice of the transfer. Upon request of the unit member, within ten (10)<br/>business days the reasons for the transfer shall be given in writing.</p>

Such release time shall be scheduled with the current<br/>Principal approval.</p>
<p>In addition, a transfer initiated by the District to a grade or subject matter<br/>not taught within the past two (2) years shall entitle the unit member, upon<br/>request up to two (2) days of release time during the first year of the<br/>assignment for the purposes of visitations, professional growth, meetings<br/>with mentors, planning and development of curriculum materials. Such<br/>release time shall be scheduled with the current Principal approval.</p>
<p>A transfer initiated by the District involving a change in grade level or<br/>subject matter shall entitle the unit member to an additional classroom<br/>materials/resources budget of $750.00. Expenditures shall be made with<br/>site Principal approval and consistent with District purchasing policies and<br/>procedures.</p>
<p>The District shall provide assistance in moving the unit member’s<br/>materials.</p>
<p>A transfer of a unit member initiated by the District shall not result in a<br/>reduction of the teacher’s regular salary or seniority of the unit member.</p>
<p>Reassignment Process</p>
<p>Prior to making tentative assignments, the site principal will announce site<br/>vacancies and their requirements to the site staff. These vacancies shall<br/>be sent via e-mail and posted in the site office. Each vacancy<br/>announcement shall remain posted for a period of at least three (3)<br/>business days, during which time bargaining unit member may apply,<br/>such posting(s) shall include pertinent information about the vacancy<br/>(including specific skills and other requirements) and the deadline for<br/>submitting requests for consideration.</p>
<p>Unit Member-Initiated Reassignment</p>
<p>Unit members who wish to be considered for reassignment or exercise<br/>Retreat Rights may file a written request with the principal at any time for<br/>the upcoming academic school year (July 1 - June 30). Such requests<br/>shall remain on file until September 1 of the upcoming academic school<br/>year. After receiving all unit member requests for a specific assignment,<br/>the unit member with the most District seniority (of those who have<br/>submitted written requests) shall receive the reassignment.</p>
<p>District-Initiated Reassignment</p>
<p>Prior to making any District initiated reassignment, the Principal will<br/>schedule a meeting with the unit member to discuss the reassignment. In</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>the event that no unit members at a site request reassignment for a<br/>specific vacancy, the vacancy shall be sent via email to all unit members<br/>and posted at all site offices for a period of at least three (3) business<br/>days, during which time, unit members may file a written request with the<br/>Superintendent requesting a transfer to fill the specific vacancy. (See Unit<br/>Member-Initiated Transfer language). The District may initiate a<br/>reassignment when there are no unit members requesting the<br/>reassignment. The District shall make such reassignments with minimal<br/>disruption to the bargaining unit.</p>
<p>The Principal shall give each teacher his/her tentative class assignment(s)<br/>for the upcoming school year by May 10<sup>th</sup> of the current academic school<br/>year. In the event of an occurrence after this date, such as death,<br/>resignation, change in enrollment, or other unforeseen circumstances,<br/>assignments may be changed by the Principal.</p>
<p>If a reassignment is made after the beginning of school, a unit member,<br/>upon request, shall be allowed two (2) days of release time for preparation<br/>prior to the reassignment. Such release time shall be scheduled with the<br/>Principal.</p>
<p>In addition, a unit member reassigned to a grade or subject matter not<br/>taught within the past two (2) years shall be allowed, upon request and<br/>with Principal approval, up to two (2) days of release time during the first<br/>year of the assignment for the purposes of visitations, professional growth,<br/>meetings with mentors, planning and/or development of curriculum<br/>materials.</p>
<p>A reassignment initiated by the District shall entitle the unit member to an<br/>additional classroom materials/resources budget of $750.00.</p>
<p>Expenditures shall be made with site Principal approval and consistent<br/>with District purchasing policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The District shall provide necessary assistance in moving the unit<br/>member’s materials.</p>
<p>Self-Contained Combination Classroom Assignment</p>
<p>Unit member assignment to a regular self-contained combination<br/>classroom will be for one year only unless the unit member wishes to<br/>continue with a self-contained combination class. Self-contained<br/>combination classroom assignments will be rotated among unit members<br/>at the affected grade levels on that school site. Rotation will be based on<br/>the least recent self-contained combination classroom experience and<br/>then the use of reassignment considerations cited in Section 10.1.3<br/>above. The District will provide one (1) hour of District funded aide time<br/>for each self-contained combination class above that provided single<br/>grade classrooms at the site.</p>
<p>Transitional Kindergarten will not be considered for a combination<br/>classroom assignment.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Unit members assigned to a self-contained combination class will receive<br/>the following benefits beginning with the 2006-07 school year.</p>
<p>Three release days during the school year. Particular days<br/>must be on campus and approved by the building principal.</p>
<p>The District will make every effort when establishing classes<br/>to fill the self-contained combination class first.</p>
<p>If requested by the unit member, for the following year’s assignment, the<br/>unit member assigned a self-contained combination classroom will be<br/>returned to the previous single grade level assignment taught. If, however,<br/>pupil numbers or extenuating circumstances render this impossible, the<br/>Reassignment language above will be applied to the situation.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI</p>
<p>SAFETY CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>The Board shall maintain facilities utilized by unit members in such a manner that they<br/>are not hazardous or unsafe. Unit members shall not be required to work under unsafe,<br/>hazardous, or unsanitary conditions.</p>
<p>Any condition deemed to be unsafe by a unit member shall be reported in writing to his<br/>or her immediate supervisor. Any action or response shall be provided by the<br/>supervisor in writing. A copy shall be submitted to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>If a delay of corrective action would result in the health or safety of unit members and/or<br/>students being jeopardized, the Administration shall take all necessary steps to remove<br/>unit members and/or students from endangerment immediately.</p>
<p>If the unit member is not satisfied with the action or response, he or she may file a<br/>grievance. Once a condition has been reported by the unit member, in writing, the<br/>condition becomes the responsibility of the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>In the event that the DISTRICT receives any information from recognized public<br/>entity(ies)/agency(ies), that a student, his or her parents or guardian have a known,<br/>established history of dangerous, violent and/or disturbed behavior, the building<br/>administrator will fonlvard such information to the unit member(s) of that student within<br/>24 hours when school is in session. The unit member and principal/site administrator<br/>shall discuss student needs and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Conditions may arise which are not covered by the safety plan. The unit member shall<br/>consult the local administrator for direction in such situations. In the absence of<br/>administrative direction, the unit member shall take reasonable and prudent action.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>Maximum class sizes shall be:</p>
<p>30 students in an elementary classroom (the DISTRICT recognizes that it is receiving<br/>funding to provide for some grade levels to be at a ratio of 20 or less students per<br/>grade, maximums which are well within the existing class size provision).</p>
<p>The DISTRICT and RBEEA further recognize the suggested maximum class sizes at 20<br/>students or less in grades K-3. It is understood that this suggested class size maximum<br/>shall be in place only as long as the State continues to fund class size reduction.<br/>Whenever a situation exists that makes it impractical or financially undesirable to relieve<br/>a class size which exceeds the suggested maximum, the DISTRICT will consider<br/>various options including possible employment of an Instructional Assistant on a<br/>temporary basis except in such instances as are not educationally sound, financially<br/>sound, and/or in the best interests of the DISTRICT, taking into consideration the<br/>student, unit member and DISTRICT needs.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32 students in a 7-8 academic or elective class at the middle school</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40 students in a 7-8 Physical Education class at the middle school</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 students in a Special Day class (SDC)</p>
<p>Whenever a situation exists that makes it impractical or financially undesirable to relieve<br/>oversized classes, the Board commits itself to search for a means of alleviating the<br/>situation including the possible employment of Instructional Assistants on a temporary<br/>basis. Copies of the monthly enrollment summary shall be sent to the ASSOCIATION<br/>President.</p>
<p>The principal shall meet with the unit member to discuss possible assistance. A form<br/>entitled “Verification of Conference Regarding Class Size” shall be completed and sent<br/>to the superintendent upon conclusion of the conference. (See Appendix F)</p>
<p>K-6 Level</p>
<p>A Special Day class student in a regular unit member’s classroom for more than one<br/>period per day would count as one student when determining class size (physical<br/>education is excluded).</p>
<p>A severely physically handicapped student in the regular classroom will count as two<br/>students when determining class size. The site administrator will make the final<br/>decision as to whether the child is &quot;severely” physically handicapped after consultation<br/>with the unit member.</p>
<p>7-8 Level</p>
<p>There will be a per class maximum of 32 in academics or electives at the middle school.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>There will be a per class maximum of 40 in physical education at the middle school.</p>
<p>Site administrators shall make every effort to schedule classes with a beginning<br/>minimum of 20 students.</p>
<p>If an individual unit member has five or more Special Day Class (SDC) students for a<br/>class period, the Special Day Class assistant or Special Day Class unit member must<br/>accompany the five students (physical education is excluded).</p>
<p>A severely physically handicapped student in the regular classroom will count as two<br/>students when determining class size. The site administrator will make the final<br/>decision as to whether the child is “severely” physically handicapped after consultation<br/>with the unit member.</p>
<p>The Board also commits itself to maintain Special Education classes at a level<br/>consistent with state law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>EVALUATION</p>
<p>DISTRICT GUIDELINES FOR UNIT MEMBER EVALUATION</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>Evaluation for all unit members will be implemented in accordance with the following<br/>guidelines:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose is for improvement of the competence of the unit member<br/>and thereby the improvement of quality of education of the DISTRICTS<br/>students.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation shall apply to all unit members.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member evaluated shall participate in the setting of standards.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of the competence of unit members shall be<br/>based upon the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (Herein<br/>after referred to as CSTP). Data to facilitate such unit member<br/>evaluations shall be secured through products, judgments, observations,<br/>responsibilities carried, anecdotal records, and monitoring student<br/>progress. The systematic and effective collection of these data in relation<br/>to the CSTP will provide the basis for evaluation and assessment.</p>
<p>Philosophy</p>
<p>The Board members, administrators, and unit members of the DISTRICT are committed<br/>to the continuation of the DISTRICTS strong education program. Effective evaluation<br/>that focuses on the improvement of instruction is a key component of this educational<br/>program.</p>
<p>The evaluation process must be continuous and constructive and take place in an<br/>atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. The process is a cooperative effort on the part</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>of the evaluator and unit member. It is designed to encourage productive dialogue<br/>among unit members, between unit members and supervisors, and to promote<br/>professional growth and development. This process will be effective because<br/>administrators take seriously their role as instructional leaders and are dedicated to the<br/>growth of unit members.</p>
<p>Evaluation Schedule</p>
<p>Each probationary unit member shall be evaluated by the administration each year<br/>using the CSTP (Appendix K). Unit members with less than ten (10) years of service to<br/>the District will be evaluated every other year. The exception to the above is outlined in<br/>Article XIII - Improvement Plan, item three (3). Permanent, tenured unit members with<br/>ten (10) or more years of service to the District shall be evaluated on a 4-year rotation<br/>schedule. The schedule listed below will be followed unless more frequent evaluation is<br/>deemed necessary by evaluator or employee for improvement of competency and/or<br/>performance.</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> Year (Formal Evaluation) - Evaluation shall be based upon the California Standards<br/>for the Teaching Profession (Appendix K).</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Year- Unit members are not evaluated this year.</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> Year- Professional Growth Year</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup> Year- Unit members are not evaluated this year if they have completed ten (10)<br/>years or more of service in the District provided that the three most recent evaluations<br/>were “meets or exceeds standards.”</p>
<p>Designation of Evaluator - The site principal is the evaluator for the unit member. The<br/>vice-principal may be designated as the evaluator provided it is mutually agreed upon<br/>by the principal and the unit member.</p>
<p>The evaluator for other non-teaching unit members will be designated by the<br/>superintendent through written notification by the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>Unit members serving at more than one school site will have their evaluators assigned<br/>by the superintendent, and written notification will be made to such unit members by the<br/>beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>In the event an evaluator is unable to fulfill his or her evaluative responsibilities due to<br/>illness, accident, etc., the superintendent will appoint a person to fulfill said<br/>responsibilities.</p>
<p>Unit members will not be requested to participate in the evaluation of other unit<br/>members</p>
<p>Professional Growth Year - For the Professional Growth Year, two (2) goals will be<br/>written by the unit member and discussed with the evaluator.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Professional Goals</p>
<p>The writing of goals is an integral part of teaching. Goals should be viewed as part of<br/>the annual planning process by the unit member. Goals should be written with the<br/>current assignment/class in mind in such a manner as to enhance the instructional<br/>program, desired areas of student progress, or improved instruction in the classroom.</p>
<p>Possible areas of focus include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Plan</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State Frameworks</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-study</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching strategies</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizational/administrative skills/processes</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learner outcomes/progress</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program development</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher as researcher</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Coaching with another unit member</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional portfolio</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of student work over time</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video training</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or other agreed-upon areas</p>
<p>In preparation for the Professional Growth year the unit member will receive a<br/>Professional Goals Form (Appendix G).</p>
<p>The professional goals review conference with the evaluator will be held by the tenth<br/>(10<sup>th</sup>) week of instruction. This is a collaborative conference which will involve<br/>discussion of professional goals.</p>
<p>Once the professional goals have been discussed, the unit member will provide the<br/>evaluator with a completed copy of the Professional Goals Form (Appendix G) within<br/>five (5) school days.</p>
<p>If a change of assignment requires modification of the original goals, the evaluator and<br/>the unit member will meet and discuss new goals at a mutually agreed upon time.</p>
<p>By the end of the school year the unit member will choose one of the following:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet with the evaluator to reflect on goals</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit a written “narrative” to site evaluator</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share learning(s) from goals during collaboration time</p>
<p>Time Line for Professional Growth Year</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the third (3<sup>rd</sup>) week of instruction- Notification of Professional Growth<br/>Year</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) week of instruction - Professional Goals Review<br/>conference.</p>

<p>FORMAL EVALUATION YEAR(S)</p>
<p>The formal evaluation year of the evaluation cycle will utilize the CSTP (Rubric for<br/>Professional Growth and Evaluation) Appendix K.</p>
<p>In preparation for the Formal evaluation process, the unit member will receive the<br/>Standards Selection Form (Appendix G[a]) from the evaluator.</p>
<p>For formal evaluations, the unit member will identify as a focus one of the standards, the<br/>evaluator will identify a second standard, and a third standard will be mutually identified<br/>and agreed upon.</p>
<p>The initial standard setting conference with the evaluator will be held by the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>)<br/>week of instruction. This conference will involve a collaborative discussion of potential<br/>standards, measurement/assessment techniques, and support requirements.</p>
<p>If agreement cannot be achieved, recommendations from a third party will be solicited.</p>
<p>If a third party is needed, the evaluator and unit member will first attempt to select the<br/>third party by mutual agreement. If mutual agreement on the person is not reached, the<br/>superintendent will name the third party. The third party named by the superintendent<br/>will not be a district employee.</p>
<p>If the third party cannot bring about agreement between the two parties, the<br/>superintendent will then make a decision. The superintendent’s decision may be<br/>appealed to the Board.</p>
<p>Once agreement has been reached on standards the unit member will provide the<br/>evaluator with a copy of the Formal Evaluation Standards Selection Form (Appendix<br/>G[a]) within five (5) school days.</p>
<p>If a change of assignment requires modification of the original standards the evaluator<br/>and the unit member will meet and set new standards at a mutually agreed upon time.</p>
<p>Observations - Formal classroom observations are an integral part of the evaluation<br/>process. Each probationary or temporary unit member being evaluated will be<br/>observed a minimum of two (2) times for twenty (20) minutes or more at mutually<br/>agreed upon dates and times. Each permanent unit member being evaluated will be<br/>observed a minimum of one (1) time for twenty (20) minutes or more at a mutually<br/>agreed upon date and time. All formal observations will have a required pre and post¬<br/>conference. (see Appendix H).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>A pre-observation conference will be used to establish the focus and content of the<br/>lesson and to provide the opportunity to select specific areas to be observed or<br/>discussed at the post-conference. This conference will be held the school day prior to<br/>the scheduled observation or an alternative date mutually agreed upon.</p>
<p>The post-observation conference purpose is to discuss and assess the lesson<br/>collaboratively; to focus on the specific areas determined in the pre-observation<br/>conference; and to establish possible future areas of focus. This conference will be<br/>held the day of the observation or the following school day, unless an alternate date is<br/>mutually agreed upon. If the unit member feels the observation does not reflect a fair<br/>assessment of his or her teaching, the unit member may request an additional<br/>observation.</p>
<p>The evaluator will provide a written summary of the lesson within five (5) school days<br/>following the post-observation conference (Appendix H). The unit member will have an<br/>opportunity to respond in writing. Within five (5) school days of having received the<br/>summary, the unit member will sign and return it to the evaluator. The unit member will<br/>receive a signed copy and the evaluator will keep the original.</p>
<p>Summative Evaluation Report - Appendix I - This report will be completed and signed<br/>at the scheduled summative evaluation conference by May 15 for permanent unit<br/>members and by March 1 for probationary or temporary unit members. At the<br/>conference, the evaluator and unit member will review together the Formal Evaluation<br/>Standards Selection Form (Appendix G[a]). The evaluator and unit member will then<br/>review and sign the Summative Evaluation Report Appendix I.</p>
<p>The Summative Evaluation Report will include ratings in the six Standards of the CSTP<br/>(refer to Appendix K):</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and Supporting All Students in Learning</p>

<p>If there is not AGREEMENT on aspects of the summative evaluation, the unit member<br/>may append a statement to the Summative Evaluation Form within ten (10) working<br/>days indicating the unit member’s response to the evaluation. The unit member’s<br/>statement will become a permanent part of the personnel file.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member who has received an unsatisfactory rating shall be directed<br/>by the DISTRICT to participate in the PAR program, designed to improve<br/>appropriate areas of his or her performance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DISTRICT reserves the right to consider a DISTRICT initiated<br/>reassignment or DISTRICT initiated transfer as options for placing the unit<br/>member in an assignment which may better suit the skills and talents of that<br/>unit member.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a permanent unit member has received a “Needs Improvement” or<br/>“Unsatisfactory” rating on the Summative Evaluation Form, the unit member<br/>will be evaluated annually until he or she receives a rating of “Meets or<br/>Exceeds Standards” in all specified areas or until he or she is no longer<br/>employed by the DISTRICT.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All written communication will provide space for the unit member’s signature<br/>and comments. The unit member will have the right to initiate a written<br/>response to the evaluation. This written response will become a permanent<br/>attachment to the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued unsatisfactory performance could result in dismissal in accordance<br/>with legal procedures as outlined in the California Education Code. (See<br/>Education Code sections 44930 through 44959 for time limitations and<br/>specific information regarding dismissal.)</p>

Such authorizations shall<br/>continue in effect from year-to-year unless revoked in writing. Pursuant to such<br/>authorization, the Board shall deduct one-tenth of such dues from the regular salary<br/>check of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit<br/>members who sign such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall<br/>be appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>Any unit member who is not a member of the ASSOCIATION or who does not make<br/>application for membership within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of<br/>teaching duties, may become a member of the ASSOCIATION or pay to the<br/>ASSOCIATION a fee in the amount equal to unified membership dues, initiation fees<br/>and general assessment or pay an equal amount into a legal/fund scholarship account<br/>to be used in the implementation of the grievance process or legal expense incurred in<br/>representing the unit, or scholarship program, to be administered by the<br/>ASSOCIATION. The Board will collect these fees upon written authorization by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>Agency Fees - Unit members hired by the DISTRICT and first employed after November<br/>1, 1998 shall within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this AGREEMENT or within<br/>thirty (30) days of their employment date, whichever is later, either join the<br/>ASSOCIATION by executing a payroll deduction authorization form for payment of dues<br/>or choose to pay a service fee to the ASSOCIATION. Unit members employed by the<br/>DISTRICT on and prior to November 1, 1998 shall be exempt from the Agency Fee<br/>provisions. Unit members who are employed by action of the Board after November 1,<br/>1998 and who fail to join the ASSOCIATION within thirty (30) days of the employment<br/>date shall pay an agency fee in an amount permitted by law and Public Employment<br/>Relations Board regulations, not to exceed the amount equal to the unified membership<br/>dues. Unit members affected by this provision may authorize payroll deduction of such<br/>agency fees. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the unit member from paying<br/>service fees directly to the ASSOCIATION. If a unit member withdraws a service fee<br/>authorization and fails to pay service fees directly to the ASSOCIATION, the DISTRICT<br/>shall, upon notification from the ASSOCIATION, deduct from the wages of any such unit<br/>member, and pay to the ASSOCIATION, all service fees owed to the ASSOCIATION as<br/>provided in Education Code section 45061.</p>
<p>The ASSOCIATION agrees to furnish any information needed by the Board to fulfill the<br/>provisions of this Article.</p>

The ASSOCIATION<br/>further agrees to pay to the DISTRICT all legal fees and legal costs incurred in<br/>defending against any court action and/or administrative action challenging the legality<br/>or constitutionality of the Agency Fee provisions of the AGREEMENT or their<br/>implementation. The ASSOCIATION shall have the exclusive right to decide and<br/>determine whether any such action or proceeding shall or shall not be compromised,<br/>resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXII</p>
<p>COMPLETION OF MEET AND NEGOTIATE</p>
