<p>Board refers to the Board of Education of the Alhambra Unified School District.</p>
<p>Days means work days during which a unit member is required to perform assigned<br/>duties and responsibilities, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>Hourly Rate of Pay means the daily rate of pay divided by six (6), except for a special<br/>duty assignment.</p>
<p>Temporary Unit Member is a unit member on an individual contract who is employed<br/>pursuant to Education Code Sections 44909 (categorical), 44917 - 44920 (temporary),<br/>or who is employed in a position which would be filled by a tenured or probationary<br/>unit member except for the fact that such unit member is on an authorized leave of<br/>absence. Tenured or probationary unit members assigned from the Districts’ General<br/>Fund to Categorically Funded Projects shall be deemed to be on an authorized leave<br/>of absence, but shall continue to receive all rights and benefits of a unit member<br/>assigned from the District General Fund.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of the foregoing powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities by<br/>the District, the adoption of policies, rules, regulations and practices in furtherance<br/>thereof, and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith, shall be<br/>limited only by the specific and express terms of this Agreement, and then only to the<br/>extent such specific and express terms are in conformance with the law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE III - ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every unit member who is a member of the Association, or who has applied for<br/>membership, or is an Agency Fee payer, shall sign and deliver to the District an<br/>assignment authorizing deduction of unified membership dues, initiation fees and<br/>general assessments in the Association. Pursuant to such authorization, the District<br/>shall deduct one tenth (1/10) of such dues from the regular salary check of the unit<br/>member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit members who sign<br/>such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall be appropriately<br/>prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year. Such authorization<br/>shall continue in effect from year to year unless revoked in writing. A unit member<br/>who revokes authorization for the payroll deduction or member dues or the non¬<br/>member fee shall transmit such dues or fee to the Association in a manner prescribed<br/>by the Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is not a member of the Association, or who fails to remain a<br/>member in good standing of the Association, or who does not make application for<br/>membership within thirty (30) days from the date of the effective date of this<br/>Agreement, or within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of assigned</p>
<p>duties, shall become a member of the Association or pay to the Association a service<br/>fee in an amount equal to unified membership dues, initiation fees, and general<br/>assessments. The unit member shall authorize payroll deduction for such service fee<br/>in the same manner as provided in Paragraph 1 of this Article. In the event that a unit<br/>member does not pay such fee directly to the Association or authorize payment<br/>through payroll deductions, as provided in Paragraph 1, the District shall immediately,<br/>upon notice from the Association that the unit member has not paid and that due<br/>process has been afforded, commence involuntary payroll deduction of said fee.<br/>Payment of said fee shall be a condition of continued employment. The Association<br/>represents to the District that it shall compute the service fee in the manner required by<br/>federal and state law.</p>
<p>Agency Fee Payers</p>
<p>A. Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional<br/>tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting<br/>employee organizations, or any unit member whose sincerely held religious<br/>beliefs include objections to joining or financially supporting employee<br/>organizations, shall not be required to join or financially support the<br/>Association as a condition of employment; except that such unit member shall<br/>pay, in lieu of a service fee as described in Paragraph 2 above, a sum equal to<br/>such service fee to one of the following non-religious, non-labor organization<br/>charitable funds exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of<br/>the Internal Revenue Code:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City of Hope</p>

<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Diabetes Association</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AID S Proj ect LA</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of payment and a written statement of religious objection, along with<br/>verifiable evidence of membership in a religious body or sincerely held<br/>religious beliefs, as described in Paragraph 3 A. above, shall be made on an<br/>annual basis to the District as a condition of continued exemption from the<br/>provisions of Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. Proof of payment shall be in<br/>the form of receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date<br/>of payment, and to whom payment in lieu of service fee has been made. The<br/>Association shall have the right of inspection in order to review said proof of<br/>payment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member making payments as set forth in Paragraphs 3. A. and B.<br/>above, and who requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this<br/>Agreement be used in his/her behalf, shall be responsible for paying the<br/>reasonable cost of using said grievance or arbitration procedures.</p>
<p>With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to authorization of the unit<br/>member, whether for membership dues or equivalent fee, the District agrees promptly<br/>to remit such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit<br/>members for whom such deductions have been made, categorizing them as to<br/>membership or non-membership in the Association, and indicating any changes in<br/>personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>
<p>The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the<br/>provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>District Indemnification</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the District<br/>against legal action by any certificated employee of the District challenging<br/>the legality of this Article — or its implementation.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District, upon receipt of notice of such legal action against it, shall inform<br/>the Association of such action.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, upon a compromise or settlement of such action,<br/>shall immediately pay to the parties to such action all sums due under<br/>such settlement or compromise.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, upon final order and judgment of a court of competent<br/>jurisdiction awarding damages to any party(ies) in such action, shall<br/>immediately pay to such party(ies) all sums owing under such order and<br/>judgment.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV - ASSOCIATION RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>1. Academic Freedom</p>
<p>The policy of the District is that all instruction shall be fair, relevant, accurate,<br/>balanced, objective and appropriate to the age and maturity of the student(s), and<br/>sensitive to the community needs and values of our diverse cultures and heritages.<br/>Academic freedom is essential to the fulfillment of this policy and the District<br/>acknowledges the fundamental need to protect unit members from censorship or<br/>restraint which might interfere with the unit member’s obligation to pursue truth in<br/>performance of their teaching functions. Accordingly:</p>
<p>A. A unit member shall have reasonable freedom in the classroom presentations<br/>and discussions, and may introduce political, religious or otherwise<br/>controversial materials, provided that said material is relevant to the course of<br/>study, within the scope of the law, and presented in a balanced way.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>B. In performing teaching functions, unit members shall have reasonable</p>
<p>freedom to express various points of view on all matters relevant to the course<br/>content, in an objective and balanced manner. A unit member, however, shall<br/>not utilize his/her position to indoctrinate, advocate or propagandize students<br/>with personal, political and/or religious views.</p>
<p>2. Personal Freedom</p>
<p>The personal life and/or sexual orientation of a unit member is not an appropriate<br/>concern of the District for purposes of evaluation unless it interferes with the unit<br/>member's performance of assigned duties.</p>
<p>Resonable Use of Facilities</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to reasonable use of school buildings<br/>and facilities for Association business in accordance with District policies.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorized representatives of the Association who are not employees of the<br/>District or of the Alhambra Teachers Association may enter the District’s<br/>premises upon notifying the school’s administrator of their presence.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association meetings shall be normally held after the working hours of the<br/>unit members who are required or will attend. On occasion, with the<br/>permission of the site or appropriate administrator, the Association shall have<br/>the right to conduct on-site activities during the regular school day if such<br/>normal activities of the Association do not interfere with the regular school<br/>duties.</p>
<p>The Association shall make reasonable use of the District’s mail service and unit<br/>members’ mailboxes for communication to unit members. “Reasonable use” shall<br/>mean any use consistent with law. All Association information distributed shall be<br/>specifically identified as coming from the Association. A copy of all Association<br/>information for unit member distribution distributed in unit members mail boxes or<br/>distributed through the District mail system shall be provided to site administrators<br/>and forwarded to the Superintendent at the same time as distributed to the unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>Names, addresses and telephone numbers of all members of the Association<br/>available in the District's computer personnel file, who have not denied permission,<br/>shall be provided to the Association on a monthly basis. The Association assumes<br/>complete responsibility for the use of this personnel file.</p>
<p>It is the duty and responsibility of each unit member to notify the District as soon as<br/>possible of any change in name, address of principal place of residence (exclusive of<br/>any post office box mailing address), and a telephone number where the unit member<br/>can be reached at any time in case of emergency.</p>

<p>Upon appropriate written authorization from the unit member, the District may deduct<br/>from the salary of any unit member and make appropriate remittance for annuities,<br/>credit union, savings bonds, charitable donations, or any other plans or programs<br/>approved by the District. The District shall transmit remittances made by payroll<br/>deduction as soon as practical after the issuance of pay warrants from which the<br/>deductions are made.</p>

The unit member’s written response<br/>shall be attached to the derogatory material and shall be placed in the<br/>personnel file within ten (10) days of receipt. The unit member shall be<br/>notified of the receipt and placement within ten (10) days.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the request of a unit member, derogatory material contained in<br/>the personnel file will be sealed four (4) years after inclusion in the file.<br/>Material so sealed may be reviewed only in special circumstances, after<br/>written notice to the unit member and in the presence of the unit member.</p>
<p>The unit member’s official evaluations shall be placed in the unit member’s<br/>file as submitted in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII<br/>(Evaluation Procedures), and are not subject to the review provisions of this Article<br/>nor may they be removed for any reason, except as provided in Paragraph 6.B. above.</p>
<p>ARTICLE X - LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>1. General Provisions and Definitions</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on paid leave of absence, unless otherwise provided herein,<br/>shall receive wages, salary step advancement, health and welfare coverage,<br/>and retirement credit (as provided by the California Education Code) in the<br/>same amounts as if they were not on leave. Those unit members who go on<br/>an unpaid leave of absence during any regular monthly pay period shall<br/>receive their health and welfare coverage for the balance of that pay period.<br/>Thereafter, they shall be allowed on continued coverage pursuant to the terms<br/>of the insurance plan selected at their own expense, provided that they made<br/>advance payments of the premium in a manner reasonably required by the<br/>District. Anytime a leave is denied, the unit member shall be provided, upon<br/>request, a written reason for the denial within a reasonable time. Such reasons<br/>are not grievable and shall not be placed in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leave of absence protects the unit member by holding a position in the<br/>District for the unit member in accordance with law until the leave expires,<br/>and by retaining for the unit member for one (1) year the right to return to the<br/>District in a position of the same position classification at the conclusion of<br/>the leave. Position classifications are those positions defined for unit<br/>members in Article I (Recognition).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member returning from a leave that was granted for a specific<br/>length of time shall report for duty at the conclusion of the leave or</p>
<p>shall be deemed to have resigned from the District. If the return date is at the<br/>beginning of the year, said notice shall be given to the unit member by the<br/>District on or before the preceding March 1. If the return date is during the<br/>school year, the District shall notify a unit member granted such leave at least<br/>forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the date of return. The failure to report<br/>for duty on the specified date shall be deemed a resignation. The notice shall<br/>be by certified mail at the unit member’s current mailing address on file with<br/>the District, and unit member must notify the District within thirty (30)<br/>calendar days that the unit member intends to return from leave or the unit<br/>member shall be deemed to have resigned.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each absence under this Article, except Item F, a unit member shall file<br/>a statement, provided by the District, specifying the reason for the absence.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member, whose absence under this Article exceeds five (5) consecutive<br/>days, shall, at the request of the District, provide a statement from a licensed<br/>physician or practitioner or other appropriate source verifying the reason for<br/>the absence.</p>
<p>E. It shall be the prerogative of the District to require verification of any absence<br/>of less than seven (7) consecutive days if the District has reason to believe that<br/>the purpose of the leave has been abused.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 31 st of each year, the District shall provide each unit member</p>
<p>with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a written statement of accrued sick leave as of June 30 of the previous</p>
<p>year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the entitlement for the current year. If the unit member does not</p>
<p>indicate within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the statement that he/she<br/>believes the statement is incorrect, the record will stand as correct.</p>
<p>2. Illness or Injury Leave</p>
<p>A. A unit member employed five (5) days a week during the regular school year<br/>shall be entitled to ten (10) days leave of absence for illness or injury,<br/>exclusive of all days not required to render service. A unit member employed<br/>for less than five (5) school days a week shall be entitled to that proportion of<br/>ten (10) days leave of absence for illness or injury as the number of days<br/>employed per week bears to five (5) school days. Unit members employed<br/>longer than the regular one hundred eighty-three (183) day work year shall be<br/>entitled to proportionate leave for injury or illness for the extra days work.</p>
<p>Pay for any day of such absence shall be the same as the pay which would<br/>have been received had the unit member served during the day. Credit for<br/>leave of absence need not be accrued prior to taking such leave by the unit<br/>member and such leave of absence may be taken at any time during the school<br/>year. If such unit member does not take the full amount of leave allowed in<br/>any school year the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>B. Unit members who are absent for illness or injury and have used up the total<br/>number of days of current and accumulated illness or injury leave shall<br/>receive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifty percent (50%) of their regular salary during an additional period</p>
<p>of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</p>
<p>additional period &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be a maximum of one hundred (100)</p>
<p>days.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are absent because of illness or injury or who have been<br/>hospitalized causing an absence for any day, may be required to submit to the<br/>District a medical report signed by the attending physician stating that the<br/>physical and/or medical condition causing the absence or hospitalization has<br/>been resolved to the degree that the unit member can fully execute the<br/>requirements of assigned duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this provision or any other provision of this Agreement shall<br/>preclude the Superintendent or designee from requiring a unit member to have<br/>a medical examination by a physician designated by the Superintendent or<br/>designee, at the District’s expense, to determine if the unit member can fully<br/>execute the requirements of assigned duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>3. Industrial Accident or Illness Leave</p>
<p>A. A unit member who is absent because of an injury or illness which</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>arose out of and in the course of employment shall be paid such portion of the salary<br/>due for any month in which the absence occurs as, when added to temporary disability<br/>indemnity under Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a payment<br/>of not more than full salary. The phrase “full salary” as utilized in this subdivision<br/>shall be computed so that it shall not be less than the unit member’s “average weekly<br/>earnings” as that phrase is utilized in Section 4453 of the Labor Code. For purposes of<br/>this section, however, the maximum and minimum average weekly earnings set forth<br/>in Section 4453 of the Labor Code shall otherwise not be deemed applicable.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of the absence.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall be for sixty (60) days in any one fiscal year for the same<br/>accident during which the schools of the District are required to be in session or when<br/>the unit member would otherwise have been performing assigned or authorized work<br/>for the District.</p>
<p>D. When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the unit<br/>member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due for the same illness<br/>or injury. Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member<br/>shall be entitled to the benefits provided in other appropriate provisions of the<br/>Agreement. For the purposes of these provisions the unit member’s absence shall be<br/>deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or<br/>illness leave, provided that, if the unit member continues to receive temporary<br/>disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much accumulated sick leave which,<br/>when added to temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment of not more<br/>than full salary.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the unit member will endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of industrial accident or<br/>illness. The District, in turn, shall issue the unit member appropriate salary warrants<br/>for payment of the unit member’s salary and shall deduct normal retirement and other<br/>authorized contributions.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member receiving benefits as a result of this provision shall, during periods<br/>of injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless written authorization<br/>of the Superintendent authorizes travel outside the State.</p>
<p>4. Act of Violence Leave</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member was physically injured during an act or acts of violence related<br/>to and during the performance of assigned duties, then Industrial Accident or Illness<br/>Leave may be extended beyond the initial 60 day period.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to qualify for such an extension the unit member must have:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notified the site administrator within 24 hours of the incident if the unit<br/>member was physically able to do so, and the unit member may report the<br/>incident to appropriate law enforcement authorities;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completed the unit member’s written report and reported for treatment and/or<br/>evaluation as required by Worker’s Compensation procedures;</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied in writing to the Superintendent, or designee, for such an extension<br/>using a District form. Such application should be filed with the<br/>Superintendent, or designee, as soon as the unit member sees the need for such<br/>an extension, so that the District has adequate time to review and process the<br/>claim prior to the effective date of the leave extension.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination whether the injury was the result of an act of violence, and whether<br/>the act of violence was related to and during the performance of duties, shall be<br/>made in the reasonable judgment of the Superintendent, or designee.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination whether the injury is disabling beyond the initial 60 day period<br/>of Industrial Accident or Illness Leave shall be made in the reasonable medical<br/>judgment of the treating physician.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extended leave, if granted, shall be paid at the unit member’s regular rate,<br/>and the unit member’s fringe benefits shall continue during the extended leave.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave will commence after the expiration of the unit members initial 60 days<br/>of Industrial Accident or Illness Leave, and may not continue after the unit member<br/>qualifies for permanent and stationary treatment under Workers’ Compensation or<br/>STRS disability.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any monies received from Workers’ Compensation for the extended leave will be<br/>refunded to the District.</p>
<p>5. Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>A. Creation and Purpose</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank is a program established to allow unit members to<br/>potentially help each other. The intent of this program is to provide a way that unit<br/>members who have exhausted all their regular sick leave may apply for additional<br/>sick leave days from the bank for a catastrophic injury or illness.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>Catastrophic illness and injury shall be defined as a serious illness or injury that<br/>incapacitates a unit member or a member of the unit member’s family for an<br/>extended period of time requiring the Catastrophic Leave Bank member to take<br/>time off from work to care for himself/herself or to take care of a family member<br/>(see definition of family under Article X.9.B Bereavement Leave).</p>
<p>Unit members who have exhausted all sick leave and who are members of the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank may request withdrawal of additional sick days from<br/>the Bank for a catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to create a Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank effective July 1, 2011. The Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>shall be funded in accordance with the terms of Section X.A.2 below.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this section, a “day” shall be any day a unit member<br/>is required to be on duty as determined by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank does not apply to summer school, intersession<br/>or any extra teaching assignment.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank not to a specific employee and<br/>withdrawn from the Bank without regard to the daily rate of pay of the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank participant.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by a joint committee<br/>comprised of three (3) voluntary members appointed by the Association and<br/>two (2) members appointed by the District.</p>
<p>B. Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on active duty with the District are eligible to</p>
<p>contribute to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank shall be voluntary. Only unit members</p>
<p>that are current on their contributions will be permitted to request a<br/>withdrawal from the Bank.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank must be authorized and renewed</p>
<p>annually by the unit member on the appropriate district form.<br/>Contributions shall be made each year during the Medical Benefits<br/>Open Enrollment period or thirty (30) days from a new employees<br/>date of hire. The effective date of coverage shall be the first day of<br/>the month following enrollment. Forms shall be returned to the<br/>Human Resources Office.</p>
<p>Membership from the Bank is revoked automatically whenever a<br/>member fails to make his/her annual contribution (during Open<br/>Enrollment period).</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to the Bank shall<br/>not be returned to the unit member if the unit member effects<br/>cancellation from the Bank.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning from unpaid leave of absence which included<br/>the enrollment period will be permitted to contribute to the Bank within<br/>30 calendar days of returning to work.</p>
<p>Enrollment forms for the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be available<br/>to all new unit members and those unit members returning from leave.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of contribution by each participating unit member for<br/>each school year shall be the equivalent of one (1) monthly allocated<br/>sick day allowance.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days in the Bank falls below fifty (50) days,<br/>the Joint Committee will open an additional period of 10 days<br/>during which current Catastrophic Leave Bank members may<br/>contribute on a voluntary basis one additional day.</p>
<p>Those unit members wishing to join the Bank for the first time<br/>may also contribute at this time.</p>
<p>Failure to contribute during this additional request period from<br/>the Joint Committee will not cause a Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>member to cease participation in the Bank.</p>
<p>If the Bank does not have sufficient days to meet a withdrawal<br/>request, the Joint Committee is under no obligation to provide<br/>days and the District is under no obligation to pay the unit<br/>member any funds whatsoever.</p>
<p>If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason,<br/>the days remaining in the Bank, if any, shall be returned to the<br/>then current (that fiscal year) donors in a proportionate manner.<br/>Any such redistribution shall be in not less than half-day units<br/>and each donor’s rebate shall be limited to his/her total<br/>donations to the bank.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days in the Bank at the end of the school year<br/>(June 30) exceeds six hundred (600) days, no contributions</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>shall be required of continuing Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>participants for the next school year.</p>
<p>Unit members joining the Catastrophic Leave Bank for the<br/>first time or those returning from leave shall be required to<br/>contribute one day to the Bank to participate in the Bank.</p>
<p>C. Procedures for Withdrawal of Days from the Bank</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Bank participants whose sick leave or industrial</p>
<p>accident/illness leave and sick leave is exhausted may request<br/>withdrawal from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>There will be a ten (10) day waiting period. This waiting period<br/>must be covered by the last days of sick leave, the unit members<br/>differential leave, leave without pay or a combination of the leaves.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may submit requests for extensions of withdrawals as<br/>their prior grants expire. Extension for a continuous illness or<br/>injury shall have no additional waiting period. If the request is for<br/>an extension, an updated physician’s statement of the illness or<br/>injury must be presented to the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Bank members, who have exhausted all</p>
<p>accumulated sick leave, but still have differential leave available are<br/>eligible to request a withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank.<br/>The District shall pay the unit member full pay and the Bank shall<br/>be charged not more than one-half (1/2) day.</p>
<p>The receipt of a donated sick leave credit as defined herein, when<br/>combined with other district income, shall not provide the recipient<br/>with a greater monthly district income than he/she received<br/>immediately prior to the receipt of the catastrophic sick leave.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a reoccurrence or a second illness or injury incapacitates a<br/>member or a member of the unit member’s family within the same<br/>school year, it shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5)<br/>consecutive days. (Thus, a unit member who used the Bank, after<br/>exhaustion of sick leave, for 20 days to care for the member’s<br/>spouse who dies of cancer, and, after returning to work, suffers a<br/>heart attack, shall be deemed to have a second catastrophic illness<br/>and may again withdraw from the bank after five (5) consecutive<br/>days off work).</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Joint Committee that are unused by the</p>
<p>unit member shall be returned to the Bank upon the unit member’s<br/>return to work after the illness or injury.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is incapacitated, applications may be submitted<br/>to the Joint Committee by the unit member’s representative as<br/>designated on the Catastrophic Leave Bank enrollment form.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in<br/>units of no more than twenty (20) days. Unit members may submit<br/>requests for extensions of withdrawals as their prior grants expire.</p>
<p>A unit member’s withdrawal from the bank may not exceed the<br/>statutory maximum of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal<br/>from the Catastrophic Leave Bank will be required to submit a<br/>physician’s statement indicating the nature of the illness or injury<br/>and the probable length of absence from work. Members of the Joint<br/>Committee shall keep information regarding the nature of the illness<br/>confidential. The Joint Committee may require a medical review by<br/>a physician of the Committee’s choice at the District’s expense.<br/>Refusal to submit to the medical review will nullify the unit<br/>member’s application. A unit member’s withdrawal may not exceed<br/>the annual salary of the participant.</p>
<p>D. Other Provisions</p>
<p>1) All decisions of the Catastrophic Leave Bank Joint Committee are<br/>final and shall not be subject to appeal, or subject to the grievance<br/>provisions of the Agreement.</p>
<p>2) Participation in the Catastrophic Leave Bank is completely voluntary<br/>on the part of both donors and applicants. In order to participate in<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank, the unit member must waive any and<br/>all claims against the District and/or the Association arising from the<br/>administration of the Catastrophic Leave Program by signing a<br/>waiver and release which reads as follows:</p>
<p>As a requirement of, and as consideration for my participation the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank created by Article X (Leaves of Absence)</p>
<p>in the Agreement between the parties, I_,</p>
<p>hereby waive and release any and all claims I may now have, or<br/>may have in the future, known or unknown, against the</p>
<p>Alhambra Unified School District and/or the Alhambra Teachers<br/>Association in connection with the administration of the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank Program.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participant’s donating sick leave days to the Bank should be aware<br/>that their donation may impact their STRS years of service upon<br/>retirement by the number of the days donated to the Program.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceedings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;materials related to the Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>Bank shall be strictly confidential. Therefore, Joint Committee<br/>members may only disclose suchinformation as is necessary to<br/>administer this Article.</p>
<p>Pregnancy Leave</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide for leave of absence from duty for any certificated<br/>employee of the District who is required to be absent from duties because of<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom. The length of the<br/>leave of absence, including the date on which the leave shall commence and<br/>the date on which the unit member shall resume duties, shall be determined by<br/>the unit member and the unit member’s physician.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and<br/>recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and<br/>shall be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or<br/>sick leave plan available in connection with employment by the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided herein, written and unwritten employment policies<br/>and practices of the District shall be applied to disability due to<br/>pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions applied to<br/>other temporary disabilities.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>A. A unit member who is entitled to illness or injury leave shall be entitled to<br/>personal necessity leave within the following limits and conditions:</p>
<p>1) The total number of days allowed in a school year under this Article<br/>shall not exceed ten (10). In cases of personal necessity such as<br/>serious illness or accident of an immediate family member, extended<br/>bereavement or adoption of a child, a unit member may use up to 50%<br/>of the unit member’s accumulated sick leave. A unit member may<br/>apply to the Superintendent for up to the full amount of accumulated<br/>sick leave.</p>
<p>1) The days allowed shall be deducted from and may not exceed the</p>
<p>number of full days of illness or injury absence which the unit member<br/>is allowed.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>2) Personal necessity leave may be utilized for circumstances that are<br/>serious in nature, which cannot be expected to be disregarded, which<br/>necessitate immediate attention, and which cannot be dealt with during<br/>off-duty hours.</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to a bereavement leave of not to exceed five (5)<br/>days without loss of salary in case of the death of a member of their<br/>immediate family. These days shall be reasonably related to the death.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate family is defined as mother, father, grandparent, or a grandchild of<br/>the unit member, or of the spouse of the unit member. Spouse, son, son-in-<br/>law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother, sister, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law<br/>of the unit member, significant other (someone who is uniquely and<br/>particularly important to the unit member), or any relative living in the<br/>immediate household of the unit member, or any other person for whom the<br/>unit member is legally responsible are considered immediate family for the<br/>purpose of this article.</p>

<p>A reassignment is a change of the previous placement of a unit member to a position<br/>within the same location or administrative division, including change of grade level<br/>or subject matter. Reassignments shall not be made in an arbitrary or capricious<br/>manner, but for program and/or facilities requirements.

<p>If a unit member is reassigned to a new classroom or preparation after the opening of<br/>school, the District shall provide the unit member with two (2) days of released time<br/>to prepare for the new assignment. At the high school level, a classroom re¬<br/>assignment is defined as a permanent change in classroom for fifty percent (50%) or<br/>more of the unit member's total assignment.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVI - TRANSFERS</p>
<p>A transfer is a change of schools within the Alhambra City School District or the<br/>Alhambra City High School District. Transfers between the two Districts are<br/>governed by the Education Code requirements for Common Administration of<br/>Common Boards of Education. In particular, unit members in one District do not<br/>have employment rights in the other District and may transfer from one District to the<br/>other only by mutual agreement between the District and the unit member. The<br/>following is the transfer procedure for transfers within each District and does not<br/>apply to transfers between Districts. Changes in assignment for unit members who<br/>are assigned to two or more schools or administrative divisions, regardless of District,<br/>shall not be considered a transfer. “Opening” shall refer to a growth position which<br/>the District determines to fill with a permanent or probationary bargaining unit<br/>member (as opposed to a substitute or temporary certificated employee). “Vacancy”<br/>shall refer to an available existing position which the District determines to fill with a<br/>permanent or probationary bargaining unit member (as opposed to a substitute or<br/>temporary certificated employee).</p>
<p>A. The District shall post at each school location, notice of each known</p>
<p>unit member opening or vacancy, together with a deadline for applications<br/>which shall be no less than ten (10) days prior to the unit member opening or<br/>vacancy being filled. However, the District may, in cases where a unit<br/>member opening or vacancy occurs within ten (10) days of the first day of<br/>school or after the first day of school, fill such position for the remainder of<br/>the school year without going through any posting procedures or transfer<br/>considerations. If the position is to be retained, it is to be posted as a unit<br/>member opening or vacancy for the following school year.</p>
<p>S3</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall post at each school location notice of all openings or<br/>vacancies that exist for nurses, librarians, psychologists, audiologists,<br/>counselors and instructional specialists.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All openings or vacancies in high school department head positions<br/>shall be posted and applicants accepted on a district-wide basis.</p>
<p>The District shall, upon request by a unit member, notify that member during<br/>summer recess of any posted unit member openings or vacancies which may arise<br/>during the summer. The unit member’s request, filed prior to June 1 with the Human<br/>Resources Division, must be in writing, must include a summer mailing address and,<br/>when possible, a telephone number.</p>
<p>Filing a request for filling a unit member opening or vacancy as indicated in<br/>Paragraph 2, shall be considered a request for a voluntary transfer and is without<br/>prejudice to the teacher and shall not jeopardize the teacher’s present assignment.</p>
<p>A request for transfer may be withdrawn by the teacher in writing to the Human<br/>Resources Division at any time prior to official notification of the transfer.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be utilized to determine which teacher is granted a<br/>voluntary transfer:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possession of an appropriate credential, major/minor and appropriate recent</p>
<p>experience for the opening.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements of the District’s Affirmative Action program.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The educational needs of the District, such as General Program changes or<br/>requirements, the District’s Bilingual Program requirements (as approved by<br/>OCR - Office of Civil Rights), Special Education Program requirements,<br/>changes in graduation requirements.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent written evaluation is satisfactory or better.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member with the greatest District seniority shall receive the transfer,<br/>provided the above factors are equal.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall, upon request of the unit member, give written reasons why<br/>the request for transfer was denied. The reasons shall not be grievable and<br/>shall not be placed in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>Involuntary Transfers - teachers may be involuntarily transferred for the following<br/>reasons:</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>A. Declining enrollment.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluctuations in pupil enrollment. An overstaffed or surplus situation<br/>may be deemed to exist when the number of teachers present in a given<br/>school, after the beginning of the school year, exceeds the ratios established<br/>by Article XIII (Staffing-Class Size).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements of the District’s Affirmative Action program.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance renewal - A unit member may be involuntarily transferred no<br/>more than once every three (3) years in order to improve performance if the<br/>deficiencies in performance have been reflected in the most recent official<br/>written evaluation of the teacher.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification adjustment - A unit member may be transferred if it is<br/>determined that the assignment is in violation of credential authorization.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The educational needs of the District, such as General Program changes or<br/>requirements, the District’s Bilingual Program requirements (as approved by<br/>OCR - Office of Civil Rights), categorically-funded program requirements.<br/>Special Education Program requirements, changes in graduation requirements.</p>
<p>When an involuntary transfer is deemed necessary, then the following shall occur:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member(s) under consideration for involuntary transfer shall<br/>be notified.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) days of the notification, the unit member(s) may request and<br/>will be granted a meeting with the administrator initiating the transfer for both<br/>parties to discuss and consider alternatives to the proposed transfer. Upon<br/>request, the unit member(s) shall receive written reasons for the transfer.</p>
<p>Such request shall be made within five (5) days following the meeting. The<br/>administrator shall provide the written rationale within five (5) days of the<br/>request.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members involuntarily transferred, except Paragraph 7.D., shall have<br/>equal opportunity to interview for available unfilled positions. When a choice<br/>of unfilled positions is possible, unit members may indicate an order of<br/>preference.</p>
<p>The determination of which unit member shall be involuntarily transferred shall be</p>
<p>based upon the following factors (not applicable to Paragraph 7.D.):</p>
<p>A. Possession of the appropriate credential, major/minor and appropriate recent<br/>experience.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The educational needs of the District such as General Program changes and<br/>requirements, the District’s Bilingual Program requirements. Special<br/>Education Program requirements. Categorically Funded Program<br/>requirements, change in graduation requirements.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements of the District’s Affirmative Action Program.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member with the lowest seniority in the District shall be transferred,<br/>provided the above factors are equal.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is involuntarily transferred pursuant to Section 7. A or 7.B above, the<br/>District shall provide, by seniority order, such unit member his/her choice of available<br/>openings.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member receives a transfer to another site after the opening of school, he/she<br/>shall receive three (3) days of release time to pack, move, and set up the classroom.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is transferred or reassigned to a different location within the school,<br/>then the District shall provide reasonable assistance in moving materials.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSP teachers who are located at one site shall have the same rights as all other<br/>certificated employees under Article XVI, sections 6 an 7, Voluntary and Involuntary</p>
<p>transfer.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVII - EVALUATION</p>

<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation and assessment of unit members’ competence pursuant<br/>to the provisions shall not include the use of publishers’ norms<br/>established by standardized tests, the results of tests utilized for the<br/>purpose of a school improvement plan, or the achievement of specific<br/>objectives stated in Individual Educational Programs (IEPs) of Special<br/>Education students, unless included in the unit member’s evaluation<br/>goals and objectives.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not base an evaluation of a unit member, in whole or<br/>in part, on derogatory information provided by District or non-district<br/>personnel unless such derogatory information has been reviewed by<br/>the same procedures in Article IX (Human Resources office files) of</p>
<p>this agreement, including specifically the procedures set forth in Article IX,<br/>Section 5, which prohibit the District from placing in personnel files<br/>anonymous information and provides due process procedures for contesting<br/>derogatory material from other sources.</p>
<p>Permanent and Probationary Unit Members Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are to be evaluated will be so notified by the appropriate<br/>administrator no later than October 1 of each school year. Such notice shall<br/>be accompanied by a copy of this Article. Under exceptional circumstances,<br/>the immediate supervisor of a unit member who has not been previously<br/>notified may institute formal evaluation procedures at any time during the<br/>school year. This evaluation shall be in conformity with the provisions of this<br/>Article, except that timelines for the meeting of the objectives shall be<br/>adjusted as required and carried over into the next school year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By November 1 of each school year, the unit member shall develop written<br/>objectives appropriate to the unit member’s assignment. The unit member<br/>may request assistance in writing these objectives. These objectives shall be<br/>submitted to the appropriate administrator for approval. These objectives<br/>shall specify at least what is to be done, when it will be done, and under what<br/>conditions it will be done. No more than four (4) objectives may be required.<br/>Objectives shall be stated so that they may be measured or observed and<br/>related to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession:</p>
<p>S7</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard One: Engaging and supporting all students in learning.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Two: Creating and maintaining effective environments for<br/>student learning.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Three: Understanding and organizing subject matter for<br/>student learning.</p>

<p>Normally these objectives will be affected within the current school year. For<br/>each objective, at least one (1) technique of assessment will be stated. The<br/>use of a variety of assessment techniques is encouraged. Examples may<br/>include, but are not limited to, observation, statistical studies, anecdotal<br/>records, conferences, and related reports, standardized tests not based on<br/>publisher norms and teacher-constructed tests.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall establish and define job responsibilities for non-instructional<br/>unit members whose responsibilities cannot be evaluated appropriately under<br/>the provisions of Paragraph B .2. above and shall evaluate and assess the<br/>competence of such unit members as it reasonably relates to the fulfillment of<br/>those responsibilities.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member’s evaluator disagrees with the proposed objectives and<br/>assessment techniques, and such disagreement is not resolved by<br/>November 1, the disagreement may be referred, by either party, to the<br/>Assistant Superintendent-Instruction who shall review the unit member’s<br/>proposed objectives, the evaluator’s objectives, and make a decision which is<br/>binding on both parties.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, circumstances may change which<br/>may require new objectives or modification of the original objectives. At the<br/>request of either party, the original plan shall be reviewed for possible<br/>revision. The determination of new evaluation objectives or revision of the<br/>original objectives shall be arrived at as in Paragraph 2.A. and B. above with<br/>the exception that said objectives as defined in G below, will be presented<br/>within ten (10) days.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the primary basis of evaluation is the establishment of pre-defined<br/>objectives, written directives by the evaluator responsive to spontaneous</p>
<p>school-related circumstances may be included in the evaluation process when<br/>necessary. The unit member may include any written specific objections to<br/>these directives.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a situation arises under 2 E and 2 F brought on by &quot;circumstances&quot;<br/>that have changed and &quot;spontaneous school-related circumstances&quot; that create<br/>written directives from an evaluator which are different than the &quot;pre-defined&quot;<br/>objectives, and if there is a disagreement, such new objectives shall be<br/>referred to the Assistant Superintendent-Instruction, who shall review the<br/>proposed objective(s) and make a decision which is binding on both parties,<br/>subject to the process described in 2D.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process shall include, but is not limited to, the following<br/>activities:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) formal class observation of forty (40) minutes or more duration. At<br/>least two (2) days advance notice by the evaluator to the unit member for the<br/>formal observation to be given.</p>

<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who receive unsatisfactory observations shall be entitled, upon<br/>request to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional observations by the site administrator and/or, by<br/>mutual agreement, an evaluator other than the site administrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written evaluations designed to improve their performance.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator’s role in assisting the unit member shall include, but not be<br/>limited to, the following:</p>

<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator may request a unit member to assist another unit member in<br/>need of assistance. The Association encourages unit members to voluntarily<br/>assist another unit member when requested by the evaluator. Unit members<br/>shall not formally evaluate another unit member when in the course of<br/>rendering assistance.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final written evaluation by the evaluator, based upon information and data<br/>assembled during the evaluation period, shall be discussed with the unit<br/>member at least thirty (30) calendar days before the last school day scheduled<br/>on the school calendar adopted by the Board of Education for the school year<br/>in which the evaluation takes place. If the unit member receives an<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation, the District may include the requirement that the<br/>unit member shall participate in a program designed by the District to improve<br/>appropriate areas of the unit member’s performance and further both student<br/>achievement and the District’s objectives. Such requirements shall be<br/>reasonable and shall not result in any expense to the unit member.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members have the right to initiate a written response or reaction to the<br/>evaluation. The written response shall become a permanent attachment to the<br/>evaluation. The final evaluation plus all accompanying documents shall be<br/>filed in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content and/or substance of the evaluation reasonably applied shall not be<br/>subject to Article VII (Grievance Procedures). Procedural violations of this<br/>Evaluation Article are subject to Article VII (Grievance Procedures).</p>
<p>3. Temporary Unit Member Evaluation Procedures</p>

<p>(1) increment (step) for one (1) year of comparable service, up to a<br/>maximum of seven (7) years of service with the maximum placement on<br/>step eight (8). (Except for Speech and Language Pathologist Teachers who<br/>are to receive year for year service). For unit members hired before<br/>September 1, 1998, the allowed credit is (1) increment (step) for (1) year<br/>comparable service, up to a maximum of five (5) years service with the<br/>maximum placement of step (six (6).

Private school<br/>experience for step increment on the salary schedule will be accepted,<br/>providing the private school was state accredited at the time of the unit<br/>member’s employment. All previous experience shall be verified by official<br/>statements by prior employers before experience credit will be allowed.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment as a day-to-day substitute, practice teaching, teacher assisting or<br/>internship programs shall not be used in computing years of service for salary<br/>placement. All course work approved for initial placement must be verified<br/>by official transcripts. It is the responsibility of the new unit member to<br/>provide the District with a complete set of official transcripts for all course<br/>work completed prior to the effective date of initial employment. These<br/>transcripts must be received by the District within ninety (90) days from the<br/>date of initial employment. An extension of time of ninety (90) days will be<br/>granted if the unit member shows proof that he/she has attempted to secure<br/>the transcripts within the specified amount of time. All transcripts received<br/>after ninety (90) days from the date of initial employment or after the<br/>extension of time, regardless of when those units were completed, will be<br/>considered under other provisions of this Agreement relating to column<br/>movement. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the complete set of<br/>transcripts, the District shall send the unit member two (2) District evaluation<br/>forms, indicating units allowed and initial salary placement. One of the<br/>forms must be signed, dated and returned within ten (10) days of receipt to<br/>the District. Earned degrees received and units of study in an accredited<br/>institution of higher learning shall be allowed for initial placement.</p>
<p>C. The accreditation status of a college, university or private school, at the</p>
<p>time of the unit member’s enrollment, shall prevail. Previous or subsequent<br/>accreditation shall not be considered. Unit members exclusive of SLPs, who<br/>resign from the District, and are subsequently reemployed, will be placed on<br/>the salary schedule in a position no higher than the sixth (6th) step,</p>
<p>(eighth (8<sup>th</sup>) step if hired on or after September 1, 1998), their previous<br/>experience notwithstanding. In addition, unit members returning to the<br/>District shall count their prior District service or service recognition. Section<br/>13 below. This is not considered salary schedule placement or rating-in.</p>
<p>However, permanent (tenured) unit members who resign and are subsequently<br/>reemployed within thirty-nine (39) calendar months from the time of<br/>resignation, shall be restored to their previous schedule status. Unit members<br/>whose initial District employment was in programs conducted under contract<br/>with public or private agencies or other categorically funded projects, and then<br/>were subsequently employed as probationary teachers with no break in<br/>service, shall be credited with the time served in the specially unded program<br/>for salary schedule placement and advancement purposes.</p>
<p>Step Movement</p>
<p>Unit members eligible for a step increase on the salary schedule shall advance only<br/>one (1) step in any one school year for each year of service.</p>
<p>5. Column Movement</p>
<p>A. Course credit for column movement shall be given for post-graduate, upper<br/>division or graduate course work taken after the B.A. at four-year colleges,<br/>universities or graduate schools which are accredited by a recognized regional<br/>accrediting commission. Semester hours (units), as defined by the particular<br/>accredited college, university or graduate school, will be acceptable for<br/>column movement. Quarter hours (units) shall be converted to semester hours<br/>(units) by multiplying the total of such hours (units) by two-thirds (2/3).<br/>Column movement shall be limited to two (2) columns per year.</p>
<p>Bilingual Inservice approved by the District shall be applicable for course<br/>credit for column movement. Fifteen (15) hours of said classes will equate to<br/>one (1) semester hour (unit). Credit for language acquisition classes will be<br/>limited to a maximum of five (5) semester units. No course credit shall be<br/>granted if a class is repeated.</p>
<p>Unit members employed prior to December 16, 1983, may apply for lower<br/>division unit credit for column movement in accordance with the provisions of<br/>Article XXVI (Salary Provisions and Schedules), Paragraph 5.D. Unit<br/>members hired or rehired after December 16, 1983, who take course credit for<br/>column movement on Salary Schedule “A” shall be governed by the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courses must be directly related to the unit member’s assignment by<br/>the District; or</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courses must be in the unit member’s academic or teaching credential<br/>major or minor; or</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courses must have prior written approval of the District.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article XXVI (Salary Provisions and Schedules), Paragraph 5.C., is<br/>also applicable to this provision.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Disputes over the applicability of course work for column movement related<br/>to Paragraph A. 1) and A. 2) of this section shall be referred to a committee of<br/>seven (7) members whose majority decision shall be final. The committee<br/>shall consist of four (4) members appointed by the Association and three (3)<br/>members appointed by the District, one (1) of whom shall be the Assistant<br/>Superintendent-Instruction, who will be chairperson.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of unit member requesting reclassification from one<br/>column to another column to provide the District with official college or<br/>university transcripts. The burden of proof of units taken shall be with the<br/>unit member. When such reclassification application has been properly<br/>submitted and official transcripts have been received and verified by the<br/>District, reclassification shall take place in the following manner:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If transcripts are received and verified within six (6) calendar months<br/>of the date in which the course work was completed, the District shall<br/>reclassify the unit member effective the first full pay period following<br/>the date on which the course work was completed.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to six (6) months retroactive pay shall be granted when transcripts<br/>are received and verified by the District within one year of completion<br/>of course work.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any error in classification shall be corrected as soon as the error is<br/>verified. Credit will not be accepted for course work taken in the<br/>armed services, except as it was taken in conjunction with an<br/>accredited college or university and can be verified through official<br/>transcripts. Course work with the prior approval of the District may be taken<br/>through a foreign university or other institution which sponsors travel tours<br/>for credits. Such courses must be assigned upper division or graduate status,<br/>assigned a course title and be given unit value. Such foreign university or<br/>other institution must be listed in the current edition of accredited institutions<br/>of higher learning or one of its regional accrediting commissions.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member believes that participation in a lower division course<br/>will be of direct benefit to the District, such unit member may petition</p>
<p>the District for a waiver. Such waiver, if granted, would allow the units so<br/>approved to be counted for advancement on the salary schedule. Prior to the<br/>date of enrollment in lower division courses, the unit member must make<br/>formal application to the District and receive approval in the form of the<br/>aforementioned waiver.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXXIII - RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS</p>
<p>A. Unit Members Hired on or Before March 31, 1986</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objective: To ensure that all Alhambra Teachers Association unit members hired on<br/>or before March 31, 1986, and who retire from the Alhambra School District with<br/>fifteen (15) years of service and are at least fifty-five (55) years of age and are<br/>eligible for retirement benefits from STRS, receive District paid medical benefits with<br/>no less benefit coverage than any plan in effect for any District employee group. The<br/>retiree unit member may elect any medical benefit plan in effect for unit members at<br/>the time of his/her retirement. Unit members between the ages of 50-55 with thirty<br/>(30) years of credited service who opt for the thirty (30) and out, standard reduction<br/>(Alternative B) under STRS, also qualify for retiree medical benefits provided that<br/>the last fifteen (15) or more years are with the Alhambra District and hired on or<br/>before March 31, 1986.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association will establish a separate budget line item entitled<br/>“ATA Retired Unit Members’ Medical Benefits Restricted Account” (hereinafter<br/>referred to as the “Account”), which shall be on deposit at the Los Angeles County<br/>Treasurer on or before October 1, 1986, for the purpose of funding ATA retiree<br/>medical benefits.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Account will be monitored by both the District and the Association. The District<br/>will provide a financial report of the Account by August 20 of the subsequent fiscal<br/>year. No funds will be removed from this Account without the express written<br/>permission of both the District and the Association, except to pay premiums for<br/>retiree medical benefits and the cost of the actuarial studies.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will conduct an actuarial study in accordance with the law, but not less<br/>often than every three years, to provide an update on the needs of the Account.</p>

<p>After each actuarial study, the District and the Association will meet to discuss the<br/>results and the recommendations of the study and to determine any course of action<br/>required.</p>
<p>Effective with the 1985-86 fiscal year, the Association’s agreed contribution to the<br/>Account shall be equivalent to a one percent (1%) salary increase on Salary Schedule<br/>“A” for those unit members on the plan October 1, 1985. Each year of this<br/>Agreement, the Association’s contribution shall be the one percent (1%) ($276,356),<br/>plus a percentage equal to the State COLA (see Salary Formula), and deposited<br/>according to the Period 1 and Period 2 State distribution of funds. This percentage<br/>shall be based on the previous year’s contribution. This one percent (1%) shall be<br/>considered the continuing contribution of the Association. The Association shall not<br/>contribute more than this one percent (1%) and its COLA. The interest on the<br/>Association’s contribution shall be compounded and shall be deposited in the<br/>Account.</p>
<p>Effective with the 1985-86 fiscal year, the District’s contribution to the Account will<br/>be equal to the District’s cost for retiree medical benefits in the year 1984-85<br/>($355,593). Each year of this Agreement the District’s contribution will be $355,593,<br/>plus a percentage equal to the State COLA (see Salary Formula), and deposited<br/>according to the Period 1 and Period 2 State distribution of funds. The interest on the<br/>District’s contribution shall be compounded and shall be deposited in the Account.</p>
<p>The District shall reimburse the Account in the amount of $272,544 over a ten (10)<br/>year period, pursuant to the reimbursement schedule.</p>
<p>In the event, during the District’s reimbursement period, there is not enough money in<br/>the Account to meet current costs, the District shall accelerate its reimbursement to<br/>meet said needs.</p>
<p>Whenever the District and the Association agree that the money in the Account is<br/>insufficient and the District has fully met the reimbursement schedule, the two parties<br/>shall agree on the amounts that each party will contribute to meet said needs. The<br/>amounts shall be on a pro rata basis, that is, 43.4% for the Association, and 56.6% for<br/>the District.</p>
<p>The spouse and/or domestic partner of the retiree may continue to participate in the<br/>plan after the death of the retiree by paying the full premium required by the District<br/>for the retirees’ rating.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Paragraphs 6., 7., and 8., above, the District and the Association<br/>agree that the District contributions to build up the fund (contributions in excess of<br/>annual premiums paid) shall be a minimum of $30,000 per year for the length of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>Unit Members Hired On or After April L 1986</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who meet the following criteria and retire from the Alhambra Unified<br/>School District shall receive District paid “bridge” medical benefits for the retiree,<br/>spouse or domestic partner, and eligible dependents, until the retiree’s eligibility for<br/>Medicare:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial hire date on or after April 1, 1986</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen (15) years of service with the Alhambra Unified School District in a<br/>position eligible for medical benefits</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least fifty-five (55) years of age</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible for retirement benefits from STRS</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members between the ages of fifty and fifty-five (50-55) with thirty (30) years of<br/>credited service who are eligible for the thirty (30) and out, standard reduction<br/>(Alternative B) under STRS, also qualify for “bridge” retiree medical benefits, until<br/>their eligibility for Medicare, provided that the last fifteen (15) or more years of<br/>service are with the Alhambra Unified School District and in a position eligible for<br/>medical benefits.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiring unit member may elect any “bridge” medical benefit plan in effect for<br/>unit members at the time of his/her retirement. The choices as of June 2, 2001 are<br/>CIGNA or Kaiser only. In subsequent years the retiree will have the option of<br/>continuing in any “bridge” benefit plan available to unit members in this eligibility<br/>period during the District’s annual Open Enrollment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spouse and/or domestic partner of the retiree may continue to participate in the<br/>“bridge” benefits program after the eligibility of the retiree ends by paying the full<br/>premium required by the District for the “bridge” benefits retiree rating until the<br/>spouse/domestic partner’s eligibility for Medicare.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall establish a specific fund to pay the costs associated with providing<br/>this “bridge” retiree medical benefit plan. This fund, and the interest it earns, shall be<br/>on deposit at the Los Angeles County Treasurer for the sole purpose of funding the<br/>“bridge” retiree medical benefits program. The resources of this fund shall be used to<br/>pay all expenditures associated with providing the “bridge” benefits program to<br/>include, but not be limited to, insurance premiums and actuarial and/or consultant<br/>fees associated with any evaluations/assessments of the fund.</p>
<p>6. In 2000-01 this fund shall be established by an initial total contribution of $250,000.</p>
<p>In years subsequent to 2000-01 the District contribution to the “bridge” benefits<br/>program shall be at the presious year’s contribution level plus the District’s annual<br/>funded COLA from the state including deficit reduction in the year in which it is<br/>applied (as illustrated below). This additional funded COLA money shall be<br/>considered as part of a total compensation package in the year in which it is applied.</p>
<p>By way of example:</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>Year 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$250,000;</p>
<p>Year 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 + District’s annual funded COLA + deficit reduction when</p>
<p>funded;</p>
<p>Year 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year 2 + District’s annual funded COLA + deficit reduction</p>
<p>when funded;</p>
<p>Year 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 + District’s annual funded COLA + deficit reduction</p>
<p>when funded;</p>
<p>And so on in subsequent years.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association shall establish a formal Health Benefits Committee.</p>
<p>This Committee shall be charged with reviewing the status of the fund for the “bridge”<br/>benefits program, along with the overall benefits afforded to the Association.

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 15, and prior to any interview process, an advisory election shall be<br/>held by the members of each affected department.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All applicants for the position shall be placed on ballots prepared by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balloting shall be at a time during the work day when all department members<br/>are able to attend. The time and place of balloting shall be determined by the<br/>principal, who shall notify all department members at least five (5) days in<br/>advance.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 1 of each year, the ATA shall select one representative from each site<br/>to work with the principal to coordinate the advisory election process.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advisory election shall be conducted by a department member or<br/>members selected by the department. This designee shall collect ballots from<br/>the principal, conduct the election, seal the ballots, and deliver them to the<br/>principal’s office immediately following the election</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ballots shall be counted by the principal or designee and the ATA<br/>designee. Sealed ballots may be held until a time mutually agreeable to both<br/>parties within two (2) days after the close of elections.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process will be modified as follows: (When an individual receives<br/>a minimum of 2/3 of the vote for Department Head and is not placed in<br/>the position, he/she may appeal to a committee for review. The committee<br/>will be a panel of two, one representing ATA and one district level<br/>administrator. If the panel can not make a decision then the final decision will<br/>be made by the Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services.)</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of the advisory elections shall be delivered to the Superintendent by<br/>May 20 of each year.</p>
