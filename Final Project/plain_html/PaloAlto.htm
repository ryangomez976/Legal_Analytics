<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Facilities</p>
<p>All Association business, discussions, and activities shall be conducted by unit members or<br/>Association officials outside established work hours as defined in Article VII herein, and shall be<br/>conducted in places other than District property except when an authorized Association representative<br/>obtains advance permission from the Superintendent or designee regarding the specific time, place, and<br/>type of activity to be conducted. Permission shall be granted if the Superintendent or designee can<br/>verify that such activities and use of facilities will not interfere with the school programs and/or duties<br/>of employees, and will not directly or indirectly interfere with the right of employees to refrain from<br/>listening to or speaking with an Association representative.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Communications</p>
<p>The Association shall be entitled to the use of and access to employee mailboxes for<br/>communications to unit members regarding matters which involve the Association. The Association<br/>shall also be entitled to post notices of Association concern on bulletin boards designated for<br/>exclusive use by the Association, at least one of which shall be provided in each school building, in<br/>areas frequented by employees.</p>
<p>All postings for bulletin boards or items for school mailboxes shall contain the date of posting or<br/>distribution and the identification of the Association. A copy of such postings or distributions shall<br/>be provided to the Superintendent or designee at the time of posting or distribution.</p>
<p>The Association shall make every effort not to post or to distribute information, which is derogatory<br/>or defamatory of the District or its personnel. When the District deems material to be derogatory or<br/>defamatory, the site administrator shall notify the Association representative who shall remove the<br/>material for referral to the Superintendent and the Association President or their designees. After the<br/>two officials have had a reasonable opportunity to discuss the challenged material, the material may<br/>be posted again at the Association’s discretion.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Meetings</p>
<p>The District administration will not schedule meetings outside regular school hours on Thursdays.<br/>The Association will not schedule regular Association meetings on workdays other than Thursdays.</p>

The<br/>District Administration will then identify twelve (12) non-Association Thursdays for non¬<br/>mandatory District or Site organized events, activities, or meetings. Upon ratification of this<br/>agreement the twelve (12) days will be prorated to eight (8) for the ’07-’08 school year. The<br/>Association and the District will collaborate on the use of the non-scheduled Thursdays. The<br/>District Administration or the Association may request a waiver from the other party in order to<br/>hold a meeting on a non-scheduled Thursday. The district may schedule Back-to-School Nights<br/>on any Thursday and BTSA meetings on any non-Association Thursday. The provisions of this<br/>section (C.l.) shall expire on June 15th 2009. The parties shall meet to negotiate regarding this<br/>section no later than May 1, 2009.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Information</p>
<p>The District shall provide the Association with names and building assignments of the bargaining<br/>unit members, without cost to the Association, no later than September 30 of each school year.

<p>- 5 -</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Released Time</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall exclusively receive time off from duties for the processing of grievances<br/>past Level I of the grievance procedure. Article V herein, for Association members who are<br/>designated as Association representatives, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four (24) hours prior to release from duties for grievance processing, a designated<br/>representative shall inform the immediate supervisor in order that an adequate substitute may<br/>be obtained, if such is necessary; and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such time off shall be limited solely to representing a Grievant in a conference with<br/>management person beyond Level I, and in no way shall this limitation include use of such<br/>time for matters such as gathering information, interviewing witnesses, or preparing a<br/>presentation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, released time for Association business will be provided according to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may designate representatives who shall be entitled to a total of ten (10)<br/>days or its equivalent of released time per school year for conducting business pertinent to<br/>the Association. The Association is entitled to an additional 5 days for this purpose, for<br/>which it will pay to the District substitute costs.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may designate six (6) members to their bargaining team who shall be<br/>entitled to a reasonable amount of time for the purpose of negotiating with the Board and/or<br/>its designated representatives.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall grant paid leave, exclusive of all other paid or unpaid leave, to the<br/>President of the Association for two-fifths (2/5) time during the school year. The duty to<br/>defend under Government Code Section 810, et seq., will apply during that portion of the<br/>assignment when the President is working under the direction of the District.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide the President of the Association an additional one-fifth (1/5) time<br/>leave of absence while serving as the President, according to the provisions and benefits of<br/>Education Code Section 22711 and 44987, and subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association will reimburse the District, on an agreed upon schedule, for one-fifth<br/>(1/5) of the costs of the President’s salary, retirement, benefits, and salary related costs.<br/>Failure to provide this reimbursement in a timely fashion will be grounds for the<br/>immediate termination of the leave.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiating parties agree to reopen this item for negotiations on the successor<br/>agreement. Such re-opener negotiations shall be initiated no later than May 1, 2009. If the<br/>parties are unable to reach agreement on a new provision, the leave accorded the President<br/>in subsection “c” above shall constitute the status quo ante for purposes of negotiations<br/>under the EERA. The status quo ante, according to section “E.2.c” above, requires the<br/>district to grant paid leave to the President of the Association for one-fifth (1/5) time during<br/>the school year.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agency Fee and Dues Deduction</p>
<p>1. Employee Rights</p>
<p>The District and PAEA/CTA/NEA recognize the right of employees to form, join, and<br/>participate in lawful activities of employee organizations and the equal, alternative right of<br/>employees to refuse to form, join, and participate in employee organizations. Neither party shall<br/>exert pressure upon nor discriminate against an employee in the exercise of these alternative<br/>rights. Accordingly, membership in the Association shall not be compulsory.</p>
<p>A unit member has the right to choose: to become a member of the Association, or to pay to the<br/>Association a fee for representation services, or to refrain from either of the above courses of<br/>action upon the grounds set forth in Section 6 below.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll Deductions</p>
<p>The District shall deduct from the pay of Association members and pay to the Association the<br/>normal and regular monthly Association membership dues as voluntarily authorized in writing<br/>by the employee on the District form, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such deduction shall be made only upon submission of the District form to the designated<br/>representative of the District. Said form shall be duly completed and executed by the<br/>employee and an authorized representative of the Association.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing administrative procedures regarding other legally authorized voluntary deductions<br/>shall be maintained. The Certificated Human Resources Office shall supply each unit<br/>member with information regarding all insurance programs and a list of items that have been<br/>approved for payment deductions. For those receiving ten warrants, double deductions shall<br/>be taken in May and June for dependent health, dental, and voluntary life insurance<br/>premiums. Such authorization may be invoked or revoked in writing by the unit member at<br/>any time.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed or discontinued<br/>deduction until the pay period commencing fifteen (15) days or longer after such submission.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Categories of Employees Excluded from Coverage</p>
<p>This agency fee provision shall apply to all members of the bargaining unit except for all hourly<br/>adult-education teachers and all part-time employees on less than a fifty-percent assignment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Method and Association Certification Requirements</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who is not excluded in Section 3 or not exempted in Section 6, and<br/>who has not voluntarily made application for membership in the Association within the<br/>thirtieth (30th) day following the date upon which said employee has been formally hired by<br/>the District as a bargaining unit employee, must as a condition of continued employment in the<br/>District pay to the Association a service fee. This fee is in exchange for representation services<br/>necessarily performed by the Association in conformance with its legally imposed duty of fair<br/>representation on behalf of said unit member who is not a member of the Association.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member does not become a member of the Association or pay such<br/>fee directly to the Association, the District shall begin automatic payroll deduction as<br/>provided by the Education Code.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to beginning such automatic payroll deduction, the Association will certify to the<br/>District in writing that:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee whose pay is to be affected by the deduction has:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused to join the Association;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refused to tender the amount of the service fee as defined herein; and</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not applied for an exemption under Section 6 herein; and</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association is complying with current Public Employment Relations Board<br/>Regulations regarding “Notification of Non-member,” “Filing of Financial Reports,”<br/>“Agency Fee Appeal,” “Escrow of Agency Fees in Dispute,” and “Filing of Agency Fee<br/>Appeal Procedure.”</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written certification in “(c)” above, shall be a condition precedent to any collection of<br/>the service fee by the District.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request the Association will provide in a timely manner the District a copy of the<br/>written notice required by the regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board to be<br/>sent to non-Association members subject to the service fee.</p>
<p>- 7 -</p>
<p>f. Minimum Requirements for Automatic Payroll Deduction of Fee</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is under no obligation to make payroll deductions for periods during which a<br/>unit member is either terminated from active employment or not on the District’s active<br/>payroll for any reason, including, but not limited to, layoff and voluntary leave of<br/>absence for more than thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member’s earnings must be sufficient after other legal and required deductions<br/>are made to cover the amount of the dues or service fees to be deducted.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is in a non-pay status for an entire pay period, no withholding will<br/>be made to cover the pay period. In the case of a unit member who is in a non-pay status<br/>during only part of the pay period, and the salary is not sufficient to cover the full<br/>withholding, no deduction shall be made. All other legal and required deductions have<br/>priority over Association dues and service fees.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of Fee</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of fee collected from bargaining unit members shall be that allowed by Section<br/>3540.1(i)(2) of the Government Code.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Unit members hired during the school year shall join the Association or pay a prorated</p>
<p>service fee.</p>
<p>(2) Unit members on leave without pay, and unit members who are on laid-off status shall be<br/>exempt from these provisions herein; except that the election as to membership or<br/>payment of a fee as set forth herein must be exercised within the first ten (10) work days<br/>upon return to paid status.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute as to the amount of the service fee shall be resolved pursuant to the current<br/>regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Exemptions from Obligation to Pay Service Fee</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member shall be exempted from the requirements of a service fee if such unit<br/>member is a member of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which has historically held<br/>conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting a “public employee<br/>organization” as defined by Section 3540.1(d) of the Government Code. In addition any unit<br/>member may be exempted from the service fee if such unit member registers a deep<br/>philosophical objection to financially supporting a “public employee organization.”</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To validly register such exemption, the unit member must submit by registered mail the<br/>statement of deep philosophical objection to both the Association and the District<br/>Certificated Human Resources Office. The registration must be made by September 30 of<br/>each school year, or within thirty (30) days of employment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such exempt unit member shall, as an alternative to payment of a service fee to the<br/>Association, pay an amount equivalent to such service fee to:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way, CHAD, or</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palo Alto Foundation for Education, or</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any charity or educational foundation jointly agreed upon by the District and the<br/>Association which is exempt from taxation under the Internal Revenue Code and is not<br/>affiliated in any manner with the Association, and is not related to an established religious<br/>organization.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of the Association, an employee who has validly registered an exemption will<br/>be required to show proof of contribution to a charity under subsection “c” above by means<br/>of canceled check or other reasonable proof.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Service Fee Payers</p>
<p>During the term of this Agreement, any employee who pays an agency fee, in addition to the</p>
<p>rights accorded by law, shall have the right to identify issues for the negotiations process.</p>
<p>- 8 -</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District’s Obligation</p>
<p>The District’s obligations under this Article are 1) to notify any unit member who has failed to<br/>comply with the provisions of this section that, as a condition of employment in the District, such<br/>unit member must either become an Association member, pay a service fee, or establish an<br/>exempt status and make payment pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; and 2) deduct<br/>from pay appropriate amounts pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 herein. Under no circumstances shall<br/>the District be required to dismiss or otherwise discipline any unit member for failure to fulfill<br/>their obligations to pay the fees established herein.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold Harmless and Indemnity Provision</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, as defined by this Agreement, shall hold the District harmless and shall<br/>fully and promptly reimburse the District for reasonable legal fees and costs incurred in<br/>responding to or defending against any claims, disputes, or challenges, which are actually<br/>brought against the District or any of its agents by other than the Association in connection<br/>with the administration or enforcement of any section of this agreement pertaining to<br/>representation fee. Such reimbursement shall include costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon notice that the District is going to seek indemnification or to be held harmless under<br/>this provision, the Association shall have the right to meet with the District regarding the<br/>reasonableness and merit of any claim, demand, suit, or action for which the District seeks<br/>indemnification, and shall attempt to agree whether any such action listed above in “(a)”<br/>shall be compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether or not such action shall be compromised, resisted, defended, tried or<br/>appealed, the District will defer to the Association’s interest if the District does not have a<br/>distinct and separate legal interest in the matter in dispute.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for any fees, costs, charges, or penalties for<br/>which the Association was not properly notified and provided the opportunity to discuss as<br/>set forth herein; nor will the District be entitled to any such reimbursements when the<br/>District’s efforts in defending against such action would be duplicative, or when the District<br/>is defending a separate and distinct legal interest or when the District is defending an activity<br/>which is arguably subject to criminal liability on the part of any District administrator.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expiration Date of Agency Fee Provisions</p>
<p>It is agreed by the parties to this Agreement that the provisions, rights, and obligations herein<br/>pertaining to an agency fee shall not survive beyond, and shall accordingly expire with the term<br/>of the current contract.</p>
<p>G. Consulting Procedures</p>
<p>The Association and District have developed Consulting Procedures. These Procedures (adopted in<br/>July 1977) are included in Chapter VII of the Board Policy and Procedure Manual, which is<br/>available at each school site. Consulting Procedures are not subject to the grievance process<br/>contained in Article V of this contract.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an agreement is reached, the agreement shall be written and shall be signed by all the<br/>parties to the mediation. All settlement agreements shall be non-precedential and shall<br/>constitute only a settlement of the particular grievance.</p>

Such awards<br/>are specifically reviewable by the Superior Court pursuant to the processes and procedures<br/>set forth under the California Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>D. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the District or the Association against any participant<br/>in the grievance procedures.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All grievances shall be treated as confidential matters and as such only persons who are<br/>necessary to the processing of the grievance or to the adjustment of the grievance or necessarily<br/>involved in the investigation of the grievance shall have access to information concerning the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall deprive any unit member of any legal right that he presently has.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any expenses incurred shall be borne by the parties incurring them, except as provided for in<br/>Level V.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who is requested to appear in such conferences or hearings as a witness during<br/>working hours shall be accorded release time, but not the cost of a substitute. Witnesses shall be<br/>informed that their testimony shall be kept confidential unless they choose to make it public.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be<br/>filed in a separate grievance file and shall not be kept in the personnel file of any of the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the employer nor the Association shall be permitted to assert any grounds or evidence<br/>before the arbitrator that was not previously disclosed to the other party. The arbitrator shall</p>
<p>consider only those issues that have been carried through prior steps as required by the<br/>provisions of the procedure.</p>
<p>The Superintendent, or his designee, and the Association agree to make available to both parties<br/>all pertinent information, not privileged under law or employer policies, in their possession or<br/>control and which is relevant to the issues raised by the grievance.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association and the Superintendent, or the Superintendent’s designee, agree in writing, the<br/>grievance may be brought directly to any higher level of the grievance procedure. Time limits<br/>may be shortened or extended.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance may be withdrawn at any level without establishing precedent.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision rendered at any level shall be considered final unless an appeal is registered within<br/>the limit specified. If a decision is not given to the aggrieved party within the time limit, an<br/>appeal may be taken to the next level.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in these grievance procedures is meant to deny to either the Association or to the<br/>District the right to complain directly to the other, at whatever level seems appropriate, about the<br/>handling of issues that appear elsewhere in this contract other than in the articles on Association<br/>Rights or District Rights. Such discussions shall not be matters of formal grievance procedures<br/>unless both parties agree that formal grievance procedures should be entered into as a possible<br/>way of avoiding a contest over unfair labor practices with the Public Employment Relations<br/>Board.</p>

<p>Absent any written subsequent agreement to the contrary, the District’s obligation on and after<br/>January 1, 2015, to contribute towards health benefits shall not exceed the product of $13,070<br/>multiplied by the number of employees in the bargaining unit divided by twelve (12) equal<br/>monthly payments. The dollar amount specified in this section sets no precedent regarding the</p>
<p>District’s obligation to provide benefits at any particular plan level in future years. However,<br/>the District’s obligation to pay premium costs at the January 1 to December 31, 2014 level shall<br/>continue until a subsequent agreement regarding health and welfare benefits is reached or until<br/>the automatically applied $280,000 below is expended, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>Beginning January 1, 2014, the District will automatically contribute $280,000 to defray any<br/>increased cost of benefits for the 2014 benefit year above the District’s contribution of the<br/>product of $13,070 multiplied by the number of eligible employees in the bargaining unit as<br/>outlined in this section.</p>
<p>From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014, employees who elect for the Anthem Blue<br/>Cross PPO plan shall pay through monthly payroll deductions in advance of the month of<br/>coverage the difference in the District contribution toward the cost of the Anthem Blue Cross<br/>HMO and the corresponding cost of the Anthem Blue Cross PPO plan.</p>
<p>For eligible employees whose first date of paid service is on or after January 1, 2010, the<br/>District shall provide dental insurance coverage under a PPO dental plan. Eligible employees<br/>whose first date of paid service is before January 1, 2010, the District shall provide eligible<br/>employees with a choice of dental plans—the current incentive dental plan or the PPO dental<br/>plan under which employees hired on or after January 1, 2010 are covered. Employees who<br/>have the option of selecting dental coverage and who select the PPO dental plan shall not be<br/>eligible to return to the current incentive plan. Eligible employees whose first date of paid<br/>service is before January 1, 2010, and who resign or are laid off and are subsequently rehired<br/>within thirty-nine months shall be provided only the PPO dental plan.</p>
<p>The District will provide coverage to domestic partners of unit members, provided the<br/>definition of domestic partnership meets all the criteria of Section 297 of the California<br/>Family Code, and provided further that the unit member presents the District with proof that<br/>a valid declaration of domestic partnership has been filed pursuant to the above Family Code<br/>section or with any local agency registering domestic partnerships. At any time during this<br/>agreement, the carriers and the benefits specifications may be changed through negotiations<br/>if the parties mutually agree.</p>
<p>c. Joint Benefits Committee</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will form a Joint Employee-Employer Benefits Committee, comprised of<br/>four (4) appointees each of the Association, the District, and CSEA and one (1) appointee<br/>from PAMA.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Committee will be to consider and make recommendations to the<br/>negotiating teams regarding matters related to medical, dental, and vision benefits,<br/>including the following:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explore alternative indemnity carriers and/or modification of current indemnity<br/>benefit specifications;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recommend employment of the necessary professional advice regarding medical,<br/>dental and vision programs; and</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To review and make recommendations on any cost savings or cost containment<br/>measures, including brokerage/sales fees, pre- and post- admissions review,<br/>contracting with local hospitals, and utilization review.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective parties will make their appointments annually by April 15 of each year.<br/>The first meeting will be scheduled by the District Human Resources Office; thereafter</p>
<p>meetings will be scheduled by consensus of the Committee. Released time will be<br/>provided for the committee members.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person shall be covered under more than one plan contributed to by the District. An<br/>employee with a spouse or partner who is also employed by the District would be covered in<br/>the following manner:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dependents: (a) each may be covered under employee only coverage or (b) one<br/>employee-plus-one coverage policy.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or more dependents: (a) one employee-plus-family coverage policy.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee contributions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married or registered partners, both benefit eligible and</p>
<p>employed by the District may be eligible for an additional District contribution toward<br/>the employee contribution for health benefits in the Kaiser or Anthem HMO employee-<br/>plus-one and the Kaiser or Anthem HMO employee-plus-family medical coverage<br/>policies. Adding the FTE of the couple and multiplying the portion over 1.0 FTE by the<br/>District’s monthly contribution for the Kaiser or Anthem HMO employee-only policy<br/>shall determine the amount of the additional District contribution toward the employee<br/>contribution. If this product equals or exceeds the employee monthly contribution for the<br/>chosen Kaiser or Anthem HMO policy ($120 for the Kaiser employee-plus-one policy or<br/>$170 for Kaiser employee-plus-family policy or $135 for Anthem HMO employee-plus-<br/>one policy or $180 for Anthem HMO employee-plus-family policy) then the couple will<br/>not be required to pay the employee contribution. If this product does not equal or<br/>exceed the employee contribution for the chosen HMO policy then the couple will pay<br/>the difference as a monthly payroll deduction. Married or registered partners, where both<br/>are benefit eligible part-time employees, may combine their FTE to qualify for the full¬<br/>time District contribution toward an employee-plus-one or employee-plus-family policy<br/>without having the District’s contribution prorated.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees eligible for full-time medical coverage who provide proof of comparable medical<br/>coverage through a non-District spouse or legal partner may chose to decline District medical<br/>coverage and receive $2500 in ten (10) equal payments for a full-year of non-coverage.<br/>Employees who have declined medical benefits and received the non-coverage payment may<br/>reenroll in a medical plan during open enrollment or if a qualifying event occurs. It is within<br/>the sole discretion of the District to continue this provision for each successive year of this<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees eligible for full-time dental coverage who provide proof of comparable dental<br/>coverage through a non-District spouse or legal partner may choose to decline District dental<br/>benefits and receive $300 in ten (10) equal payments for a full year of non-coverage.<br/>Employees who have declined dental benefits and received a non-coverage payment may<br/>reenroll in the Delta Dental PPO plan during open enrollment or if a qualifying event occurs.<br/>It is within the sole discretion of the District to continue this provision for each successive<br/>year of this agreement.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part Time Employees</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees must work one-half (.5) of a full time equivalent (FTE) position or more to be<br/>eligible for health, dental, vision and life insurance coverage.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employees regularly assigned at least .5 FTE but less than 1.0 FTE, the District’s<br/>contribution for health insurance benefits (medical, dental, vision and life) shall be<br/>prorated based upon a full time assignment. If the employee elects to participate in the<br/>District’s health plans, the part time employee shall pay the balance of the premium cost<br/>through monthly payroll deductions in advance of the month of coverage.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer school employment shall not be considered for purposes of eligibility for health<br/>and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>- 18 -</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Advancement</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Advancement</p>
<p>Unit members (including those members with part-time assignments) who work at least seventy-<br/>five percent (75%) of the days required for their assignment shall have that year count as a year<br/>of experience for salary purposes and shall move one step on the certificated employee salary<br/>schedule. Unit members (including those members with part-time assignments) whose<br/>assignments do not span the length of a full school year shall not be eligible to move one step on<br/>the salary schedule. The District shall use both days worked and personally accumulated sick<br/>leave used during the year to calculate the number of days of service for a given school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column Advancement</p>
<p>“Plan for Salary Advancement” is incorporated into this Agreement by reference as Appendix B<br/>and shall be subject to the grievance procedure, except for the section “Salary Advancement<br/>Categories.”</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Payments</p>
<p>The procedures in effect January 17, 1978, as outlined in Section 6 of Policy VI-E, “Compensation<br/>and Related Benefits” of the Board Policy and Procedure Manual, shall be maintained for the<br/>duration of the contract.

<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Learning Stipend (PL Stipend)</p>
<p>The District is committed to fostering a culture of on-going professional learning in PAUSD in order<br/>to create an environment in which every staff member is actively engaged in professional learning<br/>that enhances their ability to improve the experience and education of our students. Unit members<br/>and administrators will jointly identify and provide quality professional learning opportunities<br/>focused on student learning.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall form a committee with teacher representation to assist in identifying eligible<br/>professional learning activities and in evaluating the effectiveness of the activities. The<br/>Professional Learning Committee will consist of three (3) unit members appointed by the<br/>Association and three (3) members appointed by the District. The committee shall be<br/>responsible for:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisting in the identification of eligible professional learning activities</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisting in the communication with unit members of those activities that qualify for the PL<br/>Stipend.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing feedback on the effectiveness of professional learning activities offered by the<br/>school sites and District during staff development days</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will earn the PL Stipend by engaging in 18 hours of eligible professional learning<br/>activities outside the professional workday and beyond those activities provided during<br/>designated staff development days.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PL Stipend will be paid at the rate published in Appendix H.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have their proposed professional learning activities pre-approved by their<br/>site principal using district-supplied forms. If a proposed activity is denied by the principal, the<br/>unit member may appeal the decision to the Associate Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In extenuating circumstances, the Superintendent or Superintendent’s designee may grant a unit<br/>member an extension beyond the two-year time frame to complete the 18 hours of professional<br/>learning.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members approved by their sites for professional learning hours beyond the 18 hours<br/>needed for the PL Stipend will be paid at the hourly professional learning rate in Appendix H.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional learning hours used for the PL Stipend may not be used for units to move columns<br/>on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the sole discretion to discontinue the PL Stipend program (stipend and<br/>expectation of 18 hours of professional learning every two years) for any school year beyond<br/>2015-16.</p>

<p>A transfer is a movement of a unit member to a different level (elementary, middle, high, or<br/>alternative program) or site. Transfers are seen as a means to facilitate and support professional<br/>growth or to meet specific individual, site, or district needs. A transfer may be initiated by a unit<br/>member, his/her principal or supervisor, or the Superintendent or his/her designee. The District shall<br/>attempt to make transfers on a mutually satisfactory basis among unit members. Teachers shall be<br/>assigned to teach within the authorizations of their teaching credentials and, to the extent possible,<br/>within their major or minor fields of study.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information on Teacher Needs</p>
<p>Early in February of each year, information shall be requested from unit members regarding their<br/>plans for the ensuing school year. Results of this survey provide preliminary information on<br/>personnel needs for the fall semester.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies</p>
<p>A current list of vacancies shall be posted on the PAUSD staff web site with known information<br/>about the grade level/subject and school site of the vacancies.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers Initiated by Unit Member</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadline for self-initiated transfer requests for the following school year is March 31.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are encouraged to apply for self-initiated transfers after a number of years at the<br/>same site. If a unit member desires a transfer, the unit member shall submit a transfer request,<br/>using the District form, to his/her principal, department head, or the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee. It is desirable, but not necessary, for a unit member to discuss interest in a transfer<br/>with his/her supervisor. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall acknowledge receipt of<br/>transfer requests within five days of receipt; and unless special arrangements are made, shall<br/>notify the supervisor when the written transfer request is received.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Office shall notify unit members, who have informed Human Resources<br/>of an interest in transferring to other certificated positions in the district, of vacancies as they<br/>become known. Unit members are encouraged to check the PAUSD staff website regularly for<br/>the most up-to-date vacancy information.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer requests from permanent employees for positions for which they are credentialed and<br/>qualified are assured consideration before requests from temporary or probationary employees.<br/>When an opening occurs, the receiving principal or other responsible administrator shall screen<br/>those requesting transfer to his/her building or department and interview those deemed most<br/>qualified. The interviewer shall notify the individual selected, as well as those interviewed, of<br/>the final decision as soon as possible.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who initiates a request for transfer need not accept a position/assignment offered,<br/>but may remain in his/her present role.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a unique vacancy occurs after March 31, then the deadline is extended to 5 school<br/>days after the vacancy is posted.</p>
<p>7. In the event a grade-level assignment change occurs after March 31, the deadline for self-<br/>initiated transfer requests is extended to 5 school days after the assignment change is<br/>communicated to the unit member.</p>
<p>- 24 -</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers Initiated by Principals, Supervisors, or District Administration</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central administration or a site principal or supervisor may initiate teacher transfers in order<br/>to meet the staffing needs of the District or site.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staffing needs of the District or site that may be considered when initiating transfers include, but<br/>are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special qualifications;</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level of experience and expertise; and</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff collaboration and teamwork.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before an administrative transfer is initiated, each person affected by the proposed transfer shall<br/>participate in a conference with the principal and the administrator of Human Resources. The<br/>parties will discuss the issues giving rise to the transfer, explore possible options to resolve the<br/>issue other than a transfer, and seek mutual agreement on a resolution. If an administrative<br/>transfer is initiated, the District will provide a written response as to the reasons for the transfer.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative transfers will not be made for disciplinary purposes.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering administrative transfers, every effort shall be made to place a unit member who<br/>meets the Teaching Standards defined in Article X in an appropriate assignment, as perceived by<br/>the unit member and his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When considering involuntary staff transfers, if an employee has signed a formal agreement with<br/>the District to retire at the end of the next school year, the District administration shall make a<br/>good faith effort to keep the employee at the same school site during the last year of<br/>employment.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers Resulting from School Closure or District Reorganization</p>
<p>A committee consisting of four (4) representatives each from the Association and the District shall<br/>meet to review transfer procedures if or when school closure or District reorganization occurs.</p>

<p>* Class size reductions supported by State or local funding</p>
<p>B. Class Size Reduction</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size Reduction Based on State and Local Funding</p>
<p>The class size reduction ratios listed in Section A are contingent on continued State and local<br/>funding. If the State or local funding ceases or is reduced below the 2002 funding levels, the<br/>Board may reinstate, in Section A, the appropriate ratios list in Section B.2 that existed before<br/>the implementation of State and Local class size reductions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratios prior to Class Size Reduction per Section A</p>
<p>K..............................................One &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students</p>
<p>Grades 1-5...............................One teacher per 27.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students</p>
<p>Grades 6-12.............................One teacher per 28.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students</p>
<p>C. Remediation Measures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the daily enrollment in a K-5 class exceeds the class size ratio listed in Section A, the<br/>remediation measures of Section C.3 will apply. This remediation will be paid quarterly and will<br/>be calculated on the fifteenth day of each quarter. Remediation funds, per student over the<br/>appropriate class size ratio, shall be determined by dividing the first cell of the salary schedule<br/>by the class size ratio for K-l in Section A. Except for this provision, any enforcement of the K-3<br/>standards or any penalties or other remedies will be only through the appropriate State rules and<br/>regulations.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the class size staffing ratios for grades 6 through 12 within a school exceeds the above listed<br/>averages on the fifteenth day of the school year and/or the beginning of the second semester, the<br/>remediation measures described in Section C.3 below will apply.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When remediation measures apply, the first consideration for the use of the remediation funds<br/>shall be to reduce the impact of the larger class size. The principal and staff members involved<br/>shall explore and mutually discuss the following methods for remediation, and thereafter the<br/>principal shall select from the following options:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide assistance</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional aide time or additional classroom support FTE</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of pupils.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring of additional teacher(s).</p>
<p>- 26 -</p>
<p>e. If after discussion, none of the above options are feasible, the principal and staff members<br/>involved will present a remediation plan for equivalent funds in lieu of personnel to the<br/>Superintendent or designee for approval.</p>
<p>In the case of remediation in grades 6 through 12, the principal will present the remediation plan<br/>to the staff by the twenty-first day of the semester or school year, whichever is appropriate. In<br/>the case of remediation in grades K- 5, the plan will be presented within 10 school days of the<br/>date on which the criteria for remediation are met.</p>
<p>4. The District shall provide the Association with the class size school average statistics as of the<br/>eleventh day of the school year, or thereafter on request. The Association’s building site<br/>representative may participate in the remediation discussion.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All temporary and probationary staff members will follow the chronology given for Plan 1,<br/>which involves formal evaluation every year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All permanent staff members with fewer than ten years experience in the District unless<br/>requesting Plan 2.2 Peer (two-year cycle), shall follow Plan 2.2, having a formal evaluation<br/>(written summary evaluation) every other year except when:</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Chronology by itself does not give a complete picture of the evaluation process. It must be<br/>looked at in conjunction with the responsibilities listed on the previous pages. Further, the<br/>establishment of the following target dates is not meant to ignore the importance of ongoing<br/>informal meetings between the supervisor and the staff member Such meetings are an important<br/>part of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target dates listed in these tables are dates by when the procedures are expected to be</p>
<p>accomplished, although exceptions may be made. If procedures are not accomplished within two<br/>weeks after the target dates listed, some final judgments about the staff member’s performance<br/>that year may be impossible or inappropriate. 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the informal evaluation year,</p>
<p>staff members will be expected to review and revise their professional development plans, and<br/>may use a variety of methods for assessing progress on their professional development plans,<br/>including self-evaluation. Informal meetings with supervisors are encouraged.</p>
<p>Plan 1 — Chronology</p>
<p>This plan applies to all temporary and probationary staff members and their supervisors. Formal<br/>evaluation occurs every year.</p>
<p>A staff member who is employed more than 40% and who is temporary for a third consecutive year will<br/>follow the chronology for a temporary staff member who is equal to or less than 40%.</p>

<p>H. Evaluation Plan 3: Does Not Meet Standards: Support/ Improvement Plan Implemented</p>
<p>1. Placement on Plan 3 is the result of a staff member’s failing to meet one or more of the<br/>Standards as identified by the site principal and administrative supervisor working in<br/>consultation with the Superintendent’s staff. While placement on Evaluation Plan 3 may occur</p>
<p>during the spring reviews, a staff member shall be placed on this plan whenever it is deemed<br/>necessary by the site principal/administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to a teacher’s being formally assigned to Plan 3, the following procedures will be followed:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the site principal/administrator determines that a teacher’s performance does not meet all<br/>the Standards, s/he and the teacher will develop a plan to address concerns over an informal<br/>support period of 4 to 8 weeks. The principal/administrator shall notify a PAEA<br/>representative chosen by the teacher and a Human Resources administrator of the discussion.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the agreed-upon informal support period, if the teacher’s performance does not<br/>meet standards, the principal/administrator shall notify the teacher in writing that s/he is<br/>being placed on Evaluation Plan 3.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher has previously been given the opportunity to address performance concerns<br/>through this type of informal support period, it is the prerogative of the<br/>principal/administrator to assign the teacher directly to Plan 3 should the same or other<br/>concerns surface at a later date.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the principal/administrator may request any assistance or resources that she/he deems<br/>appropriate, the responsibility for monitoring and supervising staff placed on Evaluation Plan 3<br/>is the responsibility of the principal/administrator as identified at the beginning of the school<br/>year.</p>
<p>I. Procedures for Evaluation Plan 3</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All general procedures for the staff member and the supervisor listed in in Section G (Chronology)<br/>for Plans 1, 2.2, 2.2 Peer, 2.4, and 2.4 Peer are required here. In the case of conflict between those<br/>general procedures and these specific procedures, these specific procedures apply.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff member placed on Evaluation Plan 3 shall be notified of this by both the<br/>principal/administrator and a Human Resources administrator.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the staff member has been placed on Plan 3, the teacher, the principal, the administrative<br/>supervisor(s), a Human Resources administrator, and at the staff member’s request, a PAEA<br/>representative of the staff member’s choice will develop a support/improvement plan, which<br/>shall specify:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time span of the plan, not to exceed 18 weeks</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance concerns, including the Standards to be addressed</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support to be provided to the staff member, including referral to the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Program</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Process and schedule for gathering parent/student input, if deemed by the supervisor to be a<br/>necessary part of the plan</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about classroom observations to be made, which may be announced or<br/>unannounced</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of what will be considered satisfactory progress toward meeting Standards, to be<br/>used in consideration of an extension of the support period (see “5(b)” following) and</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dates of written progress reports and summary evaluation</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every 6 weeks the supervisor shall complete a written report on the staff member’s<br/>progress and discuss it with the staff member. Each report will clearly identify which standards<br/>remain to be met.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the period specified in the support/improvement plan the principal/administrator<br/>will write a summary evaluation of the staff member’s performance.</p>
<p>a. If the principal/administrator, in consultation with the supervisor/evaluator, determines that the<br/>staff member meets all Standards, s/he will be placed on Evaluation Plan 2.2 and will receive a</p>
<p>summary evaluation in the following school year. Thereafter, the staff member may select to<br/>be evaluated under any Plan appropriate to the staff member’s experience in the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principal/administrator, in consultation with the supervisor/evaluator, determines that a<br/>staff member has made satisfactory progress but still does not meet all standards, an<br/>extension of Plan 3 may be granted for up to 18 weeks. A definition of what will be<br/>considered satisfactory progress will be included in the original support/improvement plan.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principal/administrator, in consultation with the supervisor, determines that a staff<br/>member has not made satisfactory progress toward meeting all standards, the staff member<br/>will be placed on Evaluation Plan 4.</p>
<p>6. The support/improvement plan and summary evaluation required under Plan 3 will be placed in<br/>the staff member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>J. Evaluation Plan 4: Does Not Meet Standards: Administrative Review</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff member not meeting one or more of the Standards and not making satisfactory<br/>improvement during a period of support in Plan 3 shall be evaluated under Plan 4. Evaluations<br/>of staff members under Plan 4 are structured to accumulate a file that demonstrates the quality of<br/>the staff member’s performance and the efforts expended in assisting the staff member to<br/>improve performance. Evaluation Plan 4 requires careful monitoring and analysis of the staff<br/>member’s performance. The District may begin termination procedures for unsatisfactory<br/>performance pursuant to the Education Code at any time while the teacher is being evaluated<br/>under Plan 4.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent’s staff, in consultation with site principals and other administrative personnel,<br/>shall identify individuals to be placed under Evaluation Plan 4. The staff member shall be notified<br/>of this decision at a meeting with the principal/administrator and a member of the Superintendent’s<br/>staff, in order to delineate clearly concerns associated with the staff member’s performance.</p>
<p>a. Procedures for Evaluation Plan 4</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School and District administrators shall revise the staff member’s support/improvement<br/>plan (created in Plan 3) to include more frequent observations and conferences and more<br/>direct intervention in the classroom. The maximum duration of this support/improvement<br/>plan will be 9 weeks.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every 2 weeks the principal/administrator shall complete a written report on the<br/>staff member’s progress and discuss this report with the teacher.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal/administrator shall write a summary evaluation by a date specified in the<br/>support/improvement plan, but no later than 9 weeks after the time the staff member is<br/>placed on Plan 4. This evaluation will be reviewed by the Superintendent’s staff.</p>
<p>(a) If the principal/administrator and Superintendent’s staff determine that the staff<br/>member meets all standards at the end of the support period, the staff member will be<br/>evaluated by Plan 2.2 for the remainder of that school year and the following year,<br/>receiving a summary evaluation by May 1 in each of those years. Thereafter, the staff<br/>member may select to be evaluated under any Plan appropriate to the staff member’s<br/>experience in the District, (b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principal/administrator and</p>
<p>Superintendent’s staff determine that the staff member does not meet all standards at<br/>the end of the support period, the District will initiate termination procedures for<br/>unsatisfactory performance, if termination procedures have not already been initiated.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised support/improvement plan, progress reports, and summary evaluation<br/>required under Plan 4 will be placed in the staff member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>- 38 -</p>
<p>K. Parent and Student Input</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree that the purpose of student/parent input is to provide<br/>meaningful feedback to teachers and supervisors for the improvement of teaching performance.<br/>A staff member’s administrative supervisor(s) is/are the sole evaluator(s) of that staff member’s<br/>performance. The District is responsible for providing information to students and parents<br/>regarding the purpose of student and parent input and their opportunity to provide it. All staff<br/>members are required to collect signed input from parents in Grades K-12 and unsigned input<br/>from students in Grades 6-12. The procedure used for student input must provide for student<br/>anonymity.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff member may devise, subject to approval by his/her supervisor/evaluator, forms and<br/>procedures for the collection of student and parent input, or s/he may use forms and procedures<br/>provided by the District. Input forms shall include questions related to the staff member’s<br/>performance relative to the Standards.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student and parent input shall be collected by the staff member prior to the end of the first<br/>semester and for semester courses again prior to the end of the school year. The staff member<br/>shall share input received with his/her supervisor(s).</p>
<p>- 39 -</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>Leave Provisions</p>
<p>Statutory or regulatory leave provisions not specified in this Article are not subject to the<br/>grievance/arbitration mechanism. Article V.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>Members of the immediate family, as used in this section, mean the mother, father, grandmother,<br/>grandchild, or grandfather of the employee or of the spouse of the employee, and the spouse, son,<br/>son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, sister, sister-in-law, step-parent, or<br/>step-child of the employee; or any relative living in the immediate household of the employee. The<br/>immediate family shall also include any person who is a permanent member of the household who<br/>has been designated and identified as such on the annual employee emergency form. If a member of<br/>the immediate family falls outside this list, the unit member may apply for leave from the Human<br/>Resources administrator who may grant leave with pay provided the unit member satisfies the<br/>appropriate relationship to the bereaved unit member.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Illness and Injury Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time employees shall be entitled to ten (10) days leave with full-time pay for each school<br/>year for purposes of personal illness or injury. Employees who work less than full-time shall be<br/>entitled to that portion of the ten (10) days leave as the number of hours per week of scheduled<br/>duty relates to the number of hours for a full-time employee in a comparable position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year, when a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave, including<br/>accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent from duty on account of illness or accident<br/>for an additional 5 school months, the amount deducted from the salary for any of the additional<br/>five months in which the absence occurs shall be the amount actually paid a substitute employee<br/>employed to fill the position during the leave, or, if no substitute is employed, the amount that<br/>would have been paid to a substitute.</p>
<p>The accumulated sick leave and the five-month period shall run consecutively. A unit member<br/>may not be provided more than one five-month period per illness or accident. However, if a<br/>school year terminates before the five-month period is exhausted, the employee may take the<br/>balance of the five-month period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee does not utilize the ten (10) days of leave as authorized in the paragraphs above<br/>in any school year, the amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request by District management, an employee shall be required to present a medical<br/>doctor’s certificate verifying the personal illness or injury and/or a medical authorization to<br/>return to work. All personnel are required to report the reason for absence to qualify for pay<br/>during that absence, and to report their absences to the Attendance Reporting/SubFinder System.<br/>This reporting to the Attendance Reporting/SubFinder System is sufficient for absences of six (6)<br/>days or fewer. For absences in excess of six (6) days, verification may be made by a principal,<br/>supervisor, or medical doctor. If requested by the District management, an employee shall not<br/>return to work until he submits a medical doctor’s authorization to return to work.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee must contact the Attendance Reporting/SubFinder System as soon as the need to be<br/>absent is known. Failure to provide adequate notice may be grounds for denial of leave with<br/>pay. Chronic failure to provide adequate notice may be grounds for other disciplinary action.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is absent for one-half (1/2) day or less shall have deducted one-half (1/2) day<br/>from the accumulated leave; and if the absence exceeds more than one-half (1/2 day), a full day<br/>shall be deducted from accumulated leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, a unit member shall be informed of the individual’s accumulated leave.</p>
<p>- 40 -</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave that is credited under Section B of this Article may be used, at the employee’s election, for<br/>purposes of personal necessity, provided that use of such personal necessity leave does not<br/>exceed seven (7) days in any school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this provision, personal necessity shall be limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the employee’s immediate family</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unforeseen accident involving the employee’s person or property, or the person or<br/>property of the employee’s immediate family</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending school activities of the unit member’s child under Labor Code Section 230.8</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other activities that cannot reasonably be deferred to other than regular work hours, which<br/>are neither matters of personal convenience, recreational activities, or concerted activities.<br/>Important family events whose timing is not within the control of the staff member, such as<br/>weddings, graduations, or family reunions, will not be considered matters of convenience or<br/>recreation</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may use up to 20 days of personal necessity leave for matters related to the<br/>adoption of a child. In the case of adoption of a newborn infant, an additional 10 days may be<br/>used. In cases where both parents are district employees, the employees may share the personal<br/>necessity days specified for adoption in this section.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No prior permission is required for use of seven (7) days in any school year. However, the leave<br/>under “B.2.d” above cannot be used on the day immediately proceeding or following a holiday<br/>or vacation without prior approval from the principal or central department supervisor. If the<br/>immediate supervisor denies the request, the employee has the right to appeal to the Human<br/>Resources administrator. Employees utilizing personal necessity leave must identify which<br/>category above applies (“a,” “b,” “c,” or “d”) and shall make every effort to comply with the<br/>District procedures regarding advance notice to enable the District to secure a substitute.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>1. During a fiscal year, a unit member shall be allowed up to five (5) days of paid leave of absence<br/>per bereavement, without deductions from accumulated sick leave, in case of death in the<br/>immediate family.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request to use additional personal necessity days from the unit<br/>member’s accumulated sick leave if extenuating circumstances apply to his/her situation.<br/>The unit member shall submit a request in writing to the Human Resources administrator for<br/>consideration and prior approval for the use of any additional personal necessity days.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this leave are not cumulative, and must be used for the attendance at<br/>funeral services and related bereavement activities.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical Family Illness Leave</p>
<p>1. During a fiscal year, a unit member shall be allowed up to three (3) days of paid leave of absence<br/>for critical illness or serious injury to an immediate family member, without deductions from<br/>accumulated sick leave. For the purpose of this leave, the use of critical illness or serious injury<br/>leave requires the hospitalization of the immediate family member.</p>
<p>a. A unit member may use the personal necessity days specified in C.l of this Article to<br/>augment the critical family illness leave beyond the three (3) critical leave days specified<br/>above.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request to use additional personal necessity days from the unit<br/>member’s accumulated sick leave if extenuating circumstances apply to his/her situation.<br/>The unit member shall submit a request in writing to the Human Resources administrator for<br/>consideration and prior approval for the use of any additional personal necessity days.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this leave are not cumulative, and must be used for the attendance at<br/>funeral services and related bereavement activities.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave for Pregnancy Disability</p>
<p>Employees are entitled to use sick leave as set forth in Section B of this Article for disabilities<br/>caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom. Such leave<br/>shall not be used for childcare, child rearing, or preparation for childbearing, but shall be limited to<br/>those disabilities as set forth above. The length of such disability leave, including the date on which<br/>the leave shall commence and the date on which the duties are to be resumed shall be determined by<br/>the employee and the employee’s physician; however, the District management may require a<br/>verification of the extent of disability from the employee’s physician.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Birthing Parent Leave</p>
<p>A unit member may use up to a maximum of ten (10) additional days of personal necessity leave<br/>from the unit member’s accumulated sick leave at the time of the birth of the unit member’s non-<br/>adoptive child. The unit member may combine the ten additional days with any available personal<br/>leave days specified in Section C of this Article.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental Leave (Leave Without Pay for Child-Bearing Preparation, Child Adoption, and<br/>Child-Rearing)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental leave without pay and with medical insurance benefits may be granted to an employee<br/>for preparation for childbearing, child adoption, or for child-rearing, under the District rules and<br/>regulations for Family Medical Leave Act and California Family Care Leave Act under section N<br/>of this article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Family and Medical Leave is exhausted, or instead of Family and Medical Leave, an<br/>employee may request straight leave for continued parental leave under section “H” of this<br/>Article. This leave will be without pay or other benefits, except that medical insurance benefits<br/>will be extended for a total of five (5) months or until June 30, whichever is the lesser period.<br/>The duration of such leave shall be no more than twelve (12) consecutive months and shall<br/>automatically terminate on June 30 in the school year closest to the end of the twelve-month<br/>period. An extension of straight leave without pay or other benefits may be granted, not to<br/>exceed an additional twelve months.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall request such leave as soon as practicable, but under no circumstances less<br/>than thirty (30) work days prior to the date on which the leave is to begin. Such request shall be<br/>in writing and shall include a statement as to the dates the employee wishes to begin and end the<br/>leave without pay.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon consultation with the employee, the determination as to the date on which the leave shall<br/>begin and the duration of such leave shall be made at the discretion of the Superintendent or<br/>designee, when considering the scheduling and replacement problems of the District. See<br/>Section 0.2 of this article for information regarding returning from parental leave to a reduced<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee is not entitled to the use of any accrued sick leave or other paid leave while such<br/>employee is on a parental leave, whether or not the illness or disability is related to a pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall not be a diminution of employment status for parental leave, except that no<br/>employee shall be entitled to compensation, increment, nor shall the time taken on parental<br/>leave count toward credit for probationary teachers in earning tenure status.</p>
<p>- 42 -</p>
<p>7. If an employee is on parental leave and in the event of miscarriage or death of a child<br/>subsequent to childbirth, the employee may request an immediate assignment to a unit position.<br/>If there is a vacancy for which an employee is qualified, or if a vacancy develops, the District<br/>will assign the employee to a position as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will be entitled to industrial accident leave according to the provisions in the<br/>Education Code for personal injury that has qualified for Workers Compensation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not exceed sixty (60) days during which the schools of the District are required<br/>to be in session or when the employee would otherwise have been performing work for the<br/>District in any one fiscal year for the same industrial accident.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall not be accumulative from year to year. When an industrial accident or<br/>illness occurs at a time when the full sixty (60) days will overlap into the next fiscal year, the<br/>employee shall be entitled to only that amount remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which<br/>the injury or illness occurred, for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to have the employee examined by a physician designated by the<br/>District to assist in determining the length of time during which the employee will be temporarily<br/>unable to perform assigned duties and the degree to which a disability is attributable to the injury<br/>involved.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall deduct from the employee’s salary warrant the amount of such disability<br/>indemnity actually paid from the Workers’ Compensation Fund to and retained by the employee.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall be provided leave for regularly called jury duty, and to appear as a witness in<br/>Court, other than as a litigant, for reasons not brought about through the convenience or<br/>misconduct of the employee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee, while serving jury duty, will receive pay in the amount of the difference between<br/>the employee’s regular earnings and any amount received for jury service. The employee may<br/>retain any fee paid as a travel allowance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee does not wish jury duty pay to be deducted from the paycheck, he/she must<br/>submit a check for the amount of the jury duty pay with the monthly absence report covering the<br/>time he/she was on judicial leave.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Leaves Without Pay</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leave of absence without compensation may be granted to any teacher for a period of not less than<br/>one semester, nor more than one year, for the purpose of: (1) teaching programs in other states,<br/>territories, or countries, or military teaching programs; (2) Peace Corps, Teacher Corps, or Job<br/>Corps, as a full-time participant; (3) cultural travel; (4) work programs related to the teacher’s<br/>professional responsibilities; (5) rest; (6) public office; (7) continued parental leave as described in<br/>E2 of this Article, (8) care for a member of the immediate family who is ill; (9) long-term illness of<br/>the employee; (10) disability; or (11) other reasons acceptable to the Board.

<p>L. Sabbatical Leaves</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave may be granted to certificated employees after seven years of continuous<br/>service for the purpose of permitting study or travel, which will benefit the schools and pupils of<br/>the District. Certificated employees may apply for a full-year or a semester or quarter-year<br/>sabbatical leave. No more than two (2) percent of the certificated staff may be on sabbatical<br/>leave.

The Human<br/>Resources administrator shall act as an advisory non-voting member of the panel. Should the<br/>panel need help in determining the value of a project and its equivalence to course units, it may<br/>choose to call in a special panel of educators conversant with the subject area involved. The<br/>panel’s confidential recommendations shall be submitted to the Superintendent no later than<br/>February 10. Final recommendation for sabbatical leaves shall be at the discretion of the<br/>Superintendent, with Board action taken not later than the first Board meeting in March. The<br/>Board of Education retains the right to either grant or deny any and all sabbatical leaves.<br/>Denials of committee recommendations shall be explained in writing to the members of the<br/>panel.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave Requirements</p>
<p>Service: Sabbatical leaves must be preceded by at least seven consecutive years of service,<br/>all of which shall have been served as a regular certificated employee in the Palo Alto<br/>Unified School District. Qualifying service shall be as defined in the Education Code.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave Applications</p>
<p>(1) Plans for sabbatical leave should be made with the full knowledge of the principal of the<br/>school in which the applicant is serving.</p>
<p>- 44 -</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications that appear to meet the objectives of Board policy and are consistent with<br/>administrative procedures must be submitted to the Certificated Human Resources Office<br/>by January 10 of the year preceding the proposed sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate application forms for sabbatical leaves may be secured through the<br/>Certificated Human Resources Office.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation While on a Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee on sabbatical leave shall receive compensation as follows:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Year Sabbatical —The difference between the salary the employee would have<br/>received and the salary at AB +45, step 6.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-half Year Sabbatical — Three-fourths of the employee’s annual salary. (Full<br/>salary for semester not on leave and one-half salary for semester on leave.)</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarter-year Sabbatical — Seven-eighths of the employee’s annual salary. (Full<br/>salary for semester and quarter not on leave and one-half salary for quarter on leave.)</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall continue to pay life, health, dental, and vision insurance premiums as<br/>set forth in Article VI of this agreement.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the employee’s option, the employee may purchase service credit equivalent to the<br/>sabbatical leave period pursuant to the State Teachers Retirement System rules and<br/>regulations.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave time shall count as regular service for salary purposes. As a condition of<br/>being granted sabbatical leave, the unit member shall agree in writing to render a period<br/>of service to the District following the return from leave which is equal to twice the</p>
<p>period of leave.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect of Sabbatical Leave on Salary Increments and Retirement</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who acquires twelve semester units per semester’s leave shall be credited with<br/>one complete semester of teaching service for salary increment purposes. Sabbatical<br/>leave credit for salary increments will be tentatively granted on approval of the sabbatical<br/>leave program submitted with the application. Completion of the program must be<br/>verified by April 15 for those returning from first semester leave and November 15 for<br/>those returning from second semester and full-year leave. Failure to verify completion by<br/>this date will result in the loss of any salary granted on the basis of the approved preplan.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher’s normal percentage rate of deduction for retirement purposes shall be<br/>applied to the actual salary received by the teacher. Time on sabbatical leave is credited<br/>as service in the proportion that the compensation received bears to the full compensation<br/>earnable on a full-time basis. Within a two-year period, an individual may receive full¬<br/>time credit by paying to the system additional contributions based on the compensation<br/>that is the difference between compensation earned and the compensation earnable during<br/>the period of sabbatical leave.</p>

<p>M. Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>The Association and the District agree to establish a Catastrophic Leave Bank, effective July 1,<br/>1998.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have exhausted all applicable paid leaves provided for in the collective<br/>agreement, excluding differential pay, may apply for Catastrophic Leave under this Article.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for Catastrophic Leave, the unit member must have suffered an illness or injury<br/>that is expected to incapacitate him/her for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates a<br/>member of the bargaining unit member’s immediate family, and that incapacity requires the<br/>bargaining unit member to take time off from work for an extended period of time to care for<br/>that family member, and taking extended time off from work creates a financial hardship for<br/>the bargaining unit member because all of her or his sick leave and other paid time off has<br/>been exhausted. “Immediate family members” shall be defined in Section A of the Article.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member’s use of Catastrophic Leave shall not exceed a cumulative maximum of sixty<br/>(60) days per unit member. Catastrophic Leave shall be taken in full day increments. The use<br/>of differential pay will follow, when appropriate, the use of the allocated Catastrophic Leave<br/>days.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the Catastrophic Leave Bank is voluntary. Unit members who wish to<br/>participate will donate at least one (1) sick day upon joining. Further donations may be<br/>required when the committee calls for them. New hires will have sixty (60) calendar days<br/>from the date of hire to elect to participate. Only those who donate may receive<br/>contributions from the Bank. If a unit member decides to discontinue participation in the<br/>Bank, the unit member may rejoin during an open enrollment period during the month of<br/>October.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who do not join the Bank when they first becoming eligible must wait until the<br/>next open enrollment period (during the month of October) to join, and they will not be<br/>eligible to receive a contribution from the Bank until the subsequent school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee shall be established that includes three (3) unit<br/>members appointed by the Association and two (2) members appointed by the District. The<br/>Committee shall be responsible for administering the Catastrophic Leave Bank in accordance<br/>with this Agreement and applicable state law. The Committee’s duties are:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving leave requests</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verifying the validity of requests</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approving or denying requests</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating the Committee’s decisions to affected unit members and the District</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soliciting donations of sick leave from eligible unit members as needed</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing special circumstances of a member that prohibit him or her from donating<br/>additional days in order to continue as a member of the Bank and</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting donations of days of sick leave for the Bank from unit members who wish to<br/>donate in the name of a colleague. This constitutes immediate membership in the Bank.<br/>The donated days will not increase the maximum number of days the individual may<br/>receive</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall designate one of its members as Chairperson.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will establish appropriate record-keeping procedures, including the total<br/>number of accumulated days in the Bank and the names of participating members.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose the nature of any<br/>illness except as is necessary to process the request for leave and appeals of denials.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave requests shall only be approved by a majority vote of the Committee.</p>
<p>- 47 -</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application Procedure</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who wishes to use Catastrophic Leave shall submit a request on the<br/>appropriate form to the Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee, stating the facts that support<br/>his/her need for Catastrophic Leave. Each request for a withdrawal from the Bank or<br/>extension of a withdrawal must be accompanied by medical verification of the need for the<br/>leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall review the unit member’s application and make its decision within a<br/>reasonable period of time.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee determines that the unit member is eligible for Catastrophic Leave, it<br/>shall designate the number of days of eligibility. No days may be granted retroactively. The<br/>Committee may approve eligibility in renewable increments not to exceed thirty (30) days. If<br/>donated days of sick leave are available from the Leave Bank, they may be used by the unit<br/>member. If sufficient days are not available, the Committee may solicit donations of days<br/>from eligible unit members in accordance with this Agreement on the appropriate form<br/>approved by the Association and the District.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Committee denies a request for withdrawal from the Bank, or an extension of<br/>withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the request, the Committee shall notify the<br/>unit member, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Committee reasonably believes that the unit member may be eligible for disability<br/>allowance or disability retirement under STRS or Social Security, the Committee may<br/>request that the unit member apply for those benefits. If the unit member refuses to submit a<br/>complete application, including medical information provided by the unit member’s<br/>physician, within twenty (20) calendar days, he/she shall no longer be eligible to withdraw<br/>days from the Catastrophic Leave Bank for the pending application.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall comply with any requests for additional information from STRS or<br/>Social Security within fifteen (15) calendar days, or his/her eligibility to participate in the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall cease. If denied benefits by STRS or Social Security, the unit<br/>member must appeal, or his/her eligibility to participate in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall<br/>cease.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations to Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating unit members may donate a maximum of three (3) days of accrued, full-time<br/>sick leave to the Catastrophic Leave Bank each school year in full day increments only, upon<br/>a solicitation by the Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee. Donations are irrevocable, and<br/>shall not be returned to unit members upon their cancellation of membership in the Bank.<br/>All contributions to the Bank are voluntary.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee may solicit an additional day or days,<br/>depending upon need, when the bank of days drops to or below fifty (50) days. The<br/>solicitation shall be made by the Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee. A unit member’s<br/>membership in the Bank may be canceled if they fail to make a donation when donations are<br/>solicited. Eligibility, if available, may only be reestablished in accordance with Section le.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused days remaining in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall carry over from year to year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members using days granted to them from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall not accrue<br/>any other leave provided by this Agreement or by law.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability that qualifies a unit member for<br/>workers’ compensation benefits.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank donations are subject to appeal to the Committee only and are<br/>not subject to review or appeal under any other procedure. Specifically, the Catastrophic</p>
<p>Leave Bank Committee’s exercise of the rights and discretion described in this Article shall<br/>not be subject to the grievance/arbitration procedure. Except for allegations that the District<br/>failed to cooperate as required by this Section, no grievance may be filed against the District<br/>alleging a violation of Section (M).</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank has insufficient days to fund a withdrawal request, the<br/>Committee is under no obligation to provide days and the District is under no obligation to pay<br/>the unit member any funds whatsoever.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be returned to the then-current members of the Bank<br/>proportionately. In no event shall any unit member receive more sick leave days than she/he<br/>donated to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Leave Act</p>
<p>Unit members are eligible for leave under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act and the<br/>California Family Care Leave Act. The parties will prepare a memorandum covering the various<br/>rights and obligations, including those areas where discretion may be exercised by the District and/or<br/>employees. This will be distributed to the work site.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced Employment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to March 1, a unit member may request in writing reduced employment for the subsequent<br/>school year. In the event the District agrees to reduce the unit member’s employment, such<br/>reduction shall be granted for not less than one (1) year nor more than five (5) years provided<br/>further that the parties mutually agree to the amount the employment shall be reduced and the<br/>date on which the unit member may elect in writing to return to the unit member’s prior<br/>employment percentage. If the reduced assignment results in two teachers instructing the same<br/>students, i .e. sharing one assignment, the provisions of Article VII, Section D must be met.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member returns from parental leave that ends during the school year, the District<br/>will make an effort to honor a request for reduced employment status upon return, provided that:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for reduced employment was made before the parental leave began,</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A replacement teacher satisfactory to the District is available for the parental leave and<br/>agrees to continue during the reduced employment period.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may renew his/her reduced employment status by completing the appropriate<br/>form in the Certificated Human Resources Office. The March 1 deadline date also applies to the<br/>renewal.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the unit member does not elect in writing by March 1 to return to the prior<br/>employment percentage, the unit member’s employment percentage shall be permanently<br/>reduced. However, the unit member and the District may mutually agree to reduce or extend<br/>within the above period of reduced employment.</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for Leave</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits</p>
<p>While on approved leave, a unit member shall be considered to be a member of the department<br/>or school from which he/she is on leave. Upon return, the unit member shall be given equal<br/>consideration with other members of that department or school for continued assignment in that<br/>school or department. He/she, spouse and named dependents, shall be permitted to remain in<br/>District fringe benefit programs when on unpaid leave provided that: (1) the unit member pays</p>

<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>Working Conditions</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Preparation/Planning</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide an elementary traveling team in the form of additional specialized<br/>instruction to provide preparation and planning time for teachers in elementary grades 1 through</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveling teachers shall be members of the staff at each site served.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time K through Grade 5 teachers at the elementary level shall have preparation/planning<br/>time during the student attendance day as follows:</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers teaching an intermediate day —190 minutes per week.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sites are encouraged to schedule blocks of common grade level planning time.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the time listed above for primary teachers, the period between the end of the<br/>primary instructional day and the end of the intermediate instructional day will be used for<br/>instructional preparation, individual and joint planning, and scheduled parent and staff<br/>conferences. The teacher has the professional discretion to use the time within these purposes.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Preparation/Planning/Conferencing</p>
<p>Full time classroom teachers at the middle and high school levels shall have two sevenths (2/7) of<br/>the instructional periods for the purpose of instructional preparation, individual and joint planning,<br/>parent and staff conferencing, and student support. The classroom teacher has the professional<br/>discretion to use the time within these purposes.

Middle school elective subject “team”<br/>members, who are unable to attend the team meetings, shall participate by contributing their<br/>views/information on meeting topics on a weekly basis. The scheduling of preparation periods shall<br/>be done at the site level to meet the needs of the program, staff, and students.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same-Day Multiple-Site Secondary Classroom Teachers</p>
<p>Classroom teachers whose assignments require them to travel to different secondary school sites<br/>during the same teaching day (multiple-site teachers) and who are not members of the district-wide<br/>traveling music and P.E. teams shall be entitled to the following rights.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrators in collaboration with the teacher shall determine which school will be the<br/>primary site of assignment for the purposes of attendance at required meetings when the meeting<br/>times conflict. It is the expectation that the teacher will be required to attend the number of<br/>meetings normally required of teachers assigned solely to the primary site served by the multiple<br/>site teacher.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple-Site teachers shall be given a reasonable travel time between schools, except in<br/>extraordinary circumstances. In extraordinary circumstances, the site administrators at each site<br/>and the affected teacher shall work together to define the expectations of each site and develop a<br/>plan with the teacher to mitigate the circumstances. A full time teacher who is required to travel<br/>between sites during his/her workday shall be paid a full-time traveling teacher stipend pursuant<br/>to Appendix H.</p>
<p>- 52 -</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Medical Procedures</p>
<p>Unit members will not be required to be primary providers of necessary pupil medical procedures.<br/>However, unit members will be expected to provide backup service in extraordinary circumstances<br/>or when the primary provider is unexpectedly incapacitated. The District and the Association will<br/>establish an ongoing list, which defines “medical procedures” which are covered by this provision.<br/>Unit members may agree to receive an annual stipend for being the on-site primary provider of<br/>necessary pupil medical procedures. The Primary Medical Provider Stipend is listed in Appendix H.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Status After Change in Assignment</p>
<p>For teachers who are assigned to a new discipline at the secondary level, or for elementary teachers<br/>who are assigned a new grade level, the District will provide additional training and support as<br/>necessary.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety Conditions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following procedure will be utilized to provide a written response to matters, which<br/>negatively impact the safe and orderly learning environment. This procedure will require the site<br/>principal to provide a written response within five (5) workdays of the date the unit member’s<br/>written concern was first received. In addition, if the unit member believes that the written<br/>response was inadequate, or that the action taken was insufficient to remedy the unsafe<br/>condition, then the unit member may receive a written response from the Superintendent or<br/>designee within ten (10) workdays of the receipt of such a request from the unit member. Forms<br/>for such submissions will be made available at each school site.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 24 hours of verifying the information, the Superintendent or designee shall inform the<br/>teachers and administrators at a site that a potentially violent student is assigned to their site.<br/>Within three days of this notification, a site administrator will schedule a meeting involving all<br/>personnel who have regular contact with the student to develop an appropriate support plan or to<br/>modify an existing plan. If the student changes teachers or grade levels at a site, all personnel<br/>who have regular contact with the student will have the opportunity to review and modify the<br/>plan.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the 1998-99 school year, the District will develop procedures for implementing<br/>this provision and will train unit members about teacher rights and responsibilities in dealing<br/>with students identified under this section.</p>
<p>- 53 -</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIV<br/>Non-Discrimination</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree to provide a learning and work environment free from</p>
<p>discrimination and harassment based upon race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, religion, age,</p>
<p>physical or mental disability, or marital status.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding other Board policies and procedures, if a unit member believes that an incident<br/>of illegal discrimination or harassment has occurred, the unit member should first notify the<br/>immediate supervisor of the incident. If the immediate supervisor is believed to be involved in<br/>the alleged incident, the unit member should report the matter to a person having authority over<br/>the person(s) engaged in the alleged illegal activity. The supervisor shall investigate and take<br/>appropriate action, including reporting the matter to the Human Resources administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of observation or awareness of an incident of discrimination, the unit member should<br/>inform the person(s) responsible for the discrimination that the act(s) were inappropriate and/or<br/>unwelcome, and that the behavior should stop.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the above procedures do not satisfactorily remedy the illegal conduct, the unit member should<br/>report the matter to the Human Resources administrator, or designee, who shall conduct an<br/>investigation into the allegations.

Unofficial verification of college coursework<br/>may be in the form of a grade report or instructor letter. By November 15 final official<br/>verification of pre-planned activities that have resulted in salary column advancement must be<br/>submitted to the Certificated Human Resources Office. Failure to provide final official<br/>verification of pre-planned activities that resulted in salary column advancement by the deadline<br/>above will result a payroll reversal to the previous salary column level for the current school<br/>year.</p>
<p>Failure to meet the May or November deadlines, even if the activities have been completed, will<br/>result in the salary advancement not taking effect until the following school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All activities proposed for salary advancement must be related to one or more of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District goals and priorities;</p>

<p>APPENDIX D<br/>Pre-Retirement Employment &amp; Post-Retirement Programs</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced Workload Program (Willie Brown Program)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may reduce employment from full- to part-time, and receive service credit the<br/>unit member would have received if employed on a full-time basis, provided the unit member<br/>meets all the requirements of this subsection and Education Code 22713 and the following<br/>District criteria.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment must be exercised at the unit member’s request and,<br/>once granted, can be revoked only with the mutual consent of the District and the unit<br/>member. The employment level can be increased or decreased within the limitation of part-<br/>time employment no less than 50%.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must submit a request to participate in this program to the Personnel Office<br/>no later than March 1 of the school year preceding the desired year of participation.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must have reached the age of fifty-five (55) prior to the school year in<br/>which the reduction in workload starts.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must have been employed full-time in a position requiring certification for<br/>at least ten (10) years, of which the immediately preceding five (5) years were full-time<br/>employment. For the purposes of this section, approved leaves of absences shall not<br/>constitute a break in service.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member’s participation in the reduced workload program may not exceed 10 years.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the unit member shall agree to make the appropriate contributions to the<br/>State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) equal to the amount required as if serving as a<br/>full-time unit member.</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final determination the form of part-time employment and the qualifications necessary to<br/>meet the District’s instructional needs rests within the sole discretion of the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum part-time employment shall be the equivalent of one-half (1/2) of the number of<br/>days of service required by the unit member’s contract of employment during his/her final year<br/>of service in a full-time position. Except for the reduction of salary corresponding to the reduced<br/>workload, the District will provide the part-time unit member with the same fringe benefits<br/>provided a regular full-time unit member.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Governing Board agrees, the reduced service may be on a part-time daily schedule or full¬<br/>time for at least one-half (1/2) year. Regardless of the work schedule, the unit member and<br/>District contributions must be paid monthly to STRS.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who terminate before the end of the school year will receive retirement credit based<br/>on the salary actually paid in the proportion that it relates to the annual salary that would have been<br/>paid had the employment continued. Retirement contributions for services not actually performed<br/>will be returned to the unit member and the District. The amount of sick leave earned while on<br/>reduced workload will vary directly to the percent of full-time employment. For example, fifty<br/>percent (50%) employment would yield ten (10) days of half-time sick leave or five (5) days of<br/>full-time sick leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Retirement Employment Programs</p>
<p>A. Retired teachers employed pursuant to this program shall be placed in distinct classes of<br/>temporary teachers within the bargaining unit. A teacher shall be classified as a “Retired<br/>Temporary Teacher” if hired pursuant to these sections. The service of a Retired Temporary</p>
<p>Teacher shall not be included in computing the service required as a prerequisite to attainment of<br/>or eligibility for classification as a permanent employee of a school district.</p>
<p>B Retired Temporary Teachers and Retired Temporary Remedial Teachers shall be compensated<br/>according to the salary schedule set forth in Appendix A.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired Temporary Teachers and Retired Temporary Remedial Teachers shall receive health and<br/>welfare benefits contribution specified in Section 3 of this Appendix.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired Temporary Teachers shall not be subject to the evaluation requirements of Article 10.</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher retired with an effective date on or before January 1, 2000, and will provide<br/>direct classroom instruction to students in kindergarten through eighth grade, and/or will<br/>provide services to beginning teachers specified in Education Code Section 24216.5<br/>(a)(2); or</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher retired with an effective date on or before July 1, 2000, and will provide<br/>direct remedial instruction to students in grades 2 through 8 as defined in Education Code<br/>Sections 37252 and 37252.5.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Retirement Employment, Effective January 1, 2001, to June 30, 2009</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals who return to employment with the District after being retired for a period of<br/>twelve (12) months will earn full salary and without a reduction in retirement allowance,<br/>and without requirement of a contribution to STRS for salary earned.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree must work in a position requiring a certificate, and must otherwise qualify under<br/>the provisions of Education Code Section 24214.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This K-12 employment may be either full-time or part-time. The District retains the final<br/>discretion as to the type of work, the percentage of part-time work, the qualifications for the<br/>work, and the availability of work.</p>
<p>(4) . At the option of the retiree, the compensation shall be in the form of regular salary, or, to the<br/>extent legally permissible, the employee may earn credits in lieu of salary for health and<br/>welfare benefits or Medicare Part B.</p>
<p>3. Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unit members whose first date of paid contracted service is prior to June 1, 2009 and retiring<br/>after June 30, 2002, the District will contribute the same amount to health and welfare benefits as<br/>though the unit member were an active member with the same percentage of paid benefits as<br/>held immediately prior to retirement, for a period of five years, age 65, or is eligible for<br/>Medicare, whichever occurs first; provided:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree has twenty years of full-time service or the equivalent of twenty years of full-time<br/>service in the District, and</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree has reached age fifty-five.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members in the Early Retiree Benefits Program described in Appendix D, Section 3A shall<br/>make monthly contributions in the same amount as an active employee in the same benefit plan<br/>with the same percentage of paid benefits.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals drawing STRS benefits while employed by the District under any of these post¬<br/>retirement employment programs at 50% or more will receive the same contribution to District<br/>health and welfare benefits as other unit members, until age sixty-five (65) or eligible for<br/>Medicare, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>D Individuals drawing STRS benefits while employed by the District in a post-retirement program<br/>less than 50% full-time may elect to earn salary combined with health and welfare benefits in<br/>lieu of a commensurate salary, until age sixty-five (65) or eligible for Medicare, whichever<br/>occurs first.</p>
<p>E. If a retiree wishes to participate in health and welfare benefits, the retiree may purchase the<br/>benefits through direct payment to the District, provided the retiree is otherwise qualified for the<br/>benefits under the carrier’s provisions.</p>
<p>F Retirees eligible for paid full-time medical coverage for a period of five years or until attaining<br/>age sixty-five (65), whichever occurs first, may choose to decline the District medical coverage<br/>and receive $6000 for each year of eligibility the retiree declines (except as prohibited by law).<br/>Early retirees may not return to district medical coverage once the coverage has been declined. It<br/>is within the sole discretion of the District to continue to offer this provision to new early retirees<br/>for each successive year of this agreement.</p>

<p>3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any permanent teacher who has been placed on Evaluation Plan 3 because of not meeting<br/>standards in Clusters 1, 2, or 3 of the PAUSD Teaching Standards must participate in the<br/>program.</p>
<p>3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher’s assistance and review shall focus on the specific areas<br/>identified in the support/improvement plan developed by the RPT’s Evaluator(s) when<br/>the RPT was placed on Plan 3.</p>
<p>3.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These areas for improvement shall be aligned with student learning, clearly<br/>stated, and consistent with Education Code Section 44662. These<br/>recommendations shall be considered as the performance goals required by<br/>Education Code Sections 44664(a) and 44500(b)(2).</p>
<p>3.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principal and the Consulting Teacher assigned shall meet and discuss the<br/>recommended areas of improvement outlined by the Principal and the types of<br/>assistance that should be provided by the Consulting Teacher.</p>
<p>3.1.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher and the Evaluator(s) are expected to establish a<br/>cooperative relationship and shall coordinate and align the assistance provided to<br/>the RPT.</p>
<p>3.1.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher and the RPT shall meet to discuss the plan for<br/>assistance. After that meeting, the Consulting Teacher will provide the<br/>assistance set forth in Section 4.2.6, which shall also involve conducting multiple<br/>classroom observations of the RPT.</p>
<p>3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the time period specified in the support/improvement plan, the Consulting<br/>Teacher shall complete a written report describing the teacher’s participation in the<br/>Program. This report shall consist solely of: (1) a description of the assistance provided<br/>by the Consulting Teacher; and (2) a description of the RPT’s participation in the<br/>Program. This report shall be submitted to the Joint Panel, with copies also submitted to<br/>the RPT and the Evaluator(s).</p>
<p>3.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher’s report (described in 3.1.3) shall be made available as part of<br/>the RPT’s annual evaluation. Either the Evaluator or the RPT may choose to have the<br/>report included in the annual evaluation.</p>
<p>3.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the report, the Joint Panel shall determine whether the RPT will benefit<br/>from continued participation in the Program.</p>
<p>3.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RPT will continue participating in the Program until the Joint Panel determines that<br/>s/he will no longer benefit from participation, the RPT receives a satisfactory evaluation,<br/>or the RPT is placed on Evaluation Plan 4, whichever occurs first. The RPT’s Evaluator<br/>will determine whether s/he has been able to demonstrate satisfactory improvement.</p>
<p>3.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of RPT’s who, after sustained assistance, are not able to demonstrate<br/>satisfactory improvement will be forwarded by the Joint Panel to the Governing Board.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Beginning Teachers</p>
<p>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Consulting Teacher may be assigned to one or more beginning teachers to provide<br/>assistance. Priority will be given to teachers in their first two years in the district who are<br/>not eligible for the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment Program.</p>
<p>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first year the Consulting Teacher shall concentrate the assistance on any area of the<br/>District’s Teaching Standards. In the second year, the Consulting Teacher will focus the<br/>assistance on any areas identified as needing improvement and/or assistance.</p>

<p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70-</p>
<p>3.2.4 Because beginning teachers’ participation in the Program is not legally mandated, neither<br/>the Consulting Teacher nor the Joint Panel will make written reports regarding individual<br/>beginning teachers, nor forward to the Board the names of individual beginning teachers<br/>who participated in the Program.</p>
<p>3.3 For Voluntary Participating Teachers (VPT)</p>
<p>3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers eligible to be Voluntary Participating Teachers (VPT) may submit to the Joint<br/>Panel a proposal to work with a Consulting Teacher or to participate in any activity<br/>approved by the Joint Panel that utilizes the concept of peer assistance and support.</p>
<p>3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because permanent teachers with satisfactory performance are not mandated by law to<br/>participate in the Program, neither the Consulting Teacher nor the Joint Panel will<br/>forward to the Board the names of individual VPTs or report on the outcome of their<br/>participation. At the request of a VPT who is on Evaluation Plan 2B, however, the<br/>Consulting Teacher may write the required partner response to the teacher’s summary<br/>evaluation (Article X, Section C.2.c.3.f).</p>
<p>4. Governance and Program Structure</p>
<p>4.1 Joint Panel</p>

<p>APPENDIX G<br/>Controversial Issues<br/>(from Board Policy Manual, Chapter III — Instruction)</p>
<p>This provision is attached to the Collective Bargaining Agreement for information purposes only, and is<br/>not subject to review or enforcement through the grievance/arbitration mechanism.</p>
<p>The examination and discussion in classrooms of important controversial issues has educational value<br/>and may be pursued when appropriate to the course of study. Events of such significance may occur so<br/>as to make discussion acceptable in other courses. Teachers shall:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct discussions in a spirit of honest inquiry;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guide discussions to provide opportunity for students to hear and consider differing views of the<br/>issue; and</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See that such discussions do not unduly preempt time from the regular course of study.</p>
<p>Forums at which timely issues are debated or closely spaced talks by speakers who can ably present<br/>opposing views are encouraged. Organized groups or individuals wishing to provide students with<br/>information or to make presentations to classes concerning controversial issues shall make application to<br/>the Superintendent of Schools, who shall determine the relevance of such presentations to the welfare of the<br/>students and to their education.</p>
<p>The Board shall support staff members when they have acted in the spirit of this policy, which obligates<br/>teachers to approach controversial issues in the spirit of inquiry rather than advocacy.</p>
<p>Administrative Procedure: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controversial issues shall be freely discussed in the classrooms of the</p>
<p>District in accordance with the prudent judgment of teachers and in conformity with the provision of<br/>professional codes of ethics. In the discussion of controversial issues, teachers should consistently relate<br/>them to the democratic process and emphasize that differences of opinion and protest are to be exercised<br/>in the context of majority of decision and willingness to abide by that decision. Respect for minority<br/>opinion should be encouraged. Responsible citizenship within a framework of free and informed<br/>expression should be the instructional goal of all teachers who deal with controversy in the classroom.<br/>In handling discussions of controversial issues, the school personnel should consider that the students<br/>have the following rights:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To study any controversial issue which has political, economic or social significance and upon<br/>which they should begin to form opinions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have free access to all relevant information including the materials that circulate freely within<br/>the community. The exception to this procedural matter results from Education Code Section 8506.<br/>This section provides that any audiovisual or written materials, excluding state adopted texts, that<br/>include information on human reproduction processes or functions may not be used without<br/>providing parents with the opportunity to review and without parental permission.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To study under competent instruction in an atmosphere free of bias and prejudice or external<br/>pressures.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To form and express their own opinions in the classroom on controversial issues without<br/>jeopardizing their relations with the teacher or the school, when the issues discussed are relevant to<br/>the instructional program.</p>
