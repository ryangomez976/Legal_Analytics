<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE<br/>A grievance is defined as a formal written statement by a unit member and/or the<br/>Association that the District has violated an express term of this Agreement and that<br/>by reason of such violation, his or her rights have been adversely affected. All other<br/>matters and disputes of any nature are beyond the scope of these procedures. Also<br/>excluded from these procedures are those matters so indicated elsewhere in this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>The respondent in all cases shall be the District itself rather than any individual. The<br/>filing or pendency of a grievance shall not delay or interfere with implementation of<br/>any District action during the processing thereof.</p>
<p>A “day” is a day in which the central administration office of the District is open for<br/>business.</p>
<p>Informal Stage</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>6.5</p>
<p>6.5.1</p>
<p>6.5.1.1</p>
<p>6.5.1.2</p>
<p>6.5.1.3<br/>6.5.2</p>
<p>6.5.2.1</p>
<p>6.5.2.2</p>
<p>6.5.2.3</p>
<p>6.6</p>
<p>6.6.1</p>
<p>6.6.2</p>
<p>6.7</p>
<p>means of an informal conference with the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>Formal Stage<br/>Level 1</p>
<p>Within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the<br/>grievance, or within twenty (20) days of when the grievant or the Association could<br/>reasonably have known of the act or omission, the grievant must present his/her<br/>grievance in writing to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>The written statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, including<br/>the specific provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been violated, the<br/>circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the informal conference, and the<br/>specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>Either party may request a personal conference with the other party. The<br/>Superintendent shall communicate a decision to the grievant in writing within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the grievance and such action will terminate Level 1.</p>
<p>Level II</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the recommendation(s) of the<br/>Superintendent, he/she may appeal the decision to the Board of Education within ten</p>
<p>(10) days of the Superintendent’s decision in 6.5.1.3.</p>
<p>This appeal shall include at least a clear, concise statement of the decision rendered,<br/>and the reasons for appeal.</p>
<p>The Board of Education will consider the appeal within 20 days or at the next<br/>regularly scheduled meeting of the board provided that the parties have at least 10<br/>days prior notice of the hearing date. The time period begins on the date the appeal is<br/>personally received by the Superintendent. The parties may mutually agree to a<br/>hearing date, which is beyond the limits set forth in this section.</p>
<p>The Board of Education shall communicate its decision to the grievant and the<br/>Association within ten (10) days after consideration. The decision of the Board shall<br/>be final and binding.</p>
<p>Failure to Meet Time Limits</p>
<p>If a grievance is not processed by the grievant in accordance with the time limits set<br/>forth in this Article, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the decision last<br/>made by the District. If the District fails to respond to the grievance in a timely<br/>manner at any level, the running of the time limit shall be deemed a denial of the<br/>grievance and termination of the level involved, and the grievant may proceed to the<br/>next step.</p>
<p>Time limits hereunder may be lengthened or shortened in any particular case only by<br/>mutual agreement.</p>
<p>The parties will attempt, in good faith, to adjust time limit problems, which occur<br/>above Level 1 as a result of the summer recess.</p>
<p>Association Representation</p>
<p>The grievant shall be entitled upon request to representation by the Association at all<br/>grievance meetings. In situations where the Association has not been requested to<br/>represent the grievant, the District will not agree to a final resolution of the grievance<br/>until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution, and has been given the opportunity to state its views on the matter. Ten<br/>(10) days will be considered an opportunity in this instance.</p>

All records<br/>used in this grievance procedure which may have derived from the official personnel<br/>files maintained by the District, will be returned to those files without indication that<br/>they had been used in this grievance procedure.</p>
<p>Group Grievance</p>
<p>Should the Association and the District feel that the significant characteristics of a<br/>number of individual grievances are sufficiently alike that it would be in the best<br/>interest of time to hear this group of grievances as one (1), they may mutually agree<br/>to do so. In such instances, a group grievance would be filed at Level 1 of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>Forms</p>
<p>Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents will be prepared jointly by the<br/>Principal/Superintendent and the Association and given appropriate distribution by<br/>the Association so as to facilitate operation of the grievance procedure. The costs of<br/>preparing such forms shall be borne by the Board.</p>
<p>No Reprisals</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Principal/Superintendent or by any<br/>member or representative of the administration or the Board against any aggrieved<br/>party, any party in interest, any member of the Association or any other participant in<br/>the grievance procedure by reason of such participation. Similarly no reprisals of any<br/>kind will be taken by the grievant, any unit member or the Association against the<br/>Principal/Superintendent, Board Member, Board Representative, parent, or other<br/>participant in the grievance by reason of such participation.</p>

<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discuss and attempt to mutually agree on the unit member’s goals and objectives;<br/>and</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To discuss the District’s goals and objectives for its course of study, expected<br/>student achievement, and unit member performance criteria; and</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow the Superintendent to familiarize the unit member with the observation<br/>and evaluation forms; and</p>

<p>11.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member, in cooperation with the evaluator, shall develop objectives in at<br/>least two of areas in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP).</p>

<p>11.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each observation done shall be followed by a conference, within ten(10) workdays,<br/>between the unit member and the evaluator to discuss the activities and behavior<br/>observed as well as data collected and to prepare a written report which will be<br/>attached to the resulting evaluation.</p>
<p>11.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member shall sign the formal observation; however, such signature indicates<br/>that the observation report has been discussed with the member and does not<br/>necessarily constitute agreement with the judgment of the evaluator.</p>
<p>11.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a member receives an objectionable written observation report, he/she shall be<br/>entitled to not less than one (1) additional observation and conference other than<br/>those provided elsewhere in this section.

<p>11.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written evaluation report shall be based on the member’s performance in the<br/>areas of:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructional and non-instructional duties; and</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attainment of the agreed upon objectives that are consistent with applicable<br/>District goals and standards and</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member’s professional conduct within the scope of his/her assigned<br/>responsibilities.</p>

Such action shall include<br/>specific recommendations for improvement and direct assistance in implementing<br/>such recommendations.</p>
<p>11.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member is directed to seek such remedial assistance, the District shall pay for<br/>the registration or tuition fees, materials necessary, and a substitute teacher, if<br/>necessary, providing Education Code section 44664(b) has been invoked in writing.<br/>The member will not receive professional growth credits for purposes of salary<br/>schedule movement in this instance.</p>
<p>If the evaluator has recommended, and the employee has acted to seek remedial<br/>assistance, then the district shall grant professional growth credits for subsequent<br/>salary schedule movement, providing the member has borne whatever tuition and<br/>expenses that may have been required to receive college/university credits or their<br/>equivalents, and the provisions of Article XII have been met.</p>
<p>11.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If subsequent remedial action eliminates the negative evaluation and/or the identified<br/>deficiencies, the evaluation(s) citing such deficiencies shall have a notice to that<br/>effect attached to the member’s permanent personnel file with the report.</p>

<p>A unit member may utilize this Agreement’s grievance procedures for only disputes<br/>that may arise related to the evaluation procedures, but not any content of a report. A<br/>separate file shall contain such resolved grievance documents, and not become part of<br/>the member’s permanent personnel file.</p>
<p>The written evaluation report developed through use of the procedures previously<br/>listed shall be given to the member being evaluated no later than 30 days before the<br/>last school day. The member shall be given an opportunity to discuss it with the<br/>evaluator and to attach to the evaluation report any comments the member may wish<br/>to prepare. The written comments must be submitted within ten (10) working days of<br/>receipt of the evaluation report and shall become a permanent part of the member’s<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>Each member shall sign the evaluation report. However, such signature indicates that<br/>the evaluation report has been discussed with the member and does not necessarily<br/>constitute agreement with the judgment of the evaluator.</p>
