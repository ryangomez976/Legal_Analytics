<p>This Article does not apply to Head Start. For Head Start class/caseload refer</p>
<p>to Article 25.</p>
<p>23.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size/Caseload</p>
<p>23.1.1 All class size/caseload issues shall be reviewed at a meeting between<br/>Teacher and Administrators and may be requested by either party. At a<br/>minimum, a meeting to address class size/caseload issues or projections<br/>shall take place once at the beginning of the school year, and again in<br/>May to review plans for the extended year program, as well as the<br/>following academic year.</p>
<p>23.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All class size/caseloads shall be set after considering the following factors: type<br/>of service to include frequency and duration; student behavioral issues; mental<br/>health issues; student IEP and 504 plan requirements; adult support levels;<br/>physical environment considerations/limitations number of sites, travel distance<br/>to and between sites and the number of pending referrals. If at any time a unit<br/>member is impacted by his/her caseload/class size/workload due to the factors<br/>listed above, the unit member may request a meeting with his/her Administrator<br/>to discuss a reduction of the caseload/class size/workload or remedies for relief.</p>

<p>23.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Court and Community Schools, the flexibility provisions described<br/>below are contingent on the availability of adequate size classrooms at both the<br/>Court and Community Schools. Class size is determined by the number of<br/>students in teacher's classroom during the entire day.

<p>APPENDIX M</p>
<p>ARTICLE 23<br/>CLASS/CASELOAD SIZE<br/>STEPS IN A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS</p>
<p>Workload refers to all activities required and performed by school-based LSHSs. LSHS<br/>workloads include considerable time for face-to-face direct services to students. Workloads<br/>also include many other activities necessary to support students' education programs,<br/>implement best practices for school speech-language services, and ensure compliance with<br/>IDEA and other mandates.</p>
<p>Steps in a Workload Analysis</p>
<p>Step 1: Analyze the current workload relative to the needs of students receiving<br/>services.</p>
<p>An analysis of LSHS workloads requires detailed information on the services and tasks<br/>necessary to meet each student’s individual needs, the time it takes for each student-<br/>related service and activity, and the time available for these activities.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each student should have an appropriate intervention or service plan, or an IEP/IFSP<br/>with team consensus on appropriate communication goal(s) and service options. To<br/>carry out a workload analysis, LSHSs should determine the specific workload<br/>activities necessary to provide adequate services for every student for whom they<br/>are responsible. For the majority of students served by the LSHS, the activities<br/>necessary to support the education plan appropriately should occur across all four<br/>workload activity clusters.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurate information must be available on the amount of time spent on each<br/>workload activity for each student per school day, week, or month. Data from<br/>individual LSHSs or data aggregated across all LSHSs in a unit should be collected<br/>and analyzed.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school day or week has a fixed number of time slots available for LSHSs to<br/>fulfill the roles and responsibilities described above. A number of time slots must be<br/>used for activities that are mandated by federal and state rule and law (for example,<br/>compliance with timelines for notice and evaluation of students), or local education<br/>agency policies and procedures (for example, travel between buildings, student<br/>team meetings, and teacher planning periods during the students' school day). Time<br/>slots when students are not available for face-to-face services should be used to the<br/>greatest extent possible for these administrative and management activities.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining time slots will be filled with direct, indirect, and other activities from<br/>each workload cluster that are necessary to support the education of students who<br/>receive services from the LSHS. When all available time slots are filled, the<br/>caseload maximum has been reached for any individual LSHS. This<br/>maximum number will vary across settings and be a function of the needs<br/>of the specific students on the caseload, the time required to implement<br/>those activities, local logistic constraints (e.g., limitations on times<br/>teachers are free to collaborate and plan), and the amount of time<br/>available. Administratively convenient practices, such as serving more students by<br/>increasing intervention group sizes, are not appropriate if student needs are</p>

<p>July 1, 2011 - June 30, 2014</p>
<p>APPENDIX M</p>
<p>compromised and current research findings on the effects of caseload size are not<br/>considered.</p>
<p>Step 2: Is the workload balanced?</p>
<p>When all time slots are filled but required activities or student services remain unscheduled,<br/>an imbalance exists between the LSHS’s assigned workload and the amount of time<br/>available to fulfill those responsibilities. The LSHS and program administrator will meet to<br/>address the imbalance.</p>
<p>Workload Activity Clusters</p>
<p>The expanded scope of roles and responsibilities of school-based LSHSs can be better<br/>understood when they are organized into several major clusters of work activities.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct services to students including instruction, intervention, and<br/>evaluations.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus is on the direct (individual, small group, large group) implementation of<br/>IEPs/IFSPs</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial evaluations to identify students with disabilities</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reevaluation/Transition as required by federal and state special education<br/>regulations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingual evaluation</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAC evaluation</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAC direct service (individual, small group)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amended evaluation</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English Language Proficiency evaluation</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STAR Testing</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indirect services to students to support the implementation of students’<br/>education programs.</p>
<p>In addition to direct services, students with disabilities need multiple support activities from<br/>LSHSs in order to make progress on IEP/IFSP goals and generalize these skills to other<br/>environments. These activities are referred to as indirect services because they do not<br/>involve face-to-face contact with students, yet they are just as important to students'<br/>education programs as are face-to-face services.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Design, maintenance, programming, and staff training for augmentative &amp;<br/>alternative communication systems</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student-centered planning and collaboration with other teachers and professionals</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing &amp; preparing curriculum and instructional modifications</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving on student planning teams</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing student service plans</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting and analyzing student performance data</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating and meeting with parents and nonpublic school staff</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning for student transitions</p>
<p>MCOE/MCOETA Agreement</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>July 1, 2011 - June 30, 2014</p>
<p>APPENDIX M</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indirect activities that support students in the least restrictive environment<br/>and in the general education curriculum.</p>
<p>Students with identified disabilities require additional indirect services to ensure that they<br/>progress in the least restrictive environment and in the general education curriculum.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For students with IEPs, these activities require the LSHS to become familiar with all<br/>aspects of the general education curriculum</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet, consult, and collaborate with classroom teachers, paraprofessionals, and<br/>others who provide education services to students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom observations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher interviews</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying curriculum, and adapting instructional materials</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities that support compliance with federal, state, and local mandates<br/>and activities that result from membership in a community of educators.</p>
<p>A wide range of time-consuming activities in the workload of school LSHSs are required to<br/>comply with an expanding set of federal, state, and local mandates. Some of these<br/>responsibilities are administrative and management tasks.</p>
<p>Many of these compliance-related activities involve extensive documentation, and include<br/>numerous required written products such as:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student evaluation reports</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing IEPs/IFSPs,</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student progress reports</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily intervention charts and logs,</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third party billing statements and logs</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding reports for assistive technology</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student child count reports</p>
<p>Travel between schools, office and number of sites also can be considered to be a<br/>management activity that can add significantly to LSHSs' workloads.</p>
<p>This workload activity cluster can include activities and responsibilities that must be<br/>addressed simply because LSHSs are professional members of a school community.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LSHSs may need to participate in building staff meetings</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School or county committees</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance at IEP/IFSP meetings (Annual, triennial, addendums, transition,<br/>emergency, IFSP every 6 months)</p>
<p>Workload responsibilities such as:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program development</p>
<p>Service in professional organizations</p>
