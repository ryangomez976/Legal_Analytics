<p>ARTICLE 6<br/>AGENCY FEE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebate. Service fee payers are entitled to a rebate of the portion of fees which are not<br/>related to collective bargaining/representational duties, pursuant to state law.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious Objector. Any employee who is a member of a religious body whose<br/>traditional tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting<br/>employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support the Larkspur-<br/>Corte Madera Teachers Association/CTA/NEA as a condition of employment. However,<br/>such employee shall be required, in lieu of a service fee required by this agreement, to pay<br/>sums equal to such service fee to any non-religious, non-labor organization or charitable<br/>fund exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue<br/>Code that is located within California and whose goals and objectives are to assist and<br/>benefit children.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Philosophical/Personal Objector. Any employee who has strong personal and philosophic<br/>objections to joining or paying service fees to any employee organization shall not be<br/>required to join, maintain membership in, or pay service fees to the Larkspur-Corte<br/>Madera Teachers Association/CTA/NEA as a condition of employment. However, such<br/>employee shall be required to submit a written statement of his or her objection to the<br/>District and the Association and, within thirty (30) days of its receipt, to present the<br/>objection orally to a committee composed of one representative from LTA and the<br/>Superintendent. Objector status shall be approved if the committee is satisfied that the<br/>employee’s objection is sincerely believed and is in fact a personal and philosophic<br/>objection to joining or paying fees to any employee organization. The proceedings of the<br/>committee will be conducted according to procedures agreed to by the Association and<br/>the District. Once objector status is approved, such employee shall be required in lieu of<br/>a service fee required by this Agreement, to pay sums equal to such service fee to any<br/>non-religious, non-labor organization or charitable fund exempt from taxation under<br/>section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code that is located within<br/>California and whose goals and objectives are to assist and benefit children.</p>
<p>Proof of Payment (religious/philosophic/personal objector).

Such employee shall also furnish LTA with proof of<br/>the charity’s tax exempt status.</p>
<p>Hold Harmless. The Association agrees to pay to the District all reasonable legal fees and<br/>legal costs incurred in defending against any court action and/or administrative action<br/>challenging the legality or constitutionality of the Agency Fee provisions of this<br/>Agreement or their implementation. The Association shall have the exclusive right to<br/>decide and determine whether any such action of proceeding referred to above shall or<br/>shall not be comprised, resisted, defended, tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>Procedure For Personal and Philosophic Objection Committee.</p>
<p>Purpose: It is recognized that there may be individuals who hold personal and<br/>philosophic objections to joining or paying fees to any employee association. To<br/>accommodate these individuals, the objection committee has been created. It is not the<br/>purpose of the committee to agree or disagree with an individual’s objection. The<br/>purpose is to assure the respective Associations that the objection is sincere and genuinely<br/>held by the individual.</p>

<p>7.1 The committee will meet within thirty (30) days of the written request submitted<br/>by the applicant.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spokesperson for the committee will state the purpose of the meeting as<br/>presented here.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant will have an uninterrupted opportunity to present a statement of<br/>their personal and philosophic objection. The applicant is encouraged, if possible,<br/>to include examples of how this objection has been acted on in the past.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will have an opportunity to ask questions to clarify any points not<br/>clear in the applicant’s presentation.</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will present the procedures required of the applicant once objector<br/>status is granted as outlined in the contract. The rights of the applicant as a non¬<br/>member will also be outlined.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort should be made to conclude the meeting in a spirit of support and<br/>appreciation for the position of the applicant and his or her positive inclusion in<br/>the school community.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will meet immediately following to discuss the application and<br/>vote on its approval. A majority vote of the committee is final and binding on all<br/>parties.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candidate will be notified within ten (10) days as to the results of the vote.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>WORK YEAR</p>
<p>The work year for members of the bargaining unit shall consist of 187 work days. 180 of<br/>these days will be instructional days.
