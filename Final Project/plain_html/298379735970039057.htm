However, the site principal is not<br/>precluded from pursuing the underlying concerns raised in the complaint and conducting his/her own<br/>investigation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided by law or legal regulation, those involved shall<br/>receive written notification of the complaint or charge after it has been reduced to writing and<br/>submitted to the District.</p>

The term “resolution” as used in this section shall mean the resolution<br/>to the point that, neither the charging party, the unit member, nor the District wishes to pursue this<br/>issue to another level.</p>

<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the compensation to the arbitrator and the<br/>reimbursement of the arbitrator's travel and subsistence expenses, as well as the cost of a hearing<br/>room, will be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other cost will be borne by the<br/>party incurring the costs.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may present disputes in accordance with this Article without<br/>intervention of the Association, so long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this<br/>Agreement.

The Association shall either accept the resolution or appeal to the next level within ten</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the dispute involved an order, requirement, etc., pending the final<br/>decision of the dispute, the unit member dispute shall in no way interfere with the right of the<br/>District to proceed in carrying out its management responsibilities subject to final resolution of the<br/>dispute.</p>
