<p>4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average staffing ratios above shall not apply to Physical Education, Instrumental Music,<br/>Choral Music, Leadership, Theatre, and/or other similar programs. District will make a<br/>reasonable effort to avoid extremes in class sizes in these programs.</p>

<p>4.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher in the secondary school setting (6-12) shall not be required to maintain an assigned<br/>daily student contact total that exceeds the product of the applicable staffing ratio set forth<br/>above, multiplied by the number of teaching sections assigned to the teacher; except that a<br/>permanent teacher may agree to a higher number of total assigned daily student contacts.</p>

<p>A full-time unit member, covered by this Agreement, for a full contract year shall be<br/>annually entitled to ten (10) days of leave of absence for the purpose of sick leave utilization.</p>
<p>An employee, covered by this Agreement, working less than full-time shall be entitled to<br/>sick leave in the same ratio that his/her employment bears to full-time employment.</p>
<p>6.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>Each employee is personally responsible for reporting absences and return to work from<br/>absences. If you are unable to report for work call 962-5318 anytime during the day or night<br/>before you expect to be absent. Call as soon as possible. In the event of a system failure,<br/>employees are directed to contact their immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>6.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements</p>
<p>An employee becoming aware of the need for absence due to surgery, maternity, or other<br/>predictable or prior scheduled cause shall submit a statement from his/her attending<br/>physician as far in advance of the initial disability date as possible. The physician's statement<br/>shall include the beginning date of disability and the anticipated date of the return to active<br/>service. The District may require the employee to be examined by a District selected<br/>physician.</p>
<p>6.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation</p>

The amount of differential pay shall be<br/>the difference between the daily pay of the unit member and that of a substitute or, if<br/>no substitute is employed, the amount which would have been paid to the substitute<br/>had one been employed.</p>

<p>6.6.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee has exhausted all available sick leave, including accumulated sick<br/>leave, and continues to be absent on account of illness or accident for a period<br/>beyond the five (5) months of differential pay, and the employee is not medically<br/>able to resume the duties of his or her position, the employee, if not placed in<br/>another position, shall be placed on a reemployment list for 24 months (probationary<br/>employee) or 39 months (permanent employee).</p>
<p>6.6.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is medically able to return during the reemployment period, he or<br/>she shall present the physicians confirmation of such fact in order to be placed in a<br/>vacant position for which he/she is credentialed and qualified.</p>

<p>17.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request a voluntary transfer (unit member initiated transfer) to take<br/>effect at the beginning of the following school year or during the current school year when<br/>an opening becomes available. Transfer requests for the following school year will be<br/>accepted between April 1 and May 31. No transfer requests for the following school year<br/>will be accepted after May 31. The request shall be made on a “Request for Transfer<br/>Form” and sent to the Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>17.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member's request for transfer shall bear the signature of that unit member's present<br/>administrator. Such signature is an acknowledgment only that the administrator has been<br/>informed of the unit member's desire for transfer consideration. Such signature does not<br/>necessarily imply approval or disapproval of the administrator nor may the<br/>acknowledgment be withheld by the administrator. The filing of a request for transfer is<br/>without prejudice to the unit member. A request for transfer may be withdrawn by the<br/>unit member in writing at any time prior to official notification of transfer approval.

<p>A unit member shall not be overtly or indirectly pressured by the employer to seek a<br/>voluntary transfer.</p>
<p>If a voluntary transfer request is denied, the unit member shall be provided, upon request,<br/>with the specific reasons in writing, within a reasonable time after the appointment by the<br/>employer. No request shall be denied in a manner which is arbitrary, capricious or<br/>discriminatory.</p>

Involuntary transfers shall be considered on priority basis of the following:<br/>required certification, the preference of the unit member, the length of the service rendered<br/>to the District by the unit member (seniority), and additional qualifications the unit<br/>member can bring to the new assignment. The parties agree that, in the majority of<br/>ordinary instances of involuntary transfer, this would result in an involuntary transfer of<br/>the least senior unit member in the credential area in the school.</p>
<p>17.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-initiated transfers shall not be arbitrary or capricious, and shall require a<br/>reasonable basis or justification. District-initiated transfers shall not be punitive or<br/>disciplinary in nature in-and-of themselves, but may be incorporated as an element of<br/>disciplinary action under Article 28 of this Agreement. Section 17.4 is declaratory of the<br/>existing contract language, as clarified through a Settlement Agreement between the<br/>parties dated March 21, 2012.</p>
<p>17.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon administrative transfer/involuntary transfer during the school year, the bargaining<br/>unit member shall have access to a maximum of three (3) days (released time) to<br/>accomplish the move.</p>

<p>17.3.6</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>TAWC</p>
<p>17.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignments shall be based upon the required certification authorization, the preference<br/>of the unit member, the length of the service rendered to the District by the unit member,<br/>and additional qualifications the unit member can bring to the new assignment.</p>
<p>17.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-initiated reassignments shall not be arbitrary or capricious, and shall require a<br/>reasonable basis or justification. District-initiated reassignments shall not be punitive or<br/>disciplinary in nature in-and-of themselves, but may be incorporated as an element of<br/>disciplinary action under Article 28 of this Agreement. Section 17.5 is declaratory of the<br/>existing contract language, as clarified through a Settlement Agreement between the<br/>parties dated March 21, 2012.</p>
<p>17.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a reassignment is implemented or a request is denied, the unit member shall be<br/>provided, upon request, with the specific reasons in writing, within a reasonable time after<br/>reassignment or denial of the request by the employer.

<p>ARTICLE 28<br/>DUE PROCESS PROCEDURES</p>
<p>WCUSD</p>
<p>The Association and the District recognize the obligations of unit members to demonstrate<br/>professionalism in the course of their day-to-day duties. It is also important to establish<br/>procedures for the administration of constructive and progressive discipline under this article and<br/>to provide unit members with due process incorporating the principles of just cause.</p>
<p>This Article is separate and independent from, and does not affect the evaluation provisions of this<br/>Agreement, state law, statutory suspension, mandatory leaves, paid administrative leave, non¬<br/>reelection, notice of unsatisfactory performance and unprofessional conduct, or dismissal<br/>proceedings. Suspension under this Article shall not be regarded as a precondition for a statutory<br/>suspension or dismissal.</p>
<p>The unit member will be given timely notice when required to attend a meeting called by the<br/>District that may lead to discipline, and has the right to be represented by the Association in such<br/>meetings.</p>
<p>Action taken under this article shall be corrective and progressive, and reasonably related to the<br/>seriousness of the misconduct and the number and frequency of verifiable prior incidents of<br/>misconduct by the unit member.</p>
<p>Except as provided herein, prior to imposing suspension, the District will utilize the progressive<br/>corrective actions outlined in Steps 1-3 below. The Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources,<br/>based upon the serious or cumulative nature of the conduct may determine to skip step(s) regardless<br/>of the timing or occurrence of an earlier step. Such determination shall not be subject to the<br/>grievance procedure or to arbitration except as provided in section 28.6.7 of this Article.</p>
<p>28.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1 - Verbal Warnins</p>
<p>A verbal warning may be given to unit members for actions, omissions, or infractions that<br/>require remediation and shall state the administrator’s expectation/resolution. The<br/>administrator may make a summary notation of the meeting. A summary notation will be<br/>written and given to the member and such summary notation shall not be placed in the<br/>unit member’s personnel file. However, should further discipline be required, such<br/>notation shall be attached to written documentation and the unit member will be notified if<br/>the summary notation is to be placed in his/her personnel file.</p>
<p>28.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2 - Written Warning</p>
<p>28.5.2.1 Written warnings will not be used unless the unit member has been verbally<br/>warned about a separate action, infraction or omission within the last eighteen<br/>(18) calendar months</p>

However, should further<br/>discipline be required, such written warning shall be attached to written<br/>documentation and the unit member will be notified if the written warning is<br/>to be placed in his/her personnel file.</p>
<p>28.5.3 Step 3 - Written Reprimand</p>
<p>28.5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written reprimands will not be used unless the unit member has received a<br/>written warning about a separate action, infraction or omission within the last<br/>eighteen (18) calendar months</p>
<p>28.5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will sign the reprimand to acknowledge receipt and a copy<br/>may be placed in the unit member’s personnel file. A signature does not<br/>imply agreement.</p>
<p>28.5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has a right to attach a written response within ten (10)<br/>working days of receipt of the written reprimand.</p>
<p>28.5 .3 .4 If an administrator issues a Written Reprimand, the unit member may appeal<br/>by requesting a meeting within five (5) working days. The meeting shall take<br/>place within ten (10) working days of such request with a representative<br/>assigned by the Association and a representative assigned by the District to<br/>review the Written Reprimand. If the parties agree, the Written Reprimand<br/>may be rescinded or reduced and not placed in the unit member’s personnel<br/>file.</p>
<p>28.5.4 Step 4 - Suspension</p>
<p>28.5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be suspended without pay for a violation of a repetitive<br/>nature or serious misconduct.</p>
<p>28.5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in section 28.5, suspension without pay will not be used<br/>unless the unit member has within the last eighteen (18) calendar months been<br/>disciplined as provided in this Article.</p>
<p>28.5 .4.2 No initial suspension without pay shall exceed ten (10) working days, and no<br/>second suspension within 18 calendar months shall exceed twelve (12)<br/>working days.</p>
<p>28.6 NOTICE OF SUSPENSION</p>

A copy will be provided to the Association President with the consent of the unit<br/>member. If the unit member does not consent, the District shall notify the Association in<br/>writing that it has notified a member of suspension under this section.</p>

<p>28.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed suspension shall become final by: (a) the failure of the Association (or the<br/>unit member if not represented by the Association) to file a written appeal to the<br/>Superintendent within 10 working days of the receipt of the written notice of suspension;<br/>(b) within 10 working days of a meeting of the employee, the Association, if requested by<br/>the employee, and the Superintendent to discuss the proposed suspension; or (c) by<br/>decision of an arbitrator to whom the proposed suspension was appealed.</p>
