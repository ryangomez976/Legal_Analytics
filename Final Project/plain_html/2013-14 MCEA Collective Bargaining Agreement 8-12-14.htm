<p>-1-</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2</p>
<p>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent/Governing Board recognizes the Association as the exclusive<br/>representative for unit members in the certificated unit.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated unit consists of all certificated unit members excluding:</p>
<p>any position listed on the Administrative/Support Staff Salary Schedule,<br/>substitutes who are employed on a day-to-day hourly basis to replace<br/>absent teachers, casual teachers employed on a day or hourly basis,<br/>including, but not limited to, home/hospital instruction, Regional<br/>Occupational Program unit members who have other full-time<br/>employment, GED testers in the County Jail Program, and summer<br/>school employees.</p>
<p>-2-</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3</p>
<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a staff meeting prior to October 1, the immediate supervisor who is management will<br/>present and discuss the basis for establishing the posted hours of employment. This<br/>presentation will include items such as, but not limited to, student needs, transportation,<br/>host school schedule, need to consult with others, student contact hours, other issues.</p>
<p>3.1.1. The immediate supervisor who is management will ask for additional information<br/>which may affect the posted hours of employment.</p>
<p>3.1.2 In the event that there may be a potential change of hours, individual discussion<br/>about potential changes in hours will be held at the unit member’s request.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor who is management will determine and post unit members<br/>with hours of employment prior to October 1 of each year. In lieu or in addition to posting<br/>hours of employment unit members will receive a memo.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members may leave their sites of employment during the posted hours of<br/>employment with the approval of the immediate supervisor who is management.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members are entitled to an on-site 30 minute duty free lunch period<br/>scheduled as close to noon as possible.</p>
<p>3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of hours of part-time bargaining unit members will be determined by<br/>multiplying the percentage of service by the number of full-time posted hours at that site<br/>or in the case of multiple sites, by determining a weekly average based on the posted<br/>hours of full-time unit members who have similar assignments.</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent/Governing Board recognizes and appreciates that teachers spend<br/>many hours each year beyond the posted work hours in duties and activities that are in<br/>the best interest of their students and their profession. Such professional duties and<br/>activities may include, but are not limited to: staff meetings, annual reviews, intake<br/>interviews, conferences with other staff or professionals, liaison meetings with on-site<br/>schools, advisory committee meetings, parent conferences, employer contacts, inservice<br/>meetings, board meetings, and back to school nights.</p>
<p>3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized by both parties that posted hours of employment may result in disparate<br/>student contact time, on-site time, and professional responsibilities.</p>

If<br/>there are no unit member-initiated requests to transfer to the vacated<br/>position, the persons who are being considered by the administration for<br/>transfer into the vacated position will have all or most of the qualifications<br/>listed, and will be the lowest on the seniority list.</p>

If<br/>the Superintendent/Goveming Board physician's determination is contrary to the<br/>unit member's physician, the two physicians will select a third physician, whose<br/>cost is to be borne by the Superintendent/Goveming Board, to meet with them to<br/>determine whether the unit member is fit to return to duty.

<p>6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is disabled due to pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion,<br/>childbirth and recovery therefrom is entitled to use her accumulated disability or<br/>sick leave benefits and is entitled to other health or sick leave benefits as are<br/>received by other certificated unit members who are temporarily disabled, but<br/>only to the extent that such benefits are received by other temporarily disabled<br/>unit members.</p>
