<p>ARTICLE 9 - REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>9.1 Reassignment of Unit Members</p>
<p>Reassignment is a change of teaching assignment, such as grade level, discipline (e.g. English<br/>to mathematics), or change from a specialized assignment (e.g. media specialist to classroom<br/>teacher) at the same worksite.</p>
<p>For District-based programs, reassignment is a change of assignment within the total district-<br/>based program.</p>
<p>Unit members of district based programs (e.g. special education, elementary science, and<br/>elementary fine arts) assigned full-time to a specific school site shall be considered site staff<br/>for the purposes of reassignment to a vacancy occurring at that site.</p>
<p>9.1.1 Types of reassignment</p>
<p>9.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Member Initiated — The unit member requests reassignment.</p>
<p>9.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Initiated — Reassignment is necessitated because of a credentialing<br/>problem, return from leave, filling existing vacancies, a surplus situation,<br/>an emergency condition, or for the benefit of the school instructional<br/>program.</p>
<p>The site administrator may assign unit Members according to these<br/>provisions in spite of written requests for reassignment consideration on<br/>file. The site administrator shall justify such action in writing if requested.</p>
<p>In the event that the site administrator has not received any written requests<br/>for reassignment consideration, reassignments shall be considered district<br/>initiated.</p>

<p>ITA Agreement</p>
<p>July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013</p>
<p>reassignment prior to any commitment to the position. Requests for reassignment<br/>made during the spring shall remain valid through the close of the following school<br/>year. During non-school months, the site administrator shall make a reasonable<br/>attempt to contact those individuals who have submitted a written request for<br/>reassignment. If the administrator is unable to contact the unit member(s) then the<br/>administrator may proceed with the reassignment process.</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the responsibility of the unit member to make available to the<br/>administrator a method of communication with the unit member, should the unit<br/>member be away from home.</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for reassignment shall be submitted in writing to the building administrator<br/>within the time limit prescribed in order to be considered.</p>
<p>9.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a vacancy, unit members applying for reassignment shall be given<br/>first consideration. Unit member(s) not selected for the opening shall be notified<br/>prior to any announcement that the vacancy is filled or that the vacancy is being<br/>opened to other individuals.</p>
<p>9.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a reassignment is denied, upon request by the unit member, the<br/>administrator shall provide in writing the specific reason(s) for the denial.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Initiated Reassignment</p>

<p>All references to transfer may be read for the purpose of this article as reassignment.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member’s activity in the Association shall not be a factor in the consideration of a</p>
<p>reassignment at a site.</p>
<p>ITA Agreement<br/>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2013</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10 - WORKING CONDITIONS</p>
<p>The District recognizes the importance of unit member input. In order to facilitate unit member<br/>input, the District uses a participatory management system that values unit member participation in<br/>decisions. Special importance is placed on receiving unit member feedback on professional issues<br/>and professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Association shall have one seat on each Board-created advisory committee and shall select its<br/>committee member.</p>
<p>10.1 The District agrees to provide facilities, equipment, and a wholesome and functional<br/>environment for unit members and students.</p>

<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide designated on-campus parking for bargaining unit<br/>members assigned to a high school site.</p>
<p>10.2 The individual unit member instructional day will be differentiated by grade level. Unit<br/>members recognize their responsibility to their profession and will perform other duties<br/>outside the instructional day necessary to fulfill their obligations to the educational process.<br/>Such other duties are delineated within: 10.2.1, 10.2.2, 10.2.3, and 10.2.4.</p>
<p>Kindergarten<br/>Grades 1-3<br/>Grades 4-6<br/>Grades 7-8<br/>Grades 9-12</p>
<p>300 minutes<br/>285 minutes<br/>308 minutes<br/>280 minutes<br/>280 minutes</p>
<p>Worksites may deviate from these averages to allow the district to participate fully in the<br/>state funded staff development program and/or accommodate site decisions for minimum<br/>days.</p>
<p>10.2.1 Category 1: Instructionally Related Duties</p>
<p>Activities which are integrally connected by function or law to a unit member's<br/>instructional responsibility; by performing these duties the unit member facilitates,<br/>supports, or complements his/her instructional role. These activities are either: 1)<br/>associated with a particular unit member by virtue of the unit member’s<br/>instructional relationship with individual students; i.e. no other unit member could<br/>perform these functions because they are predicated on the individual unit<br/>member/student relationship; or 2) mandated by law; i.e. responsibilities<br/>enumerated or inferred in existing legal statutes or within this Agreement.</p>
<p>ITA Agreement</p>
<p>July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Instructionally related duties are implicitly assigned by the District through the<br/>vehicle of the unit member's employment.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of examples of instructionally- related duties is included in<br/>Appendix C of this Agreement.</p>
<p>10.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category 2: K-8 Supervision Duties</p>
<p>General supervision activities of more than a unit member's immediate class<br/>outside the instructional day, but within the school day, such as yard duty or bus<br/>duty.</p>
<p>10.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each K-8 unit member shall perform supervision duties during the year<br/>as assigned by the site manager. Up to twenty hours of such duty may be<br/>assigned as needed.</p>
<p>10.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During-the-day supervision responsibilities of the certificated staff shall<br/>be a site-based decision.</p>
<p>10.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the site manager determines that a temporary need exists<br/>for supervision duty during the duty-free lunch period, the site manager<br/>shall first request volunteers to perform such duties. If there are not a<br/>sufficient number of volunteers, the site manager shall assign and allocate<br/>such duties on an equitable basis. Unit members will be paid the<br/>certificated hourly rate to perform such supervision duties.</p>
<p>A non-exhaustive list of examples of supervision duties is included in<br/>Appendix C of this Agreement.</p>
<p>10.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 7-12 Advisement</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Administrators shall inform teachers on less than 100% contracts of<br/>the percent of contract at which the Advisement period is valued, and how<br/>that will/may further reduce their percent of contract, depending on their<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site by site information shall be posted on the Intranet and at each middle<br/>school site annually.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>ITA Agreement<br/>July 1, 2012 — June 30, 2013</p>
<p>10.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjunct duties are activities related to the curricular or extracurricular program, but<br/>not predicated on the particular knowledge of any particular student. These duties<br/>are a shared responsibility of all unit members at a site or in a District-based<br/>program and generally occur outside the school day.</p>
<p>Adjunct duties are a required part of the professional responsibilities of the<br/>teaching staff of the District. These duties shall be equitably assigned, based when<br/>possible on unit member preference, and will fall into the categories outlined in<br/>Appendix C.</p>
<p>Fulfilling one's adjunct duty requirement is typified by a District curriculum<br/>committee member who spends 6-8 hours in committee meetings and interacts<br/>with colleagues at the site regarding the work of the committee. This particular<br/>adjunct duty is the basis for defining an Adjunct Duty Equivalency (ADE). To<br/>assure equity, each unit member is responsible for an ADE that matches their full¬<br/>time employment equivalency (FTE) at the school.</p>
<p>The site or program administrator, with opportunity for staff input, shall develop<br/>annually the site list of adjunct duties from which ADE's can be built. Each of<br/>these duties shall be weighted as to its ADE, e g., the key leader in a non-review<br/>year might be weighted as one-half ADE. The site list of duties and their weights<br/>shall be posted by the site or program administrator not later than the second week<br/>of each school year. Subsequent to assignment, and by the end of the first month<br/>of school, the site or program administrator shall post the master list with the<br/>assignments designated.</p>
<p>The total number of adjunct duty equivalencies at a site shall not exceed the<br/>number of FTE's at that site.</p>
<p>10.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that unit members and support personnel normally work more than<br/>forty (40) hours per week. However, the work week for support personnel and<br/>classroom unit members shall be forty (40) hours, no less than thirty-five (35) of<br/>which shall be on site.</p>
<p>10.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the teaching staff minimum days shall be scheduled at each site<br/>on the days of Back-to-School and Open House nights.</p>
<p>10.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be on site a minimum of thirty (30) minutes before the school<br/>instructional day begins.</p>
<p>10.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be entitled to one duty-free uninterrupted lunch period each<br/>day. The lunch period shall be at least thirty (30) consecutive minutes, exclusive<br/>of passing periods.</p>

<p>Secondary Maximum Student Contract: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;187</p>
<p>10.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event enrollments occur which exceed the indicated limits for Grades K<br/>through 6, the site administrator and the affected unit member shall immediately<br/>proceed to develop a plan to redistribute students or provide support services<br/>and/or materials. Such plan shall be developed within seven (7) days and<br/>implemented within thirty-five (35) days following the first day of over¬<br/>enrollment.</p>
<p>10.4.3 In the event enrollments occur which exceed the Secondary Maximum Student<br/>Contract number, the site administrator and the affected unit member shall<br/>immediately proceed with the development of a plan to redistribute students so<br/>that the Secondary Maximum Student Contract number is not exceeded. In the<br/>alternative, the site administrator and the teacher may mutually agree to provide<br/>compensatory time up to a maximum of five (5) days per semester, or monetary<br/>compensation at the daily substitute rate or combination thereof, the total of<br/>which shall not exceed five (5) days per semester.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dates on which compensatory time will be taken shall be mutually agreed<br/>upon by the unit member and the site administrator.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any monies that are generated by the number of students over the<br/>Maximum Student Contract number in excess of the five (5) compensatory<br/>days and/or monetary compensation at the daily substitute rate shall be<br/>allocated for additional classroom support each semester. Such support<br/>shall be mutually agreed upon by the unit member and the site<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculation of the total allocation for additional classroom support, and/or<br/>compensatory time, and/or monetary compensation shall be based on the<br/>following formula:</p>
<p>Number of students over 187 X “excess student $ amount” * X 83 days<br/>(or the number of days prorated from the date of enrollment)</p>

<p>It is recognized by both the Irvine Teachers Association and the District that the San Joaquin<br/>High School program and Irvine Home School not only meets the needs of an important<br/>sector of the IUSD student population, but that they are separate and distinct programs<br/>requiring unique staffing and maximum flexibility in the certificated staff working<br/>conditions. As such, unit members in these programs shall be employed under the following<br/>guidelines:</p>
<p>14.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be assigned flexible work hours each week to provide<br/>maximum opportunity for student instructional opportunities as designated by the<br/>program to meet state and district requirements for students participating in such a<br/>program. These hours will vary as to time of day or evening according to student<br/>needs. Length of the day and the days per week will also vary according to student<br/>needs. Unit members shall be assigned forty (40) hours per week of student<br/>instructional time.</p>

<p>Article 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>
<p>Reassignment within the independent study program is defined as a<br/>change of assignment from independent study program teacher to a<br/>differentiated role such as lead teacher or outreach teacher. It is not a<br/>change of teaching position such as grade level or discipline.</p>

Additional days, not to exceed fifty (50), may be approved at the District's<br/>expense by the Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee.

<p>19.7.1 All applications for sabbatical leave shall be submitted to the Human Resources<br/>Office and shall include evidence that leave will be for the purpose of professional<br/>improvement and the development of concepts and materials which will benefit the<br/>curriculum of the District.

<p>ITA Agreement</p>

<p>The above may be combined with one (1) calendar month of travel being<br/>considered as equivalent to two (2) semester units when in combination<br/>with study.</p>
<p>19.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit member is eligible to apply for sabbatical leave who has served the District<br/>for seven (7) consecutive years. Authorized leaves shall not constitute a disruption<br/>of consecutive years of service accruing toward the sabbatical leave requirements.</p>

<p>19.7.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application for sabbatical leave shall be considered only in case<br/>his/her teaching for the last three years has been determined as<br/>satisfactory. It shall be understood, however, that sabbatical leave is not<br/>a reward for meritorious work already performed, but rather is to be<br/>looked upon as an opportunity to prepare for improved service in<br/>subsequent years. Its granting, therefore, should not be regarded as an<br/>indication of the quality of service by a unit member. Evaluation and<br/>recommendation of application shall be made by the Professional Growth<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>19.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave may be granted for a period of not less than one full semester and<br/>not more than two full semesters.</p>

The report should give a detailed account of the<br/>educational experiences upon which the request for benefits was based.</p>
<p>This statement not only shall include a detailed account of the experience upon<br/>which the request was based, but must give concrete evidence of specific ways in<br/>which this experience contributed to the improvement of the educational program.</p>

<p>IT A Agreement<br/>July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013</p>
<p>ADDENDUM</p>
<p>STATEMENTS OF MUTUAL RECOGNITION AND MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The negotiations process offers an opportunity to delineate a variety of potential problems and agree<br/>on directions for guidance in areas where specific contractual solutions would be restrictive. Both<br/>parties acknowledge that the best solution to a problem is often specific to the situation, but that both<br/>teachers and administrators could benefit from reference to mutually derived positions for<br/>clarification purposes in deriving such a solution.</p>
<p>The following statements are offered as a common ground between the parties to serve as guidance<br/>for teachers and administrators. They are presented here for ease of reference purposes only. The<br/>entire contents of this Addendum are not a part of the contract and are not subject to the grievance<br/>process allowed for in contractual disputes.</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>It is recognized by all educators that optimal learning is facilitated by class sizes lower than the<br/>norms within the State of California. However, the high cost of significantly lowering class size is<br/>also recognized. Although there are contractual limitations on class size, instances may occur where<br/>student enrollment in a class may be excessively high. At grades 7-12, the District will make every<br/>attempt to limit class size to 35. Special circumstances may occur when a teacher and the school<br/>agree to exceed the contractual limit of 187 students per teacher. In such cases, additional support, if<br/>any, will be provided within the resources of the school.</p>
<p>In such cases where it may be extremely difficult to monitor individual student progress or meet<br/>individual student needs, it is the mutual responsibility of the teacher and the administrator to<br/>develop a plan which will allow for the maximum learning and teaching to occur.</p>
<p>DISTRICT POLICY</p>
<p>The Board of Education acknowledges it's obligation to propose and establish policies for the<br/>District, to direct the administration to disseminate such policy to the school sites and the<br/>Association, and to manage the District in accordance with such policies.</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP INFORMATION</p>
<p>ITA recognizes its responsibility to make information available to teachers regarding the benefits of<br/>membership in the Association.</p>
<p>The IUSD Human Resources Department acknowledges its responsibility to provide new employees<br/>with information concerning their membership in the Association.</p>
<p>NUTRITION BREAK</p>
<p>It is mutually recognized that between the start of the school day and their lunch time, teachers may<br/>require a break to attend to personal needs. Administrators and teachers acknowledge their<br/>obligation to work with one another in consideration of such needs.</p>
<p>ITA Agreement</p>
<p>July 1, 2012 -June 30, 2013</p>
<p>PARTIAL CONTRACTS</p>
<p>In accepting or seeking a partial contract assignment, a teacher may reasonably expect that the non-<br/>instructional obligations attached to such an assignment will be commensurate with the percentage<br/>proportion of the contract itself.</p>
<p>In the matter of secondary class loads, the administrator will attempt to assign a student load<br/>commensurate with the percentage portion of the teacher's contract.</p>
<p>Administrators, with input from the teacher, will also attempt to keep the time that the teacher is<br/>required to be on the site commensurate with the percentage portion of the teacher's contract by<br/>assigning consecutive periods wherever possible.</p>
<p>SECONDARY CLASS PREPARATIONS</p>
<p>Both parties recognize that the secondary teacher's class assignments generally require no more than<br/>three different preparations. It is also recognized that in cases where teachers are involuntarily<br/>assigned to more than three preparations, their teaching effectiveness may be reduced. It is therefore<br/>agreed that every attempt will be made to keep a secondary teacher's class preparation at a maximum<br/>of three.</p>
<p>K-6 MEDIA SPECIALISTS</p>
<p>It is recognized as desirable that each school site employ a certificated library/media specialist to<br/>enhance the school's educational program.</p>
<p>TEACHER SAFETY</p>
<p>It is recognized by both parties that teachers have a responsibility to be prudent in the time and<br/>location they spend at the school site beyond the instructional or work day. Both parties also<br/>recognize the District's responsibility to provide facilities which ensure teacher and student safety.</p>
<p>PERSONNEL FILES</p>
<p>It is recognized that every employee has the right to examine his/her files upon request in<br/>accordance with the Education Code. The teachers recognize their responsibility to respect the time<br/>and task constraints of the personnel employee to whom the request is made.

<p>APPENDIX &quot;B-l&quot;</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay Formula (K-8)</p>
<p>A teacher shall receive one share per student worked with based on a six-week commitment, 1 and<br/>1/2 hours per day (outside of the student day), working on a four-day week with a maximum of<br/>eighteen weeks.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletics Pay Formula (9-12)</p>
<table border="1">

<p>Formula</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>1. Teachers who hold two coaching positions (Paid<br/>on June 1 warrant.)</p></td><td>
<p>60 shares</p></td></tr>

<p>2. A coach who serves as a Varsity Head Coach for<br/>both boys' and girls' sports in the same season</p></td><td>

</table>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletic Director receives 5% more than highest paid coach on his/her staff.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletic Trainer receives 70% of Boys' Athletic Director.</p>
<p>Agreements Relative to Interpretation of Athletics Pay Formula (9-12)</p>
<p>The Athletics Pay Formula is designed primarily for use with the computation of Head Coach<br/>stipends, and not with other non-athletic activity assignments.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Activity</p>
<p>Length of season is based on the current C.I.F. Blue Book dates. In the event a season extends<br/>over a vacation period, those weeks are counted, if the team either practices or performs during<br/>the vacation period. This factor does not include post-season CIF weeks (see #12).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Assistants. Direct Work with Head (Paid Adult)</p>
<p>Number of assistants refers strictly to the category of coach called Varsity Assistant (those<br/>coaches who work directly with the Varsity Head Coach during practices and games). Not<br/>included in this category are the heads of J.V. teams, nor assistants at the lower levels.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Responsibility. ASB and School</p>
<p>Included in this category is budget for which the head coach is responsible. Such items might<br/>include equipment, supplies, cleaning of uniforms reconditioning of equipment, scouting costs,<br/>and film service.</p>
<p>Not included in this category are coaching stipends, the cost of officials, nor other items<br/>typically handled by the athletic directors.</p>
<p>ITA Agreement</p>
<p>July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2013</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Major Performances</p>
<p>The number of major performances is defined in the C.I.F. Blue Book. We included only those<br/>performances that occurred during the season.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue-Producing Capabilities (Gate! Average per Performance</p>
<p>Revenue refers to total gate receipts for home events only, regardless of the school's share of the<br/>gate receipts.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number Participants per Paid Adult Assistant</p>
<p>As in Item #2, Paid Adult Assistant refers to paid varsity assistants only.</p>
<p>The number of participants refers to those participants during the season, not participants during<br/>practices outside the regular season. A clean way to determine the number of season participants<br/>is to count the names on the list of the program printed for the season's first performance. Divide<br/>number of participants by number of paid adult assistants.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Exposure</p>
<p>Public exposure refers to a combination of factors, such as the number of spectators at<br/>performances, relationships to parent booster clubs, and general school/community pressure to<br/>win.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No In-School Time for Activity</p>
<p>No in-school time means that the staff member does not receive a coaching period as one of the<br/>five periods normally awarded to teaching.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers Who Hold Two Supplementary (Coaching Only') Positions</p>
<p>Supplementary positions refers to those positions for which a stipend is awarded; and is awarded<br/>only one time (maximum) per person, per school year.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches Who Coach at the Site Where They Teach</p>
<p>In the case of classified personnel or long-term substitute teachers, this item also applies to full¬<br/>time personnel who coach at the site where they work.</p>
<p>This includes teachers, but excludes classified personnel, who work in the district, but who teach<br/>or work at a site different from the one where they coach.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varsity Head of both Bovs and Girls</p>
<p>This can happen only in the sports of cross country, track and swimming.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Season Weeks</p>
<p>This works on the same basis as a per diem for extra work, except this is per week. For example,<br/>if the length of season is 10 weeks, and the coach's stipend (Items 1-11) is $1,000, the coach<br/>would receive for each additional week, the result obtained by dividing the stipend ($1,000) by<br/>the weeks/season (10), or $100.00.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set contribution rates for employees</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make plan modifications</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is responsible for the daily administration of the benefits program</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BMB shall include representation from all District employee groups. The</p>
