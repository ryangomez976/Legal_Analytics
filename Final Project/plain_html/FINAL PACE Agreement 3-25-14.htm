<p>8.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance file shall be maintained in the central Human Resources Department and shall be<br/>separate from the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX - WORK HOURS AND WORK YEAR</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “full-time” unit member will work 185 days (180 student contact days, 2 teacher workdays and 3 staff<br/>development days). Should the Instructional Time and Staff Development Reform Program (SB 1193)<br/>funds for staff development be terminated or significantly modified, the parties will renegotiate the work<br/>year and salary related to these three days before the effective date of any such termination or<br/>modification. In the event any day has not been worked in a given school year and the funding for any<br/>day for that school year is at all decreased, following notice to bargaining unit members, the salary<br/>schedule and work year will be reduced by the amount of the funding decrease.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County Office and Association recognize that the varying nature of a unit member’s day-to-day<br/>professional duties, as described below, lends itself to the establishment of a workday with a defined<br/>length but which is also flexible to accommodate the unique needs of the st udents served by the County<br/>Office. A regular workday for all unit members shall consist of 7'A hours. The regular workday will<br/>begin 30 minutes before the student day and end 30 minutes after student departure (but shall not exceed<br/>I'A hours on a regular basis). The length of a regular workday, the starting and ending times, will be<br/>flexible to accommodate school site schedules greater or less than 1'A hours, itinerant schedules, and to<br/>accommodate time worked by unit members beyond eight hours in a given day due to work in either<br/>IEP/SST team meetings or home visits approved by the unit member’s supervisor.</p>
<p>9,2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit member working less than 1.0 FTE, shall have their</p>
<p>work hours assigned with consideration of, but not limited to, travel time, breaks,<br/>lunches, and scheduling of services.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are responsible for the following professional duties: 1EP team meetings including<br/>preparation, Back to School Night; Open House; County Office staff meetings of reasonable frequency<br/>and length; home visits; and Student Study Team meetings. Unit members are encouraged, but not<br/>required, to attend applicable school site staff meetings as part of their professional duties.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition that some unit members’ assigned duties may exceed the regular workday, the County<br/>Office will administer a flexible scheduling program which shall credit a unit member for work performed<br/>beyond 8 hours a day due to attendance at IEP team meetings (including IEP pre-conference meetings and<br/>approved web-based IEP preparation time), SST meetings, pre-approved home visits, pre-approved IEP<br/>report writing and any mandatory trainings. Work hour flexibility may be scheduled during, but not<br/>limited to, the following times: school district or County Office minimum days; before student arrival or<br/>after student departure; during part of a teacher workday; and preapproved for an entire workday.<br/>Flexible hours worked in activities that cause the regular workday to exceed eight hours shall not<br/>accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduling of work hour flexibility shall be undertaken as follows: at the beginning of each school<br/>year, and as needed throughout the year, the unit member and his/her supervisor shall meet to establish a<br/>work year calendar, which shall include flexible time scheduled to use for any work hours earned by a<br/>unit member who works beyond eight hours a day due to the above-listed activities. Whenever possible<br/>for unit members on itinerant schedules, the scheduling of minimum days will be aligned with a particular<br/>school district’s calendar. Additional methods for providing work hour flexibility may be agreed upon by<br/>the unit member and his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members, as part of their workday, shall be entitled to a thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch period, or<br/>duty-free school-scheduled lunch period, whichever is longer. Consistent with state law, the lunch period<br/>may be scheduled at any time during the regular teacher workday.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>9.7 All qualified bargaining unit members who request to be considered for annual opportunities for<br/>additional contract work in Alternative Education beyond 185 days per year, will be considered with<br/>priority given to the classroom’s incumbent teacher. In the event the incumbent teacher declines the<br/>additional contract work, the additional work will be offered first to the Alternative Education staff with<br/>consideration given to continuity of program and seniority.</p>
<p>ARTICLE X - PERSONNEL RECORDS</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel Files</p>
<p>10.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee shall maintain personnel records for all current and<br/>former employees. Official employee files shall be maintained at the County Office central office in the<br/>Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All personnel files are confidential and shall be available only to the unit member, persons<br/>authorized by the unit member, the Superintendent, and those authorized by the Superintendent with the<br/>knowledge of the unit member. The contents of all personnel files shall be kept in strict confidence by<br/>any authorized reviewer.

<p>11.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members employed five days per week are entitled to 10 days leave of absence<br/>for personal illness or injury (sick leave) per school year, with full pay. Unit members working less than<br/>five days per week shall be granted comparable sick leave in proportion to the time they work.</p>
<p>11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may take sick leave at any time during the school year, even if credit for sick<br/>leave has not yet been accrued.</p>
<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused days of sick leave shall be accumulated from year to year without limitation.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>11.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member who leaves the County Office after at least one year of<br/>employment and accepts a certificated position in another district, county office of education or<br/>community college district within one year shall have transferred with him/her the total amount of<br/>accumulated sick leave. The County Office may not require new employees to waive their leave<br/>accumulated in a previous district.</p>
<p>11.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave may be used by unit members for:</p>
<p>11.1.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases of temporary inability to perform duties because of illness, accident or<br/>quarantine, whether or not the cause of absence arises out of and in the course of employment.</p>
<p>11.1.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences due to pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery.</p>
<p>11.1.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases of personal necessity.</p>

<p>11.1.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic use for immediate family.</p>
<p>11.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall notify the County Office of his/her need to be absent as soon as such need<br/>is known, so that substitute services may be secured. This notification shall include an estimate of the<br/>expected duration of absence. If the absence becomes longer than estimated, the member shall so notify<br/>the County Office. If the duration of absence becomes shorter than estimated, the member shall notify the<br/>County Office no later than 3 p.m. of the day preceding that day on which he/she intends to return to<br/>work.</p>
<p>11.2 Sick Leave Beyond 10 Days</p>
<p>11.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave, including all accumulated sick<br/>leave, and continues to be absent from his/her duties due to illness or accident for an additional period up<br/>to five school months, the unit member shall receive his/her regular salary minus the actual cost of a<br/>substitute to fill the position. If the County Office has made every reasonable effort to secure the services<br/>of a substitute and have been unable to do so, the amount that might have been paid to a substitute shall be<br/>deducted from the unit member’s salary.</p>
<p>11.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month period shall run<br/>consecutively.</p>
<p>11.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not be provided more than one five-month period per illness or accident.<br/>However, if the school year ends before the five-month period is exhausted, the unit member may take the<br/>balance of the five-month period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>11.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five months, if a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave and is not medically<br/>able to resume his/her duties, the unit member shall be placed either in another position or on a<br/>reemployment list. If the unit member is on probationary status, he/she shall be placed on the<br/>reemployment list for 24 months beginning at the expiration of the five-month period provided pursuant<br/>to Education Code 44977. If on permanent status, the unit member shall be placed on the reemployment<br/>list for 39 months. If during this time the unit member becomes medically able, he/she shall be returned<br/>to employment in a position for which he/she is credentialed and qualified.</p>
<p>11.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After any absence due to illness or injury, the unit member shall verify the absence by<br/>submitting a completed and signed County Office absence form to his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>11.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee may require additional written verification by the unit<br/>member’s physician or practitioner. Such verification shall be required whenever a member’s absence<br/>record shows chronic absenteeism or a pattern of absences immediately before or after weekends and/or<br/>holidays or whenever clear evidence indicates that an absence is not related to illness or injury.</p>
<p>11.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee may require the unit member to visit a physician<br/>selected by the County Office and at County Office expense in order to receive a report on the medical<br/>condition of the member. The report shall include a statement as to the unit member’s need for further</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>leave of absence and a prognosis for when the member will be able to return to work. If the report<br/>concludes that the unit member’s condition does not warrant continued absence, the Superintendent may,<br/>after giving notice to the unit member, deny further leave.</p>
<p>11.2.8 Before returning to work, a unit member who has been absent for surgery, hospitalization or<br/>extended medical treatment may be asked to submit a letter from his/her physician stating that he/she is<br/>able to return and stipulating any recommended restrictions or limitations.</p>
<p>11.3 Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic Leave” means leave for a catastrophic illness or injury:</p>
<p>11.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is expected to incapacitate the receiving employee for an extended period of<br/>time beyond the employee’s paid leave entitlement; or,</p>
<p>11.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That incapacitates a member of the employee’s immediate family, which<br/>incapacity requires the employee to take unpaid time off from work for an extended period of<br/>time beyond the employees paid leave entitlement to care for that family member; and,</p>
<p>11.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would create a financial hardship for the receiving employee if he/she were<br/>required to take extended time off work because he/she has exhausted all of his or her sick<br/>leave and other paid time off.</p>
<p>11.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may donate up to the current year’s entitlement of sick leave to another unit<br/>member who meets the criteria above. If a donating unit member has accrued 50 or more days of sick<br/>leave, he/she may donate an additional year’s entitlement of sick leave to the receiving unit member.</p>
<p>11.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To donate sick leave, a unit member must retain one year’s entitlement of sick leave on the<br/>books.</p>
<p>11.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A donating employee may donate a minimum of 1 day of sick leave hours to another employee<br/>who has been deemed eligible to receive this leave.</p>
<p>11.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated sick leave hours shall be converted for utilization on an hour for hour basis meaning<br/>the recipient shall be paid at his regular rate of pay,</p>
<p>11.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office will credit the receiving employee’s sick account with one day of sick leave from<br/>each donating employee in the order in which the office receives the donation. This process will continue,<br/>if necessary, until the receiving employee has received the maximum days as established below. If,<br/>through the initial process of deducting one day of sick leave credit from each donating employee, the<br/>receiving employee does not receive sufficient sick leave credit, the office shall repeat the process by<br/>crediting the receiving employee’s account with additional sick leave credits from those employees who<br/>wish to donate more than one day of sick leave credit.</p>
<p>11.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may not revoke their donation of sick leave credits. Nevertheless, donated leave<br/>not utilized by the recipient prior to return to service shall be returned to the donor.</p>
<p>11.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum days allowed to be utilized by one employee shall not exceed the number of<br/>days in one work year. These days shall only be used during the regular school year.</p>
<p>11.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are granted the use of donated leave days shall be considered to be in regular<br/>paid status and will continue to earn and accrue all contractual and statutory benefits.</p>
<p>11.3.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To utilize this benefit, any certificated employee, unit member or County Office administrator<br/>or manager may submit a request to the Superintendent to “call for donations.”</p>
<p>11.3.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent will grant approval of a catastrophic leave request to an employee if the<br/>employee’s or their family member’s illness or injury conforms to the definitions of catastrophic illness or<br/>injury set forth in this section and the individual’s condition is verified by a physician’s written statement.<br/>Once the Superintendent approves the catastrophic leave request, the employee must exhaust all of his or<br/>her own sick leave entitlement before donated leave will be utilized.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>11.3.12 Any employee returning from catastrophic leave will be reinstated to their former position. An<br/>employee on catastrophic leave for his/her own serious health condition is required to provide a fitness-<br/>for-duty certificate from their physician before he/she will be reinstated to employment.</p>

Unless<br/>circumstances prevent it, such notice shall be provided to Human Resources at least four weeks prior to<br/>such anticipated commencement of leave.</p>

<p>11.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity leave shall be without pay. The unit member may receive compensation from other<br/>sources such as unused sick leave, substitute differential pay, disability insurance, and/or any other source<br/>of income available. Sick leave may not be taken during the period of time a unit member is on maternity<br/>leave, unless the sick leave is for the condition of pregnancy, or the recovery from childbirth. The use of<br/>sick leave shall be verified by a physician or medical practitioner that the unit member is no longer able to<br/>work due to the condition of pregnancy, miscarriage, or the recovery from childbirth.</p>
<p>11.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of maternity leave, including the date on which the leave is to begin and the date on<br/>which duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the unit member and her physician or medical<br/>practitioner.</p>

The amount paid will not exceed the amount paid for employee only coverage of<br/>regular active employees of the office.</p>
<p>15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County Office shall provide payment of health insurance coverage up to $410 for all eligible retired<br/>bargaining unit members only (single-person coverage) upon entering STRS/PERS following the<br/>completion of fifteen (15) consecutive years of service prior to the date of retirement. Retirees are not<br/>eligible for County paid dental coverage insurance; however, they may elect coverage on a cost-recovery<br/>basis. The retiree may continue dependent coverage provided the retiree pays his/her share of medical<br/>premium a month or more in advance.</p>
<p>15.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning July 1, 1990, new hires will not be eligible for paid health coverage for retirees as provided in<br/>this section. Unit members retiring from the County Office who are not eligible for paid coverage may<br/>pay health insurance premiums to the appropriate carrier through the County Office Human Resources<br/>Department. These payments must be made on a monthly prepayment basis.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>15.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insurance shall provide full benefits for eligible retired unit members up to the age at which they<br/>become eligible for Medicare/Medicaid, and afterwards shall cover only those eligible expenses not<br/>covered by Medicare/Medicaid, or other health insurance programs. Retired unit members and eligible<br/>spouses who choose to participate in the health insurance program shall be charged according to the<br/>following regulations.</p>
<p>15.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Retiring&quot; means receiving retirement benefits from STRS/PERS.</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive these benefits, a unit member must be eligible and apply within sixty (60) days of retirement<br/>from the County Office.</p>
<p>15.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of July 1, 1996, the County Office adopted tiered rates for eligible retirees and spouses. Tiered rates<br/>are available in all offered medical plans. Retiree and spouse age and Medicare enrollment status will<br/>determine the appropriate tier.</p>
<p>15.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those retirees who do not elect to continue dependent coverage, the County Office shall pay the full<br/>amount of the medical premium up to $410. The retiree shall be responsible for the balance of the<br/>premium over the current medical cap.</p>
<p>15.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those retirees who elect to include an eligible spouse for health coverage, the health and welfare<br/>premiums shall be prorated. The retiree will be responsible for the difference between the single and<br/>spouse rate for coverage.</p>
<p>15.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current medical cap and medical plan rate schedules are available in the County Office Human Resources<br/>Department.</p>
<p>15.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage under this program will continue only as long as the retiree reimburses the County Office<br/>his/her share of the medical premium on a monthly prepayment basis. Failure to make payment will<br/>result in termination of benefits.</p>
<p>15.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees that discontinue coverage cannot reenroll in any plan even during open enrollment. The &quot;break<br/>in coverage&quot; regulation does not apply. Retirees may select medical coverage only, or all offered<br/>benefits. Retirees may not select dental or vision coverage without medical coverage. Retirees are not<br/>eligible for SIG sponsored group life insurance coverage.</p>
<p>15.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At age 65, covered retirees and their spouses eligible for Medicaid benefits must report to the County<br/>Office upon obtaining eligibility for such benefits.

<p>ARTICLE XIX - COMPLAINTS</p>
<p>19.1 The County places trust in its employees and desires to support their actions in such manner that unit<br/>members are freed from unwarranted or spiteful criticism and complaints. No negative and/or<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation, assignment, discipline, dismissal or other adverse action shall be taken predicated</p>
<p>upon complaints, information or material of a derogatory or critical nature which has been received by the<br/>County from pupils, parents, county employees, public agency, and/or the public, unless the following<br/>procedures have been followed.</p>
<p>19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actionable complaints against unit members must be in writing and must specify the reason for the<br/>complaint and the circumstances surrounding any incidents involving the complaint. Complaints will be<br/>directed to the supervisor of the unit member named in the complaint.</p>

<p>19.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If appropriate, the supervisor will encourage the complainant to meet with the unit member to attempt an<br/>informal resolution. At the request of the unit member, and with the consent of the complainant,<br/>association representatives(s) may be present at the meeting. If the matter is not resolved through a<br/>meeting process to the satisfaction of the complainant, or if the complainant and unit member do not meet<br/>to attempt an informal resolution, the unit member shall be afforded the opportunity to review the written<br/>complaint and prepare a response.</p>
<p>19.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints which are withdrawn, shown to be false, or are not sustained through investigation shall neither<br/>be placed in the unit member’s personnel file nor utilized in any evaluation, assignment, or disciplinary or<br/>dismissal action against the unit member.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XX - ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of the Association, an Agency fee payer of the Association, or who has<br/>applied to the Association for religious objector status, may sign and deliver to the County Office an<br/>assignment authorizing deduction of unified membership dues, initiation fees, and general assessments in<br/>the Association or agency fees as provided for below. Unit members who currently have authorization<br/>cards on file for the above purpose need not be re-solicited. Pursuant to such authorization, the County<br/>Office shall deduct from the unit members as provided for above, in accordance with the dues and/or fee<br/>schedule(s) provided to the County Office by the Association, one-tenth of such dues/fees from the regular<br/>salary check of the teacher each month for ten months. Deductions for unit members who sign such<br/>authorization after the commencement of the school year shall be appropriately prorated to by the end of<br/>the school year.</p>
<p>20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the individual decision of each unit member whether to join the Association. A unit member shall<br/>have the right to terminate his or her membership in the Association on or before September 30 of each<br/>new school year.</p>
<p>20.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the Association, or who does not make application within 30<br/>days from the date of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit, shall become a member<br/>of the Association or pay to the Association a fee in an amount equal to membership dues, initiation fees<br/>and general assessments, payable to the Association in the same manner as required for the payment of<br/>membership dues. Such fee, as imposed by the Association, shall be calculated by the Association. In the<br/>event that a unit member does not pay such fee directly to the Association, the Association shall so inform<br/>the County Office who shall begin, in accordance with the dues and/or fee schedule(s) provided to the<br/>County Office by the Association, automatic payroll deduction in the same manner as set forth in this<br/>Article. There shall be no charge to the Association for such mandatory agency fee deductions.</p>
<p>20.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who qualified as a religious objector, shall not be required to join or financially support<br/>the Association as a condition of employment; except that such unit member shall pay, in lieu of a service</p>
<p>fee, sums equal to such service fee to one of the following non-religious, non-labor organization, charitable<br/>funds exempt from taxation under Section 500 (c)(3) of title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home Start, Inc.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placer Adults Literary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace for Families</p>
<p>Religious objector status is a determination made between the bargaining unit member and the Association.</p>
<p>20.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the County Office pursuant to sections above, whether for<br/>membership dues or agency fee, or religious objector status, the County Office agrees to remit such moneys<br/>to the Association in a timely manner accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members for whom such<br/>deductions have been made.</p>
<p>20.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to indemnify and hold the County Office harmless against any reasonable legal<br/>fees, legal costs, and settlement or judgment liability arising from any court or administrative action<br/>relating to the County Office’s compliance with this Article. The Association shall have the exclusive right<br/>to determine whether any such action or proceeding shall or shall not be resisted, defended, tried or<br/>appealed. This indemnification and hold harmless duty shall not include actions related to compliance with<br/>this Article brought by the Association.</p>
<p>20.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the County Office’s payroll procedure with respect to this Article may be subject to a grievance filed<br/>by a unit member and/or by the Association.</p>
<p>20.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the requirement established by Senate Bill 1960 (Burton) of mandatory agency fees following<br/>notice by the exclusive representative is repealed, the parties agree to renegotiate the agency fee<br/>requirement in Section C above.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXI - ADVANCEMENT ON THE SALARY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>21.1 All unit members shall advance one (1) vertical step on the salary schedule for each year of service, except<br/>those whose placement is at the maximum step for their class, within the limits of “Appendix B -<br/>Certificated Salary Schedule,” on July l<sup>sl</sup> of the next school year provided the time worked is equal to or<br/>more than 75% of the current school year,</p>
<p>21.2 Effective July 1, 2007 all part-time bargaining unit members working less than 75 percent of the days in<br/>one school year shall advance on step/column upon working the equivalent of 75 percent within a “rolling<br/>year”. A rolling year shall be established for all bargaining unit members with part-time assignments<br/>working less than 75 percent of each school year. The rolling year means the part-time days worked in one<br/>school year shall cumulate with the part-time days worked in the following school year until 75 percent of<br/>the prior year has been completed. Bargaining unit members must work in part-time assignments in<br/>consecutive years in order to continue cumulating days from school year to school year, equal to 75<br/>percent. For example a unit member working 60 percent of the first school year will not advance until the<br/>unit member works an additional 15 percent in the second school year. Advancement shall take place upon<br/>completion of 75% of each “rolling year” effective the pay period immediately following that unit<br/>member’s completion of said 75 percent. The unit member working 60 percent will continue to work the<br/>remaining 45 percent in the second school year and will not advance until the unit member works an<br/>additional 30 percent of the following school year (year 3), establishing a “rolling year”. The remaining 45<br/>percent would count toward the next movement the following school year (year 4). Any bargaining unit<br/>member working greater than 75 percent in one school year shall advance on the salary schedule at the<br/>beginning of the following school year.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>21.3 All employees are encouraged to improve their proficiency through study. Approved courses completed at<br/>an accredited college or university will be credited to the individual for salary advancement purposes.<br/>Units may be obtained by taking a course from an accredited college or university or through County<br/>Office approved in-service programs. Employees enrolled in advanced degree or required<br/>credential/waiver programs may seek approval to enroll and receive credit for a maximum of fifteen (15)<br/>semester units per fiscal year.</p>
<p>Credit for advancement on the salary schedule will only be given for those units earned after one of the<br/>following conditions is met:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granting of a BA Degree, or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granting of a vocational designated subjects preliminary teaching credential, or</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granting of a clear teaching credential, or</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granting of units earned as a requirement for a nurse, speech pathologist, or vocational<br/>1 icense/certification.</p>
<p>Advancement credit will not be allowed for lower division or general education classes unless they are<br/>completed after the awarding of a degree or credential and are &quot;directly related to&quot; the employee’s<br/>program/curriculum and have the approval of the employee’s immediate supervisor and the<br/>Superintendent’s designee in Human Resources.</p>
<p>The procedures for course approval are as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees planning to receive credit for courses should submit a Course Approval Form to the<br/>Superintendent’s designee prior to enrollment to insure that the course meets the criteria of this policy.</p>
<p>a. The Course Approval Form must be signed by the employee’s program administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to receive Salary Schedule credit, employees must present transcripts or grade cards for<br/>completed courses.</p>
<p>Upon recommendation of the program administrator or supervisor, the Superintendent’s designee will<br/>consider such requests for application to the Salary Schedule. It shall be the responsibility of the<br/>Superintendent’s designee to consider each request, individually, without precedent to any other like<br/>request.</p>
<p>One of the following standards shall be used to determine course approval for Salary Schedule<br/>advancement:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper Division or Graduate Courses.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A course in an employee's major or minor.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A course required for an advanced degree in education or in the employee's major or minor or a<br/>course required for a credential for the employee's assignment or licensure/certification. To receive credit</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>under this section, an employee must be actually enrolled in an advanced degree program or have submitted<br/>written intent to enroll to the Superintendent’s designee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A course directly related to a subject presently taught in the school or county program or a course<br/>directly related to a subject tentatively planned for implementation within the County Office. &quot;Directly<br/>related to&quot; is to be interpreted to mean that the course content has a direct immediate benefit to the<br/>classroom instruction as contrasted to an indirect benefit which would accrue from the pursuit of courses of<br/>general interest or generalized knowledge concerning education matters.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;County Office approved in-service Credit</p>
<p>A lower division, upper division, or graduate course, which does not meet one of the requirements of the<br/>above, mentioned criteria may be approved by the Superintendent’s designee on an individual basis. In the<br/>event the Superintendent's designee does not approve such course, the individual may appeal that decision<br/>to the Superintendent, whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p>For salary advancement, credit will be granted for only courses in which a grade of C or better is earned.<br/>For courses that are designated as “pass/fail” or “credit/no credit”, a grade of “pass” or “credit” is required<br/>for salary advancement credit.</p>
<p>Nursing, Speech Pathologist, or Specific Vocational/R.O.P. License or Certification Continuing Education<br/>Requirements: All employees who are required to take various hours of Continuing Education Units<br/>(CEUs), and other course work periodically to maintain their licenses and certifications will be permitted to<br/>advance on the salary schedule. Approved Continuing Units (CEUs) and other courses are equivalent to<br/>academic units under the following formula:</p>
<p>I academic semester unit equals 15 CEUs or hours of instruction in any course required to maintain a license or<br/>certification.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXII - CLASS SIZE/CASELOAD</p>
<p>22.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County Office recognizes that in order to provide a valuable education and a safe environment for<br/>students and staff, class size should be maintained at levels that are conducive to the most effective use of<br/>teaching personnel and the practice of valuable teaching methods for the benefit of students.</p>
<p>22.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the diverse nature of the programs and locations of the programs, the County Office desires<br/>flexibility in determining class sizes and caseloads which are consistent with state law and which<br/>recognize the interests of bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>22.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional Occupational Program</p>
<p>22.3.1 Consistent with state law, the guidelines for every course or program offered by the R.O.P. is<br/>reviewed by the R.O.P. Administration every two years to assure the following:</p>
<p>• The course or program meets a labor market demand</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course or program does not represent unnecessary duplication of other training programs in the<br/>area</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course or program is of demonstrated effectiveness as measured by the employment and<br/>completion success of its students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course or program has a subject matter advisory committee established and operational</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students completing an R.O.P. course or program will be issued a Certificate of Completion by<br/>the instructor</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course or program has sufficient enrollment in each individual approved course</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course has sufficient income to cover all instructional costs.</p>
<p>22.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses that fail to meet Biennial Review requirements and standards may be terminated within<br/>one year of the biennial review.</p>
<p>22.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R.O.P. classes must maintain sufficient enrollment, to be determined by the administrator in<br/>charge, for continuation. A class that falls below minimum enrollment may be terminated.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher shall be notified that his/her enrollment is below the expected minimum.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and his/her supervisors shall discuss methods for increasing enrollment.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXIII - DURATION AND REOPENERS</p>
<p>23.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall become effective July 1, 2013 and shall remain in effect through June 30,</p>
<p>2016.</p>
<p>23.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following school years:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-2015;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-2016, the parties may reopen</p>
