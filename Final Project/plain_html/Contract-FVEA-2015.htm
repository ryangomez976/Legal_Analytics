<p>1</p>
<p>ARTICLE II:</p>
<p>DISTRICT RIGHTS</p>
<p>A POWERS</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed that the District retains all of its powers and authority to<br/>direct, manage, and control to the full extent of the law. Included in, but not limited to,<br/>those duties and powers are the exclusive right to: determine its organization; direct the<br/>work of its Bargaining Unit Members; determine the times and hours of operation;<br/>determine the kinds and levels of services to be provided, and the methods and means of<br/>providing them; establish its educational policies, goals, and objectives; insure the rights<br/>and educational opportunities of students; determine staffing patterns; determine the<br/>number and kinds of personnel required; maintain the efficiency of District operations;<br/>determine the curriculum, build, move, or modify facilities; establish budget procedures<br/>and determine budgetary allocation; determine class size; determine the methods of<br/>raising revenue; contract out work; and take action on any matter in the event of an<br/>emergency. In addition, the Board retains the right to hire, classify, assign, transfer,<br/>evaluate, promote, terminate, and discipline Bargaining Unit Members; however, any<br/>suspension of a Bargaining Unit Member shall be in accordance with the provisions of<br/>Education Code Section 44934.</p>
<p>B EXERCISE OF POWERS</p>
<p>The exercise of the foregoing powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities by the<br/>District, the adoption of policies, rules, regulations, and practices in furtherance thereof,<br/>and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith shall be limited only by<br/>the specific and express terms of this agreement, and then only to the extent such specific<br/>and express terms are in conformance with law.</p>
<p>C DISTRICT RIGHTS TO AMEND, MODIFY, OR RESCIND</p>
<p>The District retains its right to amend, modify or rescind policies and practices referred to<br/>in this Agreement as they are necessary to meet the needs of an emergency.

During emergency situations (exclusive of concerted<br/>activities) the Bargaining Unit Member shall not be required to perform services that will<br/>directly cause serious bodily injury. The determination of whether or not an emergency<br/>exists is solely within the good faith discretion of the Superintendent or designee, and is<br/>expressly excluded from the provisions of Article m. In the event of an emergency, the<br/>Superintendent or designee will inform the Board of Trustees, Management Team<br/>members, the Association, and the newspapers. (Emergency herein shall be defined<br/>according to Black's Law Dictionary revised 4th Edition, page 615.)</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>ARTICLE TTT:</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE</p>
<p>A DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a formal written allegation that the grievant has been adversely<br/>affected by a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the provisions of<br/>this Agreement. (If the allegation is that a District Policy, a District<br/>Administrative Procedure, or a section of the Education Code have been violated,<br/>misinterpreted, or misapplied, see Problem Solving Procedure.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; may be any member of the bargaining unit represented by the<br/>Association or the Association itself under the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One conferee may be selected by the Association to assist in presenting<br/>and processing the grievance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall observe the time limits as if it were the original</p>
<p>grievant.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Conferee&quot; is the individual selected by the grievant to assist him/her in<br/>presenting and processing the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day on which the central administrative office of the Fountain<br/>Valley School District is open for business except winter, spring, and summer<br/>recesses.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having jurisdiction<br/>over the grievant and who has the authority to resolve the particular grievance. If<br/>a Bargaining Unit Member initiates the grievance with an individual other than<br/>the site administrator, when in fact the site administrator/supervisor has the<br/>authority to resolve the grievance, then that individual shall advise the grievant to<br/>re file the grievance with the site administrator/supervisor.</p>
<p>B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TIME LIMITS</p>
<p>Within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the act of omission or when discovery of<br/>said act or omission giving rise to the grievance could have occurred the grievant shall<br/>present the grievance in writing on the appropriate form to the lowest level supervisor<br/>who can resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INFORMAL CONFERENCE</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant should attempt to resolve it by an<br/>informal conference with the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>D FORMAL</p>
<p>1. Level I</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the time specification under Section B of this Article, the<br/>grievant shall present the grievance in writing on the appropriate form to<br/>the immediate supervisor. This statement shall be a clear, concise<br/>'statement of the grievance, citing the specific section of this Agreement<br/>allegedly to have been violated and/or misinterpreted and/or misapplied,<br/>the circumstances involved, the decision, if any, rendered at the informal<br/>conference, the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor shall communicate the decision to the Bargaining Unit<br/>Member in writing within ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. If<br/>the supervisor does not respond within the time limits, all fees and<br/>expenses of the arbitrator and hearing shall be borne by the District. If the<br/>grievant or Association does not respond within the time limits, the<br/>grievance will be dropped.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limits either the grievant or the supervisor may<br/>request, and shall be granted a personal conference with the other party.</p>
<p>2. Level II</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the grievant<br/>may, within ten (10) days, appeal the decision on the appropriate form to<br/>the Superintendent or designee. If the grievance was filed with the<br/>Superintendent or designee at Level I, then it is understood that Level II<br/>can be waived. The grievant may proceed to Level in.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall include a copy of the original grievance, the decision<br/>rendered, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the appeal.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall communicate the decision to the<br/>grievant on the appropriate form within fifteen (15) days. If the Superin¬<br/>tendent or designee does not respond within the time limits all fees and<br/>expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne by the District.</p>
<p>3. Level HI</p>

<p>ARTICLE XTTT: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRANSFER AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>A DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer refers to any District action which results in the movement of a<br/>probationary or tenured Bargaining Unit Member from the position he/she holds<br/>immediately preceding such action to another position within the same job<br/>classification but at a different school.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All personnel are employees of the District and not of a particular school. The<br/>District shall have the final prerogative in determining the assignment of<br/>certificated personnel according to the needs of the District, interests of the<br/>children and the individual teacher, subject to the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer may be Bargaining Unit Member initiated (voluntary) or District<br/>initiated (involuntary).</p>
<p>B VOLUNTARY TRANSFER</p>
<p>A Bargaining Unit Member desiring a voluntary transfer shall submit the request<br/>according to the following procedures:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Bargaining Unit Member may apply for a voluntary transfer by submitting a<br/>transfer request form to the Personnel Division either when a vacancy is posted or<br/>in advance of the posting of a vacancy.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of those individuals requesting a transfer shall be prepared and sent to<br/>the school of their request. When a vacancy becomes available, the hiring<br/>supervisor shall establish an interview time with the individual(s) requesting a<br/>transfer to that location before the position has been filled.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision to apply for or not to apply for a voluntary transfer shall be the<br/>Bargaining Unit Member's independent decision.</p>
<p>C INVOLUNTARY TRANSFER</p>
<p>1. Bargaining Unit Members may be involuntarily transferred when any one of the<br/>following conditions exist:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credential Authorization</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening and closing of schools</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declining and increasing enrollment</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School or staff needs</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal and Bargaining Unit Member agreement based on Bargaining<br/>Unit Member request.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making transfer decisions pursuant to paragraphs l.c and l.d of this section the<br/>immediate supervisor shall utilize the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Needs: The Bargaining Unit Member either (1) has skills, training,<br/>education and/or experience which are uniquely suited to meeting the needs of<br/>students at a different school, or (2) cannot meet the needs of the students (e g.,<br/>grade level, special education, bilingual, bicultural, gifted) at the Bargaining<br/>Unit Member's present school.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational Program Needs: The Bargaining Unit Member either (1) has<br/>strengths, abilities, experience in programs, use of materials and/or<br/>teaching levels that uniquely qualify the unit member to meet the needs of<br/>the educational program at a different school, or (2) lacks the strengths,<br/>abilities, or experience in programs, use of materials and/or teaching levels<br/>that exist and/or are operational or will be operational in the Bargaining<br/>Unit Member's school.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority: Except as otherwise provided in paragraph C.9, when none of<br/>the above applies or when the above criteria equally apply to more than<br/>one unit member, the Bargaining Unit Member involuntarily transferred<br/>shall be the Bargaining Unit Member with the least District seniority.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance Related Transfers: The immediate supervisor may transfer a<br/>Bargaining Unit Member if the Bargaining Unit Member's performance impedes<br/>the instructional program by reason of the Bargaining Unit Member's inability or<br/>unwillingness to work cooperatively toward the common goals of the school.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time they receive notice of intent to involuntary transfer, the Bargaining<br/>Unit Member may request written reasons for the involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before any involuntary transfer is effected, the Bargaining Unit Member must be<br/>advised, through personal notice by the principal or supervisor initiating the<br/>request for transfer, that an involuntary transfer is being recommended.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, an opportunity shall be provided for the Bargaining Unit Member<br/>to meet with the recommending supervisor to discuss the proposed transfer.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor shall consider alternative solutions that the Bargaining Unit<br/>Member may propose.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A current list of the District's vacant positions shall be made available for each<br/>Bargaining Unit Member being considered for an involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining Unit Members who have been involuntarily transferred shall not be<br/>subject to another involuntary transfer until they have completed two (2) school<br/>years at the site to which they were transferred. If the Bargaining Unit Member is<br/>transferred to a school which closes, this does not apply.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the condition which necessitated an involuntary transfer changes and that position<br/>becomes available again, the Bargaining Unit Member who was involuntarily<br/>transferred from that position shall have the option of returning to his/her original<br/>position. This is intended to cover situations where student enrollment conditions<br/>change over the summer months, which would cause the position to be reinstated.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining Unit Members who are being involuntarily transferred for the ensuing<br/>school year shall be notified by June 1, whenever possible.</p>
<p>D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPECIAL EDUCATION INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a resource specialist, special day class teacher, a speech and language<br/>teacher, or adapted physical education teacher is transferred from his/her major<br/>assignment, the Bargaining Unit Member is subject to all regular transfer<br/>procedures.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Bargaining Unit Member is transferred from a minor assignment, Article XIII,<br/>Transfer and Assignment, Section C., Involuntary Transfer, Numbers 9 and 10, do not<br/>apply. Such transfers are dictated by shifts in case population. Every attempt will be<br/>made to maintain continuity in special education assignments.</p>
<p>E &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COUNSELOR AND NURSE ASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, individual schedules shall be cooperatively developed<br/>between the Unit Member and the appropriate District Administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When assigning counselors and nurses, all transfer procedures shall apply.</p>
<p>However, the supervisor in charge may waive Sections 9 or 10 if it is in the best<br/>interest of the program.</p>

Temporary and probationary teachers will be provided support and<br/>assistance by means outside of this Article.
