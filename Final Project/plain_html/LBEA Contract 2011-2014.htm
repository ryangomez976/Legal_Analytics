<p>4.3 Incentive Increment Retirement</p>
<p>4.3.1 The District Board of Trustees may, by formal action, determine that<br/>because of impending curtailment of or changes in the manner of<br/>performing services the best interests of the District would be served by<br/>encouraging retirement of certificated employees and that such retirement<br/>will (1) result in a net savings to the District, or (2) result in a reduction in<br/>the number of certificated employees as a result of declining enrollment,<br/>or (3) result in the retention of certificated employees who are credentialed<br/>to teach in teacher shortage disciplines. When this occurs, an additional<br/>two (2) years of service shall be credited to a retiring unit member under<br/>STRS, provided:</p>
<p>a. The teacher is credited with five (5) or more years of service credit<br/>under STRS and retires during a window period of not more than</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County Superintendent of Schools has certified that the effect<br/>of the District’s formal action will result in a net savings for the<br/>District.</p>
<p>4.3.2 If the District acts to implement the previous article, it shall apply only to</p>
<p>unit members who:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are at least fifty five (55) years of age;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are eligible to retire under STRS rules; and</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit a letter of retirement within the window specified in 4.3.1.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are required by the District to use their personal automobile in<br/>the performance of regular duties and who have received written authorization<br/>from the Superintendent or his designee, shall be reimbursed at a rate<br/>established by the federal government so as not to be accounted to the<br/>employee as income. The provision will be regularly reviewed and subject to<br/>change as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have been granted unpaid leave may, by paying the<br/>appropriate premium, continue existing fringe benefits available under Section</p>
<p>4.1.</p>
<p>Unit members choosing to exercise this right must submit to the District, no later<br/>than the fifteenth (15th) of the month preceding the month in which the District<br/>payment is due, the proper premium amount. If such premium amount is not so<br/>received, fringe benefits will be terminated for the balance of the leave.</p>

<p>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request by District Management, a unit member shall be required to<br/>present a medical doctor’s certificate verifying that the absence was due<br/>to personal injury or illness. When such a verification is required by the<br/>District, the doctor will be selected by the District and the fee for such an<br/>examination will be paid for by the District unless the doctor concludes<br/>that the absence was not due to personal illness or injury. Further, if the<br/>doctor concludes that the absence was not due to personal illness or<br/>injury, or that the illness was not sufficiently severe to warrant absence<br/>from work, then the Superintendent, after notice to the unit member, may<br/>refuse to grant such leave. The doctor will make all necessary inquiries in<br/>order to be fully informed as to the nature and severity of the illness or<br/>injury and report such finding to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is absent for illness or injury for a period of time in excess<br/>of ten (10) consecutive days, the unit member shall remain on sick leave<br/>and shall not return to work until he/she submits his/her medical doctor’s<br/>authorization to return to work.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious holidays (provided written notice is given one (1) week in<br/>advance of the day to be taken);</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) days for unspecified personal use provided written notice<br/>is given (which may not be used the day before or the day after a<br/>holiday or a weekend).</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other personal necessities which are allowed at the discretion of<br/>the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the utilization of personal necessity leave, a unit member must<br/>obtain prior written approval from the Superintendent or designee except<br/>for cases a. and b. in Section 5.2.2. Should the circumstances outlined in</p>
<p>a. and b. arise, the employee shall make every effort to comply with<br/>District procedures to enable the District to secure a substitute.</p>
