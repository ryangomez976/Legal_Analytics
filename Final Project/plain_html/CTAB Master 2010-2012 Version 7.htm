This<br/>agreement will be format “Al” or “A2” (if the employee is solicited to<br/>do a specific project) or “B” (if the employee presents an independent<br/>product or concept not based on District curriculum). The formats for<br/>these contracts are attached and incorporated into this Agreement as<br/>Appendix H.</p>
<p>4.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association will be provided a copy of each proposed contract<br/>before the unit member executes the contract.

<p>ARTICLE 7; GRIEVANCE</p>
<p>7.1 Problem Solving Procedures</p>
<p>Prior to implementation of the Procedures for Grievance, unit members are<br/>encouraged to attempt to identify and resolve a problem informally. Both the unit<br/>member and the District have the right to a conferee at the problem solving<br/>conferences. No reprisals shall be invoked against any unit member for<br/>processing a grievance. The parties are encouraged to work together at all stages<br/>of the grievance procedure to resolve grievances.</p>
<p>7.2 Grievance Alternative</p>
<p>Unit members with concerns, that do not meet the grievance definition, have the<br/>opportunity to bring their concerns to the appropriate District Office administrator<br/>and/or the Superintendent after consultation with the site administrator or<br/>department supervisor.</p>
<p>7.3 Definitions</p>
<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance</p>
<p>A grievance is an allegation by a grievant that he/she has been<br/>adversely affected by a violation of the specific provision of the<br/>contract. Actions to challenge or change the policies of the District as<br/>set forth in the rules and regulations, or administrative procedures,<br/>must be undertaken through separate processes.</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferee</p>
<p>A conferee is a fellow faculty member, department head, supervisor,<br/>administrator, organization representative, or other District employee,<br/>chosen by the unit member, who can assist the unit member and<br/>District in resolving the dispute prior to Level 4 (Arbitration).</p>
<p>7.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working Day</p>
<p>During the school year, a working day is any calendar workday in the<br/>basic work year for unit members as defined and determined in<br/>Sections 14.8.1 and 14.8.2. During the summer recess, a “working<br/>day” is any day on which the administrative office of the District is<br/>open for business. These definitions of “working day” apply only to<br/>Article 7.</p>
<p>73.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant</p>
<p>A grievant is a unit member, a group of unit members having the same<br/>grievance or the Association when filed by the Association President<br/>or designee.</p>

<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>reassignment to open positions in their own school site; and<br/>individuals who seek voluntary transfers.</p>
<p>12.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for transfer between schools shall be in writing on forms<br/>obtained from the Personnel Office. Such requests must be submitted<br/>to the Personnel Office by April 1.

<p>12.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all instances, for the purposes of selection between two or more unit<br/>members, with the required credential for a vacant position, all factors<br/>being equal, the District shall select the more senior member if the<br/>selection decision is made on or before April 15 for the following<br/>school year. As required by Education Code Section 35036, after<br/>April 15, the seniority priority described in this subsection shall not<br/>apply. In the determination of equality between two or more unit<br/>members who have applied for an open position, the District shall<br/>consider: special program needs, the applicant’s special training,<br/>professional skills, academic preparation, experience, and major/minor<br/>fields of study, competencies, past evaluations, and advanced degrees<br/>of each unit member.</p>
<p>12.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Officer shall provide unit members requesting a transfer<br/>from one school to another with a written statement regarding the<br/>status of their request within ten (10) working days after receipt of the<br/>transfer request.

<p>12.4.7 A permanent unit member’s request for transfer to another school shall<br/>have first consideration over newly employed certificated personnel,<br/>unless the selection decision is made after April 15 for the following<br/>school year, in which case this consideration priority shall not apply.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer due to Reduced Enrollment</p>
<p>12.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those cases where transfer or reassignment is necessary, during the<br/>school year, it shall be the District’s policy to: (1) give first<br/>consideration to voluntary transfers or reassignment, (2) seek such<br/>changes through consultation with individuals requested to transfer or<br/>be reassigned, (3) provide ample time to make necessary arrangements<br/>for such transfer or reassignment, and (4) in the case of involuntary<br/>transfer, the site administrator shall first seek volunteers. If no<br/>volunteers are found, the site administrator must select the least senior<br/>unit member (based on the District’s Certificated Seniority List).</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Officer shall provide a unit member transferred under<br/>this policy with a listing of current openings in the District and make<br/>reasonable effort to find a satisfactory reassignment similar to the one<br/>vacated.</p>

<p>29</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>12.6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference shall be summarized in writing by the site<br/>administrator with copies sent to the unit member, the<br/>representative, and the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>12.6.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member being considered for an administrative<br/>transfer may request a conference with the Superintendent<br/>or designee within five (5) working days following the site<br/>administrator/unit member conference.</p>
<p>12.6.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an egregious act(s) by a unit member, a site<br/>administrator may recommend an immediate involuntary<br/>transfer.

<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>ARTICLE 13: CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>For the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years only. Sections 13.1-13.4 shall be revised<br/>as indicated below. With the exception of Subsections 13.4.1-13.4.3, the changes to<br/>these sections shall cease to be operative on June 30, 2014. Unless otherwise changed in<br/>re-opener negotiations pursuant to Article 26, Section 26.2.2, the status quo ante for<br/>negotiations regarding Article 13, Sections 13.1-13.2 for 2014-2015 shall be the language<br/>of those sections in effect in the Negotiated Agreement that expired on June 30, 2010.</p>
<p>13.1 Staffing</p>
<p>13.1.1 For the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years only, staff will be<br/>assigned according to the following ratio:</p>
<p>13.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atK-3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level, as long as the District participates in the</p>
<p>State Program for class size reduction;</p>
<p>13.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grades&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4-5 level; and</p>
<p>13.1.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;middle school.</p>
<p>13 1 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-2014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staffing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio Calculation</p>
<p>13 121 Grade K-3</p>
<p>For purposes of determining the grade K-3 staffing ratio,<br/>divide the total enrollment at the school in grades K-3 by<br/>24. The resulting quotient represents the number of<br/>teachers necessary to maintain the 24:1 staffing ratio. If the<br/>quotient is not a whole number, it will be rounded up if any<br/>fractional amount is equal to or greater than 0.5, and<br/>rounded down if any fractional amount is less than 0.5.</p>
<p>The 24:1 staffing ratio will be deemed met if the school’s<br/>total K-3 enrollment at the school divided by the number of<br/>teachers assigned to teach grades K-3 is 24.49 or less.</p>
<p>13 1.2.2 Grade 4-5 and Grade 6-8</p>
<p>For purposes of determining the grade 4-5 and grade 6-8<br/>staffing ratios, divide the total enrollment at the school in<br/>grades 4-5 or grades 6-8 (as applicable) by 32. The<br/>resulting quotient represents the number of teachers<br/>necessary to maintain the 32:1 staffing ratio at the school.<br/>If the quotient is not a whole number, it will be rounded up<br/>if any fractional amount is equal to or greater than 0.5, and<br/>rounded down if any fractional amount is less than 0.5.</p>
<p>The 32:1 staffing ratio will be deemed met if the school’s<br/>total grade level enrollment in grades 4-5 or grades 6-8 (as</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>applicable) divided by the number of teachers assigned to<br/>teach those grades is 32.49 or less.</p>
<p>13.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of staffing at the beginning of the school year, as soon<br/>as the average regular class size in a school exceeds the staffing ratio<br/>per school, the principal shall contact the District Office and determine<br/>what action can be taken to accommodate the excess of students in the<br/>school. The District will take action as soon as practicable, and in no<br/>instance later than 20 school days from the beginning of the school<br/>year. For the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years, the required<br/>action shall include, but need not be limited to the overload provisions<br/>of section 13.2 below.</p>
<p>13.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the middle school, different strategies may be employed to maintain<br/>the 32:1 ratio, including allowing existing staff to teach extra sections,<br/>up to a maximum of ten (10) sections at each middle school.</p>
<p>13.1.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who agree to teach an extra period shall receive<br/>compensation based on the following formula: base salary<br/>x .167/180 = rate per section per day which will not be<br/>creditable to the STRS Defined Benefits Plan, but may be<br/>credited to the STRS Supplemental Plan. If the period<br/>occurs during the periods 1-6, teachers shall be required to<br/>extend their school day by one period. Teachers electing<br/>this option shall conform to Article 14.3.</p>
<p>13.1.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrator and school staff will determine<br/>variations in class size according to program needs.</p>
<p>13.1.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education staff shall not be included in determining<br/>student ratio.</p>
<p>13.2 Overload Procedures</p>
<p>13.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the individual classroom enrollment in grades K-5 exceed 33<br/>students (34 students when the school has created a resource teacher<br/>position out of the teacher/student ratio), the site administrator shall:</p>
<p>(1) reorganize classes in a manner so as to reasonably balance class<br/>size, or (2) if reorganization is impractical, contact the District office<br/>to determine what action can be taken to accommodate the excess<br/>number of students in the class(es).</p>
<p>13.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 school years only (subject to<br/>reopening for 2011-2012 pursuant to Article 26), the following staffing<br/>and class size payments shall apply:</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>13.2.2.1 Grade K-3 School-wide Staffing Payment</p>
<p>13.2.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the K-3 school-wide staffing ratios set<br/>forth in Section 13.1.1 above are met, there<br/>shall be no Grade K-3 school-wide staffing<br/>payment.</p>
<p>13.2.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the school-wide staffing ratio set forth<br/>above in grades K-3 at a school is exceeded,<br/>each teacher assigned to teach at grades K-3<br/>at the school shall receive $150 per<br/>attendance period in which the school-wide<br/>staffing ratio in grades K-3 is exceeded.</p>
<p>13 .2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary School Grade-Level Staffing/Class Size</p>
<p>Payment</p>
<p>Regardless of whether any Grade K-3 school-wide staffing<br/>payment applies, the District will provide class size<br/>payments in elementary schools under the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>13.2.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size Payments:</p>
<p>13.2.2.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the average number of<br/>students enrolled per teacher<br/>at a single grade level in<br/>grades K-3 is 24 students or<br/>fewer, no grade-level<br/>staffing/class size payment<br/>shall apply. For purposes of<br/>this calculation, the grade-<br/>level averages for<br/>kindergarten, first grade,<br/>second grade, and third grade<br/>shall be calculated separately.</p>
<p>13.2.2.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the average number of<br/>students enrolled per teacher<br/>at a single grade level in<br/>grades K-3 is more than 24<br/>students, all teachers in the<br/>K-3 grade level who have<br/>more than 24 students<br/>enrolled in their classes shall<br/>receive a class size payment<br/>of $5/student/day for each<br/>student over 24. Teachers at</p>

<p>13.2.2.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the average number of<br/>students enrolled per teacher<br/>at a single grade level in<br/>grades 4-5 is 32 students or<br/>fewer, no grade-level<br/>staffing/class size payment<br/>shall apply. For purposes of<br/>this calculation, the grade-<br/>level averages for grades 4<br/>and 5 shall be calculated<br/>separately.</p>
<p>13.2.2.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the average number of<br/>students enrolled per teacher<br/>at a single grade level in<br/>grades 4-5 is more than 32<br/>students, all teachers in the<br/>grades 4-5 grade level who<br/>have more than 32 students<br/>enrolled in their classes shall<br/>receive a class size payment<br/>of $5/student/day for each<br/>student over 32. Teachers at<br/>a grade level with 32 or fewer<br/>students enrolled in the class<br/>shall receive no class size<br/>payment.</p>
<p>13.2.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination Class Calculation:</p>
<p>For purposes of calculating staffing ratios<br/>and class size payments at elementary<br/>schools, a combination class shall be<br/>counted as part of the lowest grade level in<br/>the combination (e.g., a grade 3/4<br/>combination will be covered as a grade 3<br/>class).</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>13 .2.2.3 Middle School Grade-Level Staffing/Class Size Penalty</p>
<p>13.2.2.3.1 The District will provide class size payments<br/>in middle schools to any teacher when the<br/>total number of students enrolled in the<br/>teacher’s classes exceeds the following<br/>numbers:</p>

<p>classes in math, science,<br/>English language arts, social<br/>sciences, and any English<br/>Language Development<br/>classes in these required core<br/>subjects;</p>
<p>13.2.2.3.1.2</p>
<p>180 students in physical<br/>education classes;</p>
<p>13.2.2.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elective</p>
<p>classes other than music;</p>

<p>13.2.2.3.2 The middle school class size payment shall<br/>be $1 per day per student in excess of the<br/>number of students listed above. The<br/>student thresholds listed above shall be<br/>prorated if the teacher is assigned to teach<br/>classes in more than one of the subject areas<br/>listed above.</p>
<p>13 .2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Class Size Payment</p>
<p>13.2.2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will endeavor to balance class<br/>enrollments at grade levels at each school to<br/>the extent such balancing is reasonably<br/>practicable and meets the needs of the<br/>District and students’ instructional needs.</p>
<p>13.2.2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No class size payments shall be assessed<br/>during the first attendance accounting period<br/>of each school year. (This does not apply to<br/>SDC class size payments required under<br/>Section 13.4.4 which begins on the first day<br/>of school.) Attendance accounting periods<br/>are approximately 20 student instructional<br/>days. In order to avoid the need to calculate<br/>actual enrollment and staffing on a daily</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>basis, all class size payments shall be<br/>determined based on the enrollments,<br/>staffing ratios, and/or class sizes calculated<br/>on the last day of each attendance<br/>accounting period. The enrollments,<br/>staffing ratios, and/or class sizes calculated<br/>on this date shall be deemed to have been in<br/>place for the entire attendance accounting<br/>period, and any class size calculated on the<br/>date shall be deemed to have been in place<br/>for the entire attendance accounting period,<br/>and any class size payments shall be based<br/>on the data derived from the last day of the<br/>applicable attendance accounting period.</p>
<p>13.2.2.4.3 All class size payments shall be prorated for<br/>part-time teachers.</p>
<p>13.3 Overload Plan</p>
<p>The plan, according to 13.2 above, shall be communicated to involved staff by the<br/>site administrator within five (5) working days of the assignment of a student who<br/>creates the overload. The implementation of the plan shall be completed within<br/>twenty (20) working days. When resource specialist case loads exceed twenty-<br/>eight (28) students, the District shall: (1) reorganize in a manner so as to<br/>reasonably balance case loads; or (2) if reorganization is impractical, the<br/>Association and the District will meet to determine what action can be taken to<br/>accommodate the excess case load.</p>
<p>13.4 Provisions for Special Education Teachers</p>
<p>13.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will follow the caseload limits for Resource Specialist as<br/>set forth in Education Code 56362 (28); and for 3-5 year-olds in<br/>Education Code 56441.5 adult to child ratio (5 to 1).</p>
<p>13.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(LSH)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therapists&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caseload</p>
<p>not to exceed 55 unless Education Code 56363.3 is revised. The<br/>caseload shall not exceed the number specified in the Education Code.</p>
<p>13 .4.3 LSH therapists who serve 3-5 year olds shall have a caseload not to<br/>exceed 40 unless Education Code 56441.7 is revised. The caseload<br/>shall not exceed the number specified in the Education Code.</p>
<p>13.4.4 For the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 years only, if Special Day Classes<br/>exceed the following maximums, the District shall pay the teachers in<br/>those classes the amounts specified in Section 13.4.4.3:</p>
<p>13.4.4.1 Moderate to Severe (in all schools): 10 students per<br/>teacher.</p>

<p>13.4.4.3</p>
<p>13.4.4.4</p>
<p>Mild to Moderate (in elementary schools only): 14<br/>students per teacher.</p>
<p>If the number of students assigned to Special Day Classes<br/>exceeds the amounts specified in Sections 13.4.4.1 and</p>
<p>13.4.4.2, the teachers assigned to those classes shall receive<br/>a payment of $5/student/day for each student in the Special<br/>Day Class over the specified amounts.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the need to calculate actual enrollment<br/>and staffing on a daily basis, all class size payments shall<br/>be determined based on the enrollments, staffing ratios,<br/>and/or class sizes calculated on the last day of each<br/>attendance accounting period. The enrollments, staffing<br/>ratios, and/or class sizes calculated on this date shall be<br/>deemed to have been in place for the entire attendance<br/>accounting period, and any class size calculated on the date<br/>shall be deemed to have been in place for the entire<br/>attendance accounting period, and any class size payments<br/>shall be based on the data derived from the last day of the<br/>applicable attendance accounting period.</p>

<p>evaluation must be given to unit members being evaluated.</p>
<p>15.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>15.1.2.1 The District shall evaluate and assess certificated unit<br/>members’ performance as it reasonably relates to:</p>
<p>15.1.2.1.1 The progress of students toward the<br/>District’s content standards, and if<br/>applicable, the state adopted academic<br/>content standards as measured by state<br/>adopted criterion referenced assessments;</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>15.1.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies<br/>used by the unit member;</p>
<p>15.1.2.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit members’ adherence to the<br/>District’s curriculum;</p>
<p>15.1.2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of the<br/>learning environment;</p>
<p>15.1.2.1.5 The unit member’s ability to communicate<br/>effectively;</p>
<p>15.1.2.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fulfillment of professional</p>
<p>responsibilities.</p>
<p>15.1.2.2 For non-instructional unit members, or for unit members<br/>without a case load, the District shall evaluate and assess<br/>their performance as it reasonably relates to the fulfillment<br/>of the job responsibilities as set forth in the appropriate job<br/>descriptions.</p>
<p>15.1.2.3 The California Standards for the Teaching Profession shall<br/>be utilized to evaluate teachers on criteria 15.1.2.1.2<br/>through 15.1.2.1.5 listed above.</p>
<p>15.1.3 Formal Observation Procedures for Unit Members</p>
<p>15.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal classroom observation must be completed with<br/>the accompanying observation form to follow within five<br/>working days. This observation must be a minimum of<br/>twenty (20) minutes in length and a maximum of forty-five<br/>(45) minutes. Observations of middle school unit members<br/>may last the length of a standard instructional period. The<br/>observation may be for a longer period of time if mutually<br/>agreed to by the evaluatee and the evaluator.</p>
<p>15.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each evaluator must conduct at least two formal<br/>observations for non-permanent unit members. The first<br/>formal observation shall be completed by January 31, and<br/>the second formal observation shall be completed by April</p>
<p>15.</p>
<p>15.1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observations will be reduced to writing and made<br/>available to the evaluatee within five (5) working days of<br/>their occurrence. The evaluator and the evaluatee shall<br/>hold a post-observation conference within ten (10) working<br/>days after the formal observation.</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>15.1.3.4 If the evaluator elects to conduct formal observations of a<br/>permanent unit member, the procedures and timelines for<br/>formal evaluations in Section 15.1.1 shall be followed, and<br/>any such formal observation(s) shall be completed no later<br/>than April 15.</p>
<p>15.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation as a Continuous Process</p>
<p>Data will be collected and shared regarding performance on a<br/>continuous basis. The evaluator is expected to address significant<br/>concerns and deficiencies with the unit member throughout the year,<br/>and shall not unreasonably “hold” such concerns for the evaluation. If<br/>a deficiency is noted in an evaluation, a conference must be held with<br/>the evaluatee to review the matter and possible recommendations for<br/>improvement. The evaluator’s role to assist the unit member shall<br/>include, but need not be limited to Article 15.5.1.1 to 15.5.1.4.</p>
<p>15.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluators for Itinerant and Non-Classroom Unit Members</p>
<p>15.1.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For itinerant unit members with a caseload who are<br/>assigned to more than one site, the Superintendent or<br/>designee shall assign the evaluator. In most instances the<br/>evaluator shall be one of the itinerant unit member’s site<br/>administrators. The evaluator shall coordinate the input<br/>from the other site administrators to whom the unit member<br/>is assigned. The evaluator is responsible for meeting with<br/>the evaluatee for planning purposes, for convening all<br/>evaluation conferences, and for completing and signing the<br/>evaluation forms.</p>
<p>15.1.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For non-classroom unit members who do not have a regular<br/>caseload (e g., nurses, counselors, psychologists, program<br/>specialists, librarians, and teacher advisors), the<br/>Superintendent or designee shall assign the evaluator who<br/>shall be responsible for the evaluation, including meeting<br/>with the evaluatee for planning purposes, for convening all<br/>evaluation conferences, for completing and signing all<br/>evaluation forms, and for obtaining input from all the<br/>appropriate administrators to whom the employee is<br/>assigned.</p>
<p>15 2 General Evaluation Guidelines</p>
<p>15.2.1 Permanent certificated unit members shall be evaluated at least every<br/>other year. Non-permanent unit members and permanent unit<br/>members who are on an Assistance Plan shall be evaluated every year.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>15.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two styles of evaluation are provided for in the Certificated<br/>Employees Evaluation System. In the third year of permanency a unit<br/>member may choose the Self-Evaluation Option if: (1) mutually<br/>agreed to with the site administrator; (2) the employee received “Meets<br/>or Exceeds Standards” on his/her prior evaluation; and (3) the<br/>employee has been in the District for 5 years.</p>
<p>15.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As allowed by Education Code Section 44664(a)(3), with the mutual<br/>agreement of the evaluator and unit member, a permanent unit member<br/>may be evaluated at least every five (5) years if he/she has been<br/>employed at least ten (10) years with the District, is highly qualified, if<br/>he/she occupies a position that is required to be filled by a highly<br/>qualified professional by the Federal No Child Left Behind Act as<br/>defined in 20 U.S.C.S. 7801, and whose previous evaluation rated the<br/>unit member as meeting or exceeding standards. The evaluator or the<br/>unit member may withdraw consent for this five-year evaluation<br/>option at any time.</p>
<p>15.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator and evaluatee shall sign all forms. Such signature does<br/>not constitute agreement with the judgments of the evaluator, but only<br/>that the evaluatee has read the evaluation document and received a<br/>copy.</p>
<p>15.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms used at all stages of the Evaluation process must be mutually<br/>agreed upon by the District and the Association and are contained in<br/>Appendix F. If there is a conflict between Article 15 and Appendix F,<br/>the provision of Article 15 takes precedence. The evaluation<br/>timelines, the District evaluation goals and indicators, and all the<br/>evaluation forms shall constitute the Certificated Employee Evaluation<br/>System, which is contained in Appendix F and incorporated into this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>15.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluatees shall have the right to attach written comments to any<br/>evaluation documents.</p>
<p>15.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluator shall not base the evaluation of a unit member on<br/>information that the evaluator has not verified, substantiated, or<br/>corroborated.</p>
<p>15.3 Evaluation of Certificated Staff Assigned or Reassigned After the Beginning</p>
<p>of the School Year</p>
<p>Whenever a certificated staff member is assigned to a position after October 15<br/>and before March 1, or is reassigned during that period, it will be the<br/>responsibility of the evaluator and the evaluatee to conduct a Planning Conference<br/>and complete a Planning Conference Report form. It is suggested that the<br/>constraints be noted regarding the remaining portion of the school year, the<br/>unique characteristics of the assignment, and other factors that affect the</p>

<p>15.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s established grievance procedures may be utilized for</p>
<p>processing disputes that may arise over the evaluation procedure, but<br/>shall not be used to challenge the professional judgments of the<br/>evaluator.</p>
<p>15.5 Assistance Plan and Participation in the Peer Assistance Program</p>
<p>15.5.1 An Assistance Plan is required for any employee who receives a “Does<br/>Not Meet Standards” on an evaluation. The evaluator shall confer<br/>with the employee and make specific recommendations as to areas of<br/>improvement in the employee’s performance and endeavor to assist<br/>the employee in such performance. By September 15 of the<br/>contractual year’s beginning, these recommendations must be reduced<br/>to writing, and together with a timeline will constitute the Assistance<br/>Plan. Any unit member on an Assistance Plan must annually<br/>participate in the evaluation process until the unit member receives a<br/>positive evaluation. The Assistance Plan shall include at least the<br/>following:</p>
<p>15.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of the duties performed in an unsatisfactory<br/>manner below District standards;</p>
<p>15.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of measurable improvement required to meet<br/>District standards;</p>
<p>15.5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description of assistance the District will provide to help<br/>the unit member meet the District’s standards; and</p>

<p>15.6 Employee Files</p>
<p>15.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of a unit member’s Summary Certificated Personnel Evaluation<br/>Report shall be filed only in the District Personnel Office and the<br/>evaluator’s office. These files are open for inspection by the unit<br/>member and/or a designated representative having the unit member’s<br/>written authorization.</p>
<p>15.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature shall not be entered or filed unless<br/>or until the unit member is given notice and an opportunity to review,<br/>to comment, and sign an acknowledging receipt.</p>
<p>15.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall have the right to attach written comments to any<br/>derogatory statement. A unit member may review the file during<br/>normal Personnel Office hours.</p>

<p>16.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated unit members who teach a full session of Summer School<br/>shall be granted one (1) additional day of sick leave. (See Section</p>

<p>16.4</p>
<p>16.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a unit member to provide a medical<br/>certification from a physician verifying the illness or disability, which<br/>resulted in the absence. Failure by the unit member to provide such<br/>written medical certification shall result in loss of the 50% per diem<br/>pay. The District shall continue to make all contributions toward the<br/>unit member’s health and welfare program that are required by Article<br/>10 during this period of disability.</p>
<p>16.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month<br/>period shall run consecutively. A unit member shall not be provided<br/>more than one five-month period per illness or accident.

The physician’s statement shall be<br/>specific as to the expected duration of the unit member’s absence due<br/>to the illness/disability. At reasonable intervals thereafter, the District<br/>may require from the unit member additional written statements by a<br/>physician certifying to the continuing disability.</p>
<p>16.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a scheduled disability (surgery, childbirth, etc.), the unit<br/>member shall notify the Personnel Officer in writing of the anticipated<br/>absence. Such notification shall include the anticipated beginning date<br/>of leave, and the anticipated date of return to duty. Whenever<br/>possible, such notification shall be provided at least twenty (20)<br/>working days prior to the scheduled disability.</p>
<p>Leave to Care for a Child, Parent, or Spouse</p>
<p>16.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any school year, unit members may use up to six (6) days of sick<br/>leave to attend to an illness of the unit member’s child, parent, spouse,<br/>or domestic partner. For the purpose of this section, “domestic<br/>partner” shall be defined according to Article 10, Section 10.2.

<p>16.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may also use accrued and available sick leave to care<br/>for family members pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act and<br/>the California Family Rights Act as specified in Appendix G.</p>
<p>16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave for Personal Necessity</p>
<p>16.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated unit members may use up to seven (7) days of sick leave<br/>per year reasons of personal necessity. Personal necessity days may<br/>not be carried over from one year to the next.</p>

<p>16.12.1 Definitions</p>
<p>16.12.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that<br/>is expected to incapacitate a member of the bargaining unit<br/>for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates a unit<br/>member’s family, and that incapacity requires the<br/>bargaining unit member to take time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time to care for that family member, and<br/>taking extended time off from work creates a financial<br/>hardship for the bargaining unit member because all of<br/>his/her sick leave and other paid time off has been<br/>exhausted.</p>
<p>16.12.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible leave credits means sick leave accrued to the<br/>donating bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>16.12.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family members shall be as defined in this Article for<br/>bereavement</p>
<p>16122 Eligibility</p>
<p>16.12.2.1 Eligible leave credits may be donated to a bargaining unit<br/>member for a catastrophic illness or injury if all of the<br/>following requirements are met:</p>
<p>16.12.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member who is, or<br/>whose family member is suffering from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury requires that<br/>eligible leave credits be donated and<br/>provides verification of catastrophic injury<br/>or illness as required by the District.</p>
<p>16.12.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District determines that the bargaining<br/>unit member is unable to work due to the<br/>bargaining unit member’s, or his or her<br/>family member’s, catastrophic illness or<br/>injury.</p>
<p>16.12.2.1.3 The unit member requesting donations of<br/>sick leave has exhausted all accrued paid<br/>leave credits, including differential leave.</p>
<p>16.12.3 Procedure</p>
<p>16.12.3.1 A unit member who wishes to receive the catastrophic<br/>illness benefit must request in writing to the Association<br/>and District that sick leave donations be solicited on his or<br/>her behalf. The request must be accompanied by a<br/>verification of the catastrophic injury or illness.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>16.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.2 Donations will be solicited by a joint announcement of the</p>
<p>Association and District on behalf of a specifically named<br/>individual who meets the requirements for this benefit.</p>
<p>16.12.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave may be donated in one hour increments.</p>
<p>16.12.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of time that donated leave credits<br/>may be used by the recipient bargaining unit member shall<br/>not exceed twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>16.12.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All transfers of eligible leave credits shall be irrevocable.<br/>However, if the leave is not used within twelve (12) months<br/>of donation, it will revert to the donor.</p>
<p>16.12.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who received paid leave<br/>pursuant to this section shall use any leave credits that<br/>he/she continues to accrue on a monthly basis prior to<br/>receiving paid leave pursuant to this catastrophic illness<br/>benefit.</p>
<p>16.12.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated leave credits shall be used in the order donations<br/>are received. However, one day of leave will be used from<br/>each donor before a second day is utilized from any other<br/>donor. This sequential process will be repeated for all<br/>donation rounds thereafter.</p>
<p>16.12.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated eligible credits shall be utilized on a one to one<br/>ration (1:1). The recipient shall be paid at his/her rate of</p>
<p>pay.</p>
<p>16.12.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may adopt rules and regulations for the<br/>administration of this benefit as long as the regulations do<br/>not conflict with the specific provisions of the collective<br/>bargaining agreement. Such rules and regulations will be<br/>submitted to the Association for review prior to<br/>implementation.</p>

<p>Any district student or employee who harasses another student or employee through sex-<br/>based conduct or communication violates this policy.</p>

If a student engages in<br/>sexual harassment, remedial action may include discipline, up to and including expulsion.<br/>If an employee engages in sexual harassment, remedial action may include discipline, up<br/>to and including termination.</p>
<p>The Governing Board directs the Superintendent to establish administrative guidelines to<br/>implement the district's policy to provide a sexual harassment-free working and learning<br/>environment.</p>

<p>ADMINISTRATIVER REGULATION 4013 / 5133<br/>PERSONNEL: GENERAL</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment</p>
<p>I. Sexual Harassment Defined</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for<br/>sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual<br/>nature, made by someone from or in the work or educational setting, under<br/>any of the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submission to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or<br/>condition of an individual's employment, academic status, or<br/>progress.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submission to, or rejection of, the conduct is used as the basis of<br/>employment or academic decisions affecting the individual.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact<br/>upon the individual's work or academic performance, or of creating<br/>an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or educational<br/>environment. Even if the conduct or language is not sexual in nature,<br/>harassment based on the victim's gender may create a sexually<br/>discriminatory working or learning environment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submission to, or rejection of, the conduct is used as the basis for<br/>any decision affecting the individual regarding benefits and services,<br/>honors, programs, or activities available at or through the<br/>educational institution.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual harassment also includes any act of retaliation against a student or<br/>employee for reporting violations of this policy or for participating in the<br/>investigation of a sexual harassment complaint.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual Harassment Examples:</p>
<p>1. Sexual harassment can occur in a variety of circumstances.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim or the harasser may be a woman or a man, a girl or<br/>a boy; the victim does not have to be of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student can be the victim of sexual harassment by another<br/>student, the victim's teacher, another teacher, a principal, a<br/>counselor, a parent volunteer a coach, a custodian, an<br/>instructional aide, a school secretary, or any other agent or<br/>school district employee.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee can be the victim of sexual harassment by the<br/>victim's classified or certificated supervisor, a supervisor in<br/>another area, a co- worker, a student, an agent of the school<br/>district or someone who is neither an employee nor a student.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim does not have to be the person harassed but could<br/>be anyone affected by the offensive conduct.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual harassment can include, but is not limited to the following<br/>unwelcome conduct:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical: Leering; winking; throwing kisses; sexual gestures;<br/>deliberate touching; pinching; patting; leaning over; intentional<br/>rubbing or brushing against another individual's body;<br/>grabbing; fondling; kissing; cornering a person, blocking a<br/>person's way, or other physical interference with normal<br/>movement; attempted or actual rape or sexual assault; sexual<br/>intercourse.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal: Sexual demands; sexual propositions; sexual slurs;<br/>sexual jokes; sexual teasing; sexual remarks; sexual questions;<br/>sexual telephone calls; catcalls or whistles; derogatory<br/>comments; too-familiar remarks about an individual's body<br/>parts; repeated, unwanted requests or pressure for dates;<br/>requests for sexual activity; remarks or rumors about an<br/>individual's sexual activities; unwelcome compliments; telling<br/>about sexual fantasies.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual: Sexually explicit posters, graphics, cartoons, drawings,<br/>or objects; sexually suggestive looks, gestures, leers or<br/>gawking.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written: Notes or letters of a sexual nature; displays of sexually<br/>explicit literature, posters, or poems.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct prohibited by this policy need not be sexual in nature. Any<br/>conduct that is based on the victim's gender can constitute<br/>harassment. For example, referring to women or girls as &quot;chicks,&quot;<br/>&quot;broads,&quot; etc.; making statements about women or girls based on<br/>stereotypes; suggesting that women or girls should not hold certain<br/>positions because they are incapable of carrying out certain<br/>functions.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual conduct between an adult school employee and an elementary<br/>school student is never considered consensual. This policy will<br/>never deem an elementary school student to have welcomed or<br/>consented to an adult employee's sexually harassing conduct.</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>IE. Supervisors' and Managers' Responsibility</p>
<p>District supervisory and management employees must enforce the district's sexual<br/>harassment prohibition and must promptly report all sexual harassment complaints<br/>they receive from students or employees. A supervisor's or manager's failure to<br/>report a sexual harassment complaint is grounds for discipline.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality</p>
<p>The district will respect the confidentiality of the complainant and the individual(s)<br/>against whom the complaint is made as much as possible. The district will respect<br/>confidentiality within the limits of its legal obligations, including investigating<br/>sexual harassment allegations, and taking remedial and corrective action.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting Procedures</p>
<p>Any person who believes that a district student or employee has sexually harassed<br/>them or any person who knows or believes that they have knowledge of conduct<br/>that may constitute sexual harassment should report the alleged acts immediately.</p>

<p>BOARD POLICY 4020<br/>PERSONNEL; GENERAL</p>
<p>Equal Employment Opportunity: Affirmative Action in Employment &amp;<br/>Contracting: Harassment Prohibited</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Berryessa Union School District to assure equal employment<br/>opportunity and to prohibit discrimination in employment, promotion, compensation,<br/>training, transfer or assignment, based on race, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation,<br/>age, citizenship, national origin, challenging conditions or any other factors not related to<br/>job duties.</p>
<p>The District prohibits sexual harassment of employees, applicants for employment,<br/>students, and persons visiting school grounds and facilities. Employees and others who<br/>believe they have experienced sexual harassment are encouraged to file a complaint with<br/>the Superintendent under policy and administrative guidelines 4013: Sexual Harassment.</p>
<p>The District also prohibits harassment of employees and applicants for employment on<br/>the basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability,<br/>mental disability, medical condition, marital status, or sex, by District administrators or<br/>employees. “Harassment” includes verbal, physical, and visual forms of harassment.<br/>Employees who believe they have experienced prohibited harassment may file a<br/>complaint under the Board’s Miscellaneous Complaint policy.</p>
<p>Employees who have committed prohibited harassment will be disciplined in accordance<br/>with law and established procedures.</p>
<p>The Berryessa Union School District recognizes that mere prohibition of discriminatory<br/>practice is not enough to assure elimination of such practices. Affirmative, aggressive,<br/>well-directed action is needed to remedy the effects of past inequities and to assure that<br/>all possible barriers to employment of minorities and women are eliminated at all<br/>employment levels within the District. This includes aggressive efforts to recruit and<br/>assist minorities, as well as women or men in any occupational areas where either gender<br/>is under-utilized.</p>
<p>Bilingual and bicultural staff shall be selected where such qualifications are job related as<br/>required to meet the needs of bilingual/bicultural children. The applicant whose<br/>background and training is most appropriate for a specific position will be hired. Factors<br/>such as culture, background, and language will be considered important aspects.</p>
<p>The Berryessa Union School District, by this policy, is pledged to attain racial and gender<br/>parity between employees of Berryessa Union School District and the student population<br/>of Berryessa Union School District. Parity shall be attained at all responsibility levels<br/>and within every classification of both the certificated and classified work force.</p>
<p>The Board encourages community involvement in the hiring procedures of the District<br/>and endorses the committee concept as a method of achieving community participation in<br/>the employment process. Committees should be established to assist in the</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>implementation of the Affirmative Action Program. These committees shall be<br/>composed of citizens who reflect the racial/ethnic classifications of the community.</p>

<p>district employee, and any persons who know or believe that they have<br/>knowledge of conduct that may constitute harassment prohibited under these<br/>guidelines, to report the alleged conduct to their immediate supervisor, to any<br/>other district supervisor or manager, or to the Superintendent's Office.</p>
<p>Reporting acts of harassment immediately will enable the district to take<br/>corrective action and to take steps to prevent additional harassment.</p>

A supervisory or management employee receiving<br/>a verbal complaint shall immediately notify the Superintendent's Office,<br/>reduce the complaint to writing, and within a reasonable time after receiving<br/>the complaint, forward a written report to the</p>
<p>Superintendent's Office. Failure to report the complaint as required shall be</p>
<p>grounds</p>
<p>for discipline.</p>
<p>C. The Superintendent will investigate harassment complaints under the district's</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Complaint Policy. The time limits stated in administrative</p>
<p>guidelines under that policy may be waived by agreement of the district and</p>
<p>complainant.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reports findings of fact and supporting evidence;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concludes whether prohibited harassment did or did not occur with respect<br/>to each allegation in the complaint; and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommends corrective action.</p>

<p>□ Exceeds Standards &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meets Standards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;□&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not Meet Standards</p>
<p>An overall rating of “does not meet standards” is considered an unsatisfactory evaluation. The District is obligated to<br/>provide a written description of the unsatisfactory performance to the teacher and endeavor to provide assistance as<br/>required by Article 15 of the CTAB Collective Agreement and the Education Code.</p>
<p>If a tenured teacher is marked as “does not meet standards” in three of the six standards of the California Standards for<br/>the Teaching Profession (Performance Area “IN”), the teacher must participate in the PAR Program, and the evaluator<br/>must complete “Form 1” of the PAR provisions in “Appendix I” of the CTAB Collective Agreement.</p>
<p>Evaluator:</p>
<p>Date:</p>
<p>I have reviewed the above evaluation and have discussed the matter with the evaluator.</p>
<p>Employee:__Date:</p>
<p>The employee has a right to initiate a written response to this evaluation, which shall become a permanent<br/>attachment to the employee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE AREAS</p>
<p>The performance areas included in the evaluation for all teachers shall be:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student progress toward the District and state content standards; and</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance of professional responsibilities; and</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of the teacher according to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession. (These<br/>include items “2” through “5” of Section 15.1.1 of the CTAB Collective Agreement.)</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE LEVELS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>1. Ratings</p>
<p>The evaluator will mark each standard within every performance area in the evaluation</p>
<p>form, applying the ratings and definitions outlined below. This completed form must be</p>
<p>provided to the evaluated teacher no later than 30 calendar days before the last school</p>
<p>day of the school year.</p>
<p>Meets Standards - This means the teacher has adequately met the District’s</p>
<p>expectations.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of student progress, “meets standards” shall mean that the<br/>teacher in the aggregate has moved the students the equivalent of one year of<br/>progress from the starting point at the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of the teacher’s development according to the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP), “meets standards” shall mean<br/>that:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-tenured teacher is designated as at least “emerging” in a majority of the<br/>indicia for each standard; or</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tenured teacher is designated as at least “applying” in a majority of the indicia<br/>for each standard, except when the teacher has been assigned to a different grade<br/>or subject matter. In such instances the tenured teacher must meet the non-<br/>tenured standard.</p>
<p>Exceeds Standards - This means the teacher has exceeded the minimum standards as</p>
<p>defined above.</p>
<p>Below Standards - This means the teacher has not met the minimum standards as</p>
<p>defined above.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required Comments And Supporting Data</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required Comments</p>
<p>Any designation of “below standards” or “exceeds standards” must be<br/>accompanied by a written comment that memorializes an event or fact that either<br/>the evaluator observed or that is supported by data that is referenced.</p>
<p>A teacher being evaluated will be encouraged to provide relevant data at any<br/>time during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Required For Determining Student Progress</p>
<p>The students’ progress in achieving the District’s grade-level content standards<br/>shall be determined by multiple measures. These shall include the individual<br/>teacher’s written report card assessment, any testing device that measures the<br/>progress on District and state content standards, and in those instances where<br/>applicable, the state criterion referenced exam. Norm referenced tests may not<br/>be used to evaluate teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations As A Continuous Process And Required Formal Observations</p>
<p>Because Education Code Section 44664 requires the evaluation to be continuous in<br/>nature, the evaluation shall stress data collection during the entire evaluation period in<br/>preference to formal classroom observations.</p>
<p>Scheduled formal observations shall be required for non-tenured teacher only, which<br/>shall consist of a minimum of two formal observations, each accompanied by a post¬<br/>evaluation conference. Tenured teachers will receive a mid-year preliminary<br/>assessment before December 15 in the year of the scheduled evaluation. This<br/>preliminary assessment will consist of marking each indicia under performance area<br/>“HI” regarding the California Standards for the Teaching Profession. The sole purpose<br/>of this early assessment is to provide guidance to the teacher as to any area of potential<br/>deficiency. Only the year-end rating shall constitute the actual evaluation.</p>
<p>The lack of a required formal observation for tenured teachers, however, shall not<br/>excuse the administrator from meeting the required documentation or data collection<br/>required for any “below standards” rating.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required Conferences Between Evaluator And Teacher</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Evaluation Conference</p>
<p>The evaluating administrator must schedule and conduct an individual pre¬<br/>evaluation conference with every certificated employee before October 15 in the<br/>year in which the evaluation is scheduled. The purpose of this conference is to<br/>review the standards/indicia and rating system set forth in the evaluation form.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Observation Conference</p>
<p>The evaluating administrator must schedule and conduct a post-observation<br/>conference with the teacher within five days of the scheduled and formal<br/>observation.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary Evaluation Conference</p>
<p>The administrator doing the evaluation must schedule and conduct a conference<br/>with the teacher after submitting the written evaluation but before the last school<br/>day of the school year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options For Experienced Tenured Teachers</p>
<p>The standard form evaluation shall be used every other year for the required evaluation<br/>of a tenured teacher, unless mutually agreed otherwise by the individual teacher and the<br/>administrator. If requested by the teacher and agreed by the evaluating administrator,<br/>the following options shall be available in lieu of the standard form:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-Evaluation - The only requirement will be the pre-evaluation and the<br/>summary evaluation conference. For those teachers achieving the STBS<br/>National Certification, no approval for self-evaluation will be required.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer or Partner Coaching.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer or Partner Proj ect.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other option agreed to in writing by CTAB and the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Versus Coaching</p>
<p>The evaluating administrator is expected not only to act in the role of evaluator, but also<br/>under certain circumstances, to provide appropriate coaching. The primary role as the<br/>evaluator extends through the required determination as to whether the teacher meets<br/>District standards. Once this determination has been made, the administrator should be<br/>available to provide the necessary advice, direction, and coaching regarding<br/>improvement in the teacher’s proficiency in those areas covered by the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues Of Discipline And Evaluation</p>
<p>Issues of teacher discipline usually will not be included in the evaluation process, but<br/>will be addressed through the normal process of taking action against the employee at<br/>the time of the occurrence of unacceptable or inappropriate behavior. Discipline<br/>matters should not await the completion of the performance evaluation process.</p>

<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>APPENDIX G: FAMILY AND MEDICAL CARE LEAVE GUIDELINES</p>
<p>BERRYESSA UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>UNPAID FAMILY AND MEDIC AT, CARE LEAVE GUIDELINES</p>
<p>The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and California Family Rights Act of 1992 (CFRA)<br/>provide eligible employees with rights to a specified amount of unpaid Family and Medical Care Leave.</p>
<p>ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>Employees who work for the District for at least 1250 hours in past 12 months and have been employed for at<br/>least 12 months. (Full-time teachers are deemed to meet the 1250 hours).</p>
<p>LEAVE ENTITLEMENT</p>
<p>Eligible employees are entitled up to a total of 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during a 12-month period. (See<br/>“Accrued Leave” provisions below for use of paid leave.) Leave entitlement under state and federal laws<br/>generally run concurrently except that an employee’s entitlement to pregnancy disability leave under<br/>California law is in addition to the 12-week family care and medical leave entitlement provided by state law.</p>
<p>Intermittent Leave may be taken in separate blocks of time due to a single illness or injury involving<br/>periodic, as opposed to continuous treatment. The blocks can vary in size from an hour (or less) to weeks.<br/>Example: taking time for medical treatments on an irregular basis or on a regular basis such as a regimen of<br/>chemotherapy or physical therapy.</p>
<p>Reduced Leave Schedule is a reduction in the normal work schedule when medically necessary for personal<br/>or family illness (employer may limit its use in childbirth or placement situations).</p>
<p>FMLA Limits - when both husband and wife are employed by the District, they are limited to a combined<br/>total of 12 weeks of FMLA Leave in a 12 month period for birth, adoption or foster care, or the care of a<br/>parent with a serious health condition. The FMLA entitlement for spouses employed by the District is not<br/>limited or combined for any other qualifying purpose.</p>
<p>REASONS AN EMPLOYEE CAN TAKE A FAMILY AND MEDICAL CARE LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birth, adoption or foster care of child.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition. A<br/>serious health conditions is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical mental condition which<br/>involves:</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any period of incapacity or treatment connected with in-patient care (i.e.: an overnight stay)<br/>in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility, or</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any period of incapacity that requires an absence from work or school or other regular daily<br/>activities of more than three calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by or<br/>under the supervision of a health care provider, or</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>CTAB<br/>Version 7</p>
<p>* continuing treatment by or under the supervision of a health care provider for a health<br/>condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period of<br/>incapacity of more than three calendar days.</p>
<p>3. A personal serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform job functions.<br/>Disability on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions is covered by pregnancy<br/>disability leave (CFRA).</p>
<p>ACCRUED LEAVE</p>
<p>Accrued paid sick leave can be substituted for unpaid family care and medical leave when the requested leave<br/>is for the employee’s own serious health condition or when the request is based upon birth or placement of a<br/>child or care of a family member as described in paragraph 2 above. The substituted paid sick leave must<br/>be accrued and available for a purpose recognized under leaves pursuant to Board Policies or the<br/>collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>HEALTH BENEFITS</p>
<p>The District must continue to provide group health benefits on the same basis as coverage would have been<br/>maintained had the employee not taken leave. Under federal law, the employer’s obligation to maintain<br/>coverage ends if an employee’s premium payment, if any, is more than 30 days late or if the employee fails to<br/>return to work. Regardless of an employee’s failure to keep up premium payment, all benefits must be<br/>reinstated to a returning employee.</p>
<p>RETURN FROM LEAVE</p>
<p>An employee is entitled to return to the same position or an equivalent position with equivalent terms and<br/>conditions of employment.</p>
<p>WHAT TO DO TO REQUEST FMLA LEAVE</p>
<p>Employees must fill out the following required forms and submit to the Personnel Department 30 days prior to<br/>leave when leave is “foreseeable.” If need is not foreseen, give notice as soon as “practicable”:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Request for FMLA Leave, and</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification Relating to Care for Seriously 111 Family Member, or</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification of Physician or Practitioner</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Medical Leave Agreement to Reimburse</p>

<p>School District, a public school district organized under the laws and constitution of the</p>
<p>State of California, (&quot;District&quot;) and_, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a</p>
<p>Berryessa Union School District certificated employee (&quot;Teacher&quot;).</p>
<p>RECITALS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District desires to develop electronic curricular materials and instructional texts<br/>(&quot;products&quot;) based upon copyrighted District curriculum frameworks, for use in<br/>California public school education.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District will release from regular duties those teachers the District selects to<br/>participate in product development projects. District will place these teachers on<br/>appropriate paid leave, to enable the teachers to participate in product<br/>development.

District retains full copyright rights in all District<br/>curriculum and other materials, and in all materials derived from District<br/>curriculum materials, including all instructional texts and other products, except<br/>to the extent District specifically licenses those rights to others.</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Teacher spends working on product development projects under this<br/>Agreement is time Teacher spends &quot;at work for District.&quot;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher shall perform project development work for the District. This work shall<br/>consist of those services described in the Scope of Services, attached as Exhibit 1<br/>and incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. The Scope of Services<br/>may be amended from time to time in writing by Teacher and District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher shall participate in product development projects for a portion of the<br/>workweek or work year as determined by District in District's sole discretion.</p>

<p>3.2 For Beginning Teachers (Refer also to Diagram “2”)</p>

<p>3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Participating Teachers are expected to be high<br/>performing individuals who wish to grow and learn with the<br/>assistance from a peer, or who may be seeking assistance due to a<br/>change in assignment or the institution of new curriculum. The<br/>Program for Voluntary Participating Teachers will focus on<br/>practical application of certain teaching skills or the acquisition of<br/>a new subject matter. Each year the Joint Panel, in consultation<br/>with the District administration, may select certain curricular areas<br/>or skills for emphasis with a select number of Consulting Teachers.</p>
<p>3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For teachers on a self-evaluation cycle specified by Section 15.2 of<br/>the Agreement, the volunteering teacher must first submit to the<br/>evaluating Principal a written plan for a self-evaluation, including<br/>the name of any preferred Consulting Teacher. If the plan is<br/>approved by the evaluating administrator and involves a<br/>Consulting Teacher, the plan will be submitted to the Joint Panel<br/>for the assignment of a Consulting Teacher. If the Joint Panel<br/>assigns a Consulting Teacher, the Consulting Teacher shall meet<br/>with the Principal and the Voluntary Participating Teacher for<br/>planning and coordinating the plan. The process for utilizing<br/>Consulting Teachers for professional growth on off-cycle years<br/>shall be the same as above, except that the procedures for<br/>evaluation contained in Article 15 of the Agreement will not be<br/>followed.</p>
<p>3.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because permanent teachers with satisfactory performance are not<br/>mandated by law to participate in the Program, neither the<br/>Consulting Teacher nor the Panel will forward to the Board the<br/>names of volunteer teacher participants. Any reports to the<br/>Governing Board or the Joint Panel will be made only as required<br/>by the individual plan.
