<p>Time Limits</p>

<p>2) In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be<br/>processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end<br/>of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the<br/>following school year, could result in irreparable harm to an aggrieved<br/>person, the time hmits set forth herein will be reduced so that the<br/>procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as<br/>soon as is practicable.</p>

In such instance, he/she shall follow the procedures of this<br/>section.</p>
<p>Level Five: Binding Arbitration matters relating to alleged violations of this<br/>agreement only, not officially adopted Board Pohcy or teacher dismissals.</p>

<p>The Association and District should attempt to agree upon an arbitrator; and<br/>if no agreement can be reached, the parties request that the California State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service supply a panel of seven (7) names of<br/>persons experienced in hearing grievances in pubhc schools. Each party shall<br/>strike a name until only one (l) name remains.</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the District<br/>and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring<br/>them.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence, and render a decision<br/>on the issues that were submitted for arbitration.</p>
<p>If the parties cannot agree upon the submission statement, the arbitrator<br/>shall determine the issues by referring to the written grievance<br/>documentation and the answers at each level of the process.</p>
<p>In disputed cases concerning whether a grievance claim is within the scope of<br/>these proceedings, the arbitrator shall first rule on the aptness of the issue<br/>before proceeding to the merits of the issue.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change, add to, or<br/>subtract from any of the terms of this Agreement, but shall determine only<br/>whether or not there has been a violation of this Agreement as alleged in the<br/>grievance. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the<br/>evidence, and the argument presented to him or her by the respective parties<br/>in the presence of each other. The arbitrator shall have no power to estabhsh<br/>or recommend any financial award except for back pay. General and punitive<br/>damages shall not be awarded in any case.</p>

<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal a grievance to the next<br/>step within the specified time hmits shall preclude any further appeal<br/>on the grievance.
