In delineating the reserved rights of the District, it is not the intention of<br/>the parties to detract from or diminish in any way the statutory right of the<br/>Association to represent unit members under the Act.</p>
<p>It is agreed that all matters which are beyond the scope of negotiations as provided in<br/>Government Code. Section 3543.2 and also all rights, powers, and authority which<br/>are not limited by the terms of this Agreement are reserved to the District. Such<br/>reserved rights shall include, but are not limited to, the exclusive right to:</p>

<p>The exercise of the foregoing rights, powers, authority, duties and responsibilities by<br/>the District, the adoption of policies, rules, regulations, and practices in furtherance<br/>thereof, and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith, shall be<br/>limited only by the specific express terms of this Agreement, by statutory rights of<br/>unit members and/or the Association, and then only to the extent such specific and<br/>express terms are in conformance with law. If there is a direct conflict between the<br/>aforementioned reserved rights of management and the specific and express<br/>provisions of other articles of this Agreement, the language of the latter shall prevail.</p>
<p>The District retains its right to amend, modify, or rescind policies and practices<br/>referred to in this Agreement for the duration of an emergency. An emergency shall<br/>be defined as those unforeseen circumstances which substantially interrupt or<br/>threaten to interrupt the normal District operation: natural disasters, epidemics, riots,<br/>police actions, national emergencies, local exigencies.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During operation hours the District agrees, upon twenty-four (24) hour<br/>advance request and approval of the site manager verifying that there will be<br/>no conflict created in the use of the facility on the date and at the time<br/>requested, to grant to the Association access to lounges, faculty dining rooms,<br/>or other designated locations for the transaction of Association business with<br/>employees on non-duty time as provided in Section C.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees that upon advance request the immediate manager of a<br/>school or office may grant TALB the occasional use of District computers,<br/>copiers, and other communication or media equipment under the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of equipment occurs on non-duty time of the employee who must<br/>also be qualified to use the equipment;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use does not interrupt or interfere with the normal student educational<br/>program or work production of District employees who need to use<br/>the equipment;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before June 30 of each year, TALB agrees to remit to the<br/>District $1,000 (K-12 and CDC/Head Start inclusive) as<br/>reimbursement for the occasional use of District equipment.

<p>IV-7</p>
<p>ARTICLE V</p>
<p>Days and Hours of Employment</p>
<p>WORKDAY:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the professional duties of employees require both on-site and<br/>off-site hours of work, that the varying nature of such professional duties may<br/>not lend itself to a total maximum daily work time of definite or uniform<br/>length, and that such duties are normally expected to involve no fewer than<br/>eight (8) hours of total effort each workday for both classroom and non¬<br/>classroom employees.</p>
<p>It is further agreed that employees will be available to meet with students and<br/>parents at reasonable times before and after the instructional day. A schedule<br/>shall be posted prominently and maintained at each school site indicating<br/>times when teachers are available to meet with parents and/or students.<br/>Copies of the schedule shall be sent home to parents twice a year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the elementary schools, teachers shall report for duty and check their<br/>mailboxes not later than fifteen (15) minutes before the opening of class<br/>except when assigned before school duties. Teachers shall remain until after<br/>the close of the last scheduled class of the day for Grades 4 and 5 (except on<br/>Friday), unless they have an after school duty, are excused earlier or are<br/>requested to remain by the principal. On Fridays, teachers may leave the<br/>building immediately upon the close of the regular school day for pupils,<br/>(afternoon kindergarten teachers may arrive at school fifteen (15) minutes later<br/>than the start of their regular duty day), except that if District meetings are<br/>scheduled on Friday another &quot;early day&quot; may be designated. Teachers of<br/>kindergarten and the first three grades remain on duty as long as teachers of<br/>the fourth and fifth grades, unless excused earlier by the principal. All<br/>kindergarten teachers (including those without team partners) shall meet their<br/>classes for 200 minutes each day and work two hours beyond such time either<br/>with their class or in other kindergarten classrooms. Note: Unless and until<br/>negotiated otherwise, the extended or full day kindergarten will remain<br/>voluntary, but no contractual waiver is required.</p>
<p>Teachers assigned to elementary school libraries work a seven-hour day,<br/>except on Friday when they may leave fifteen (15) minutes prior to the end of<br/>their regularly assigned workday.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle and senior high schools teachers shall, unless assigned to before<br/>school duty, report for duty as least fifteen (15) minutes before the opening of<br/>the first assigned class, conference period, or homeroom/advisory and shall<br/>check their mailboxes daily before the instructional day begins. Teachers</p>
<p>V-l</p>
<p>shall be present on site for an additional sixty (60) minutes weekly as selected<br/>at the professional discretion of the teacher. If District meetings are<br/>scheduled on Friday another “early day” may be designated.</p>
<p>Historically, the secondary teacher workday is comprised of six periods (one<br/>of which is a conference period). If a teacher volunteers to teach an additional<br/>class during his/her conference period his/her instructional day is extended<br/>approximately one hour before or after the regular instructional day to provide<br/>the employee with the conference period allowed for in this Agreement.</p>
<p>4. During any school month, teachers may be required to attend on-site meetings<br/>not to exceed a total of six (6) hours beyond the instructional day. Two (2) of<br/>the six (6) hourly monthly meetings are at the discretion of the bargaining unit<br/>and principal. The necessity for conducting the two (2) hourly meetings shall<br/>be determined monthly at each site by either a simple majority secret ballot<br/>vote of the bargaining unit employees who actually vote on the proposal and<br/>principal or by the site shared decision-making body. The determination of<br/>which process will be used shall be by an annual majority secret ballot vote of<br/>the bargaining unit and principal.</p>
<p>Attendance is required at only those meetings authorized by the principal.<br/>Such meetings may be held before or after school and should be<br/>approximately one hour or less in length. Site meetings beyond the<br/>instructional day in a typical school month would include two (2) faculty<br/>meetings and two (2) other meetings; such as, grade level, department,<br/>program review and/or in-service. In the event of a school or District<br/>emergency, or urgent school business, principals may call additional meetings<br/>with the approval of the appropriate assistant/deputy superintendent.</p>
<p>Special education teachers may be required to attend one off-site in-service<br/>meeting per month as authorized by the Assistant Superintendent, Special<br/>Education. Such off-site meetings beyond the instructional day should be<br/>approximately one hour or less in length and will be included in the monthly<br/>computation.</p>
<p>During the term of this Agreement, the District shall maintain its practice of<br/>treating IEP meetings as mandatory; bargaining unit members attending such<br/>meetings beyond the duty day and in excess of four hours per month shall be<br/>paid therefore at their regular hourly rate provided they submit the<br/>Documentation of Mandatory Meeting Form to the Superintendent’s Special<br/>Education Committee.</p>
<p>5. The on-site workday for other unit members shall be as follows:</p>
<p>On-site work hours for secondary school librarians and program facilitators<br/>shall be eight (8) hours per day exclusive of lunch, except Friday when they</p>
<p>may leave twenty (20) minutes prior to the end of their regularly assigned<br/>workday.</p>
<p>On-site work hours for nurses shall be seven and one-half (7.5) hours per day<br/>exclusive of lunch, except Friday when they may leave twenty (20) minutes<br/>prior to the end of their regularly assigned workday. If the principal or his/her<br/>designee determines it is necessary for the employee to remain on-site to<br/>perform the assigned duties of the position or to fulfill his/her professional<br/>obligations appropriate to his/her assignment, the principal or his/her designee<br/>shall direct the employee to remain on-site up to a maximum of eight (8) hours<br/>a day.</p>
<p>Modifications of the on-site work hours and the &quot;early day&quot; may be mutually<br/>agreed to by the employee and the site manager to accommodate a variety of<br/>job responsibilities that may be accomplished at a location other than the<br/>school site and/or outside of normal working hours. Driving time between<br/>District sites shall be included as part of the normal working day exclusive of<br/>the duty-free lunch period.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modification in the students' schedule shall have no effect on the unit member's<br/>workday as described above, except for Back-to-School Night in the fall and<br/>Open House during one night of Public Schools Week in the spring. Additional<br/>exceptions may be approved by the appropriate assistant/deputy superintendent.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that in carrying out job responsibilities, each employee shall<br/>perform many duties and adjunct responsibilities which occur outside of the<br/>scheduled minimum on-site duty day. Such duties may involve activities such<br/>as supervision of pupils, sponsorship of student activities, and participation in<br/>school, districtwide, and parent-community committees. It is intended that such<br/>adjunct duties will be assumed equitably by all unit members. Volunteers will<br/>be sought and a site shared decision-making process may be used to distribute<br/>adjunct duties; however, if there are insufficient volunteers, the manager retains<br/>the right to assign unit members to meet the needs of the school. The<br/>maximum expectancy for any secondary school teacher shall be twenty-four<br/>(24) hours per semester, exclusive of faculty/department meetings.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members shall be entitled to the statutory minimum duty-free lunch<br/>period of thirty (30) minutes. This entitlement also refers to alternate lunch<br/>schedules adopted because of inclement weather. Normally, teachers can<br/>expect to have the same length of lunch period as students except that the site<br/>manager may assign employees to supervisory duties during the passing<br/>periods and/or to meet the occasional needs of the school lunch period<br/>situation.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduled preparation period at the secondary level is defined as paid<br/>working time for the specific purposes of preparing materials; conferring with</p>
<p>students, parents, support staff, and administrators; and other duties subject to<br/>assignment by the principal. It may also, if deemed necessary by the immediate<br/>site manager, be used for providing replacement services (class coverage) for a<br/>temporarily absent unit member.</p>
<p>Replacement service may be required when another teacher is absent, no<br/>substitute is immediately available and, in the judgment of the administrator, no<br/>other certificated employee is available. Over the course of the school year the<br/>site manager shall distribute these occasional replacement assignments as<br/>equitably as possible among all available non-classroom certificated personnel<br/>and unit members. A record of equitable assignments shall be accessible to<br/>employees. When a unit member is assigned to provide such replacement<br/>service, the first two (2) hours, cumulative, per school year of such service shall<br/>be deducted from the employee's maximum expectancy (twenty-four [24] hours<br/>per semester) for adjunct duties. When a unit member is assigned to provide<br/>replacement service in excess of two (2) hours, cumulative, the unit member<br/>shall be paid for such excess service at the substitute hourly rate. Schedule N,<br/>and shall be required to remain on-site after his/her duty day for an<br/>equivalent number of minutes of preparation.</p>
<p>Efforts will be made to assign non-bargaining unit employees to provide<br/>replacement service. If a bargaining unit member who has been asked to<br/>provide replacement service is relieved by such an employee within the first<br/>twenty (20) minutes of service, the bargaining unit member will be credited<br/>with thirty (30) minutes of coverage. If the coverage time is in excess of<br/>twenty (20) minutes, the employee shall be provided with one (1) hour of credit<br/>for replacement service.</p>
<p>10. Elementary Preparation:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the elementary school, limited preparation time may be arranged at<br/>individual school sites through staffing patterns that (1) are<br/>educationally justifiable; (2) do not reduce total instruction time for<br/>students; (3) are developed jointly by the affected teaching staff and<br/>the site manager; and (4) are approved by the appropriate<br/>assistant/deputy superintendent.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the elementary teacher's discretion, library time may be used as a<br/>preparation period when a credentialed librarian is scheduled to work<br/>with the entire class.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school is not precluded from identifying additional opportunities for<br/>preparation time, especially for teachers of grades four and five, if the<br/>school's regularly scheduled, general funded, certificated staffing<br/>permits.</p>
<p>V-4</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers in Grades 1-5 shall receive a designated preparation time of<br/>40 minutes on dates identified by the District. Thursday shall be the<br/>scheduled preparation day which shall remain the same for all affected<br/>schools within the District. The dates shall be identified prior to the<br/>start of the new school year. The instructional minutes for Grades 1<br/>through 5 must be consistent with the instructional minutes identified<br/>by the District for the particular grade level. Preparation periods shall<br/>normally be scheduled 35 times a year; but may be less in some years<br/>due to the placement of school holidays on the approved calendar.<br/>Scheduled preparation days shall not be changed due to conflicts on<br/>the calendar, such as Back-to-School Night, Open House and Parent<br/>Conferences.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in cases of emergencies, no meetings shall be scheduled by the<br/>site administrator during the scheduled preparation period. However,<br/>this does not preclude a teacher from scheduling and participating in<br/>meetings of their choice during this time.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No waivers shall be accepted or approved to modify the 40-minute<br/>preparation period for teachers.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The designated 40-minute preparation period is part of the teachers’<br/>regular workday.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who request and are granted a part-time assignment shall have a<br/>minimum on-site responsibility exclusive of any duty-free lunch period<br/>proportionate to their contract assignment. Elementary part-time teachers<br/>who teach half of the normal instructional time shall have a workday that is<br/>one-half (1/2) the workday of a full-time teacher. Secondary part-time<br/>teachers who are assigned to three (3) instructional periods shall have a<br/>workday that is one-half (1/2) the workday of a full time teacher; other<br/>workdays shall be based upon the principle that exclusive of the lunch period,<br/>six (6) periods plus required time before and after classes constitute a full¬<br/>time assignment. Teachers who work less than full-time shall not be<br/>scheduled for a preparation period as part of the workday. Employees who<br/>work half-time or less shall be exempt from all extra-duty responsibilities<br/>except for faculty meetings which are contiguous with the employee’s<br/>workday and annual open house activities.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Section shall not apply to teachers in the Outdoor<br/>Education Program.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructional Day.</p>
<p>The hours of employment defined in Sections A.I., A.2., and A.3. above shall<br/>include at least the required number of instructional minutes to qualify for</p>
<p>V-5</p>

<p>Kindergarten &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36,000</p>
<p>Grades 1,2, and 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50,400</p>
<p>Grades 4 and 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54,000</p>
<p>Grades 6, 7, and 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,800</p>
<p>Grades 9,10, 11, and 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,800</p>
<p>except that:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools with an organizational pattern of Grades K-8 shall provide a<br/>minimum of 54,000 instructional minutes for Grades 7 and 8.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools which exceed the above required minimum number of<br/>instructional minutes for specified grade levels shall make no<br/>adjustment to reduce the number of instructional minutes at these<br/>grade levels without the express written consent of the appropriate<br/>assistant/deputy superintendent.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In year-round schools, the number of minimum days established in<br/>1987-1988 shall be at least maintained in subsequent years with</p>
<p>utilization determined at the site except for contractually identified<br/>minimum days.</p>
<p>14. Job Sharing:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Job Sharing Program is one in which two (2) employees share the<br/>full responsibilities and the contract of employment of one (1)<br/>identifiable full-time position. The shared teaching assignment shall<br/>be (1) fifty-fifty (50-50) percent or (2) sixty-forty (60-40) percent.<br/>The sharing shall be on a proportional division of the school day or of<br/>the school week.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants must be willing to provide a written commitment to serve a<br/>minimum of one (1) year in the shared position. If, because of<br/>extenuating circumstances, one of the participants cannot continue in<br/>a part-time assignment during the year, the District is under no<br/>obligation to return the individual to a full-time assignment until the<br/>following year; but the District may consider an earlier return if a<br/>position is available.</p>
<p>Job Share participants may be either permanent or non-permanent<br/>teachers. If a teacher is not permanent at the time of either application<br/>or assignment, he/she shall be required to sign a statement<br/>acknowledging his/her understanding that years of service which are</p>
<p>V-6</p>
<p>less than one hundred (100) percent will not be credited towards the<br/>employee’s attainment of permanent status.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing assignments shall be filled only by teachers who have<br/>jointly requested to work together. A listing of teachers interested in<br/>job sharing will be maintained by both the Certificated Personnel<br/>Office and the Teachers Association.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants shall submit a joint written application to the affected site<br/>managers) showing the names of the participants, positions affected,<br/>the proposed sharing schedule, division of adjunct duties, and the<br/>potential benefit to students. Mutual agreement between the two (2)<br/>employees, the principal, the appropriate assistant/deputy<br/>superintendent, and the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resource<br/>Services, is required before the job sharing assignment can be<br/>implemented. Applications shall be submitted on or before March 1.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual job sharing assignments will normally be evaluated prior to<br/>March 1. A decision with respect to continuance of each program will<br/>be made on or before April 15.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary will be the prorated share of the amount an employee<br/>would have earned had the employee not elected to exercise the<br/>option to participate in job sharing. The contribution to STRS/PERS<br/>will be based upon the amount of salary actually earned by the<br/>participant.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharers will receive full District health and welfare benefits. The<br/>District will contribute premiums on a prorated basis and participants<br/>will pay the remainder of the required premiums. Employees not<br/>opting for District health coverage shall provide evidence of health<br/>insurance from another source.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee in a shared assignment will receive all contractual<br/>leaves on a prorated basis.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee on shared assignment is absent, the other party,<br/>whenever possible and with the approval of the site manager, will<br/>trade days with his/her partner or will agree to substitute for his/her<br/>partner in a regular substitute status at the regular substitute rate.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee on a shared contract will be expected to participate in<br/>professional responsibilities such as, but not limited to, the following:<br/>participation in school, district-wide, and parent-community<br/>committees; faculty meetings; Back-to-School Night activities;</p>
<p>V-7</p>
<p>parent/teacher conferences; report card preparation. Details of shared<br/>responsibilities are defined in the application.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, because of extenuating circumstances, one partner cannot continue<br/>in the shared assignment, one of the following shall occur:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining participant fills the previously shared position<br/>on a full-time basis;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new partner, mutually agreeable to parties, replaces the non¬<br/>continuing partner;</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining participant applies for a leave for which<br/>he/she is eligible.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining participant submits his or her resignation.</p>
<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation of any job sharing partnership is contingent upon the<br/>annual mutual agreement of all parties.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to approval of any job sharing agreement the two teachers<br/>involved shall agree which of them shall remain at the site should the<br/>partnership be dissolved and both desire full-time assignment at that<br/>site but only one opening exists. In any circumstance, participants<br/>would have access to the District's voluntary transfer procedure.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/Teacher Conferences. K-5 classroom teachers in a K-5 or K-8<br/>school shall have six (6) minimum days in the fall and two (2) minimum days<br/>in the spring for parent/teacher conferences.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library Media Centers will close during the final week of school to<br/>allow LMTs time to close the library, conduct inventory, and complete<br/>other oversight tasks that are essential to running an effective library<br/>media program. The standard period for closing a library media center<br/>shall equal the number of days it is scheduled to be open during a<br/>regular week during the school year; the LMT in consultation with the<br/>site administrator may recommend a lesser or greater period depending<br/>upon the size of the center.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary level, the LMT at his/her discretion may continue to<br/>utilize a flexible schedule in order to service the entire school. At the<br/>elementary level, the LMTs may utilize flexible scheduling for 20% of<br/>their scheduled work week at that particular site in order to permit<br/>collaborations with classroom teachers and their students for in-depth<br/>learning and research.</p>
<p>B WORK YEAR:</p>
<p>1. Teachers (including nurses, teachers on special assignment, and librarians):</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional Schedule. The assigned work year shall be from the first<br/>day of the fall semester to the last day of the spring semester,<br/>inclusive.

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on identified program needs and the availability of sufficient<br/>special project funds at individual school sites, program facilitators<br/>may request election for additional service either before or after the<br/>regularly assigned work year, or during designated non-work periods<br/>at year-round schools.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Split Assignments. In cases of split assignments, employees so affected shall</p>
<p>work each assigned day a number of hours which reflects the employee’s<br/>assignments. A split assignment refers to a full-time employee whose contract<br/>assignment includes two job classifications (Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher/program</p>
<p>facilitator).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency. In the event of an emergency or other event resulting in less than<br/>the scheduled number of workdays, the District agrees to consult with the<br/>Association before determining the number and dates of specific days to be<br/>rescheduled to ensure the total contract workdays for all unit employees.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holidays. The District agrees to grant all employees those non-paid, legal and<br/>Board-designated holidays which occur during their specified traditional or<br/>year-round calendars.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal holidays shall include Independence Day, Admission Day,<br/>Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, New<br/>Year's Day, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Lincoln Day, Presidents<br/>Day, and Memorial Day.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a legal holiday falls on Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be<br/>observed as a holiday. When a legal holiday falls on Sunday, the<br/>following Monday shall be observed as a holiday.</p>
<p>V-10</p>
<p>d. Consistent with the above provisions, the date of each holiday shall be<br/>set forth in the calendar (see Appendix A).</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer School and Intersession Programs. Teachers elected to provide<br/>additional service during summer school on traditional calendar or intersession<br/>programs on year-round calendars will be compensated per Salary Schedule P.</p>
<p>Note: Any changes in leave provisions or other benefits as a result of the<br/>collective bargaining process will apply equally to summer school and<br/>intersession program teachers.</p>
<p>All eligible employees will have an opportunity to apply to teach during<br/>intersession or summer school. All employees whose most recent final<br/>evaluation is satisfactory in all areas directly related to classroom instruction<br/>and student achievement are eligible for selection for summer school and<br/>intersession employment. Applicants will be selected based upon (a) the<br/>needs of the program to be offered and (b) when applicable, a system of<br/>rotation after having served three consecutive intersessions or summer school<br/>assignments if there are other qualified applicants. When the above<br/>considerations are substantially comparable, decisions shall be based upon<br/>length of service in the District.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intersession Substitute Service. Employees assigned to year-round schools<br/>are eligible to apply to substitute during their intersession/recess periods. All<br/>employees whose most recent final evaluation is satisfactory in all areas<br/>directly related to classroom instruction and student achievement are<br/>eligible.</p>
<p>When serving as a substitute teacher at any school other than the school to<br/>which they are regularly assigned, they shall be paid as per Salary Schedule N.<br/>When serving as a substitute teacher at the school to which they are regularly<br/>assigned, they shall be paid at the same daily rate as that earned by Home<br/>School substitutes.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoor Education Program. To meet the needs of the Outdoor Education<br/>Program, adjustments may be made in calendared workdays. Any workdays<br/>beyond one hundred eighty-two (182) will be voluntary additional assignment.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveling Teachers in Secondary Schools. Except in the most extraordinary<br/>circumstances, secondary teachers serving in their initial year in the profession<br/>will not be scheduled as traveling teachers.</p>
<p>C ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION FOR YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULES:</p>
<p>1. Roving Teachers. Roving teachers agree to change classrooms approximately<br/>every four weeks to enable three other teachers to remain in/retum to the same</p>
<p>V-ll</p>
<p>classroom throughout the year. An employee identified as a roving teacher at<br/>a year-round site will be entitled to utilize a total number of classroom aide<br/>hours which is ten (10) percent greater than the total number of classroom<br/>aide hours allocated to other teachers in the same grade level (elementary) or<br/>the same subject area (middle school) at the same school site. In addition,<br/>roving teachers may be given some special considerations developed<br/>cooperatively at the site; i.e., no recess or hall duty, assistance with bulletin<br/>boards, single level classes, reduction of adjunct responsibilities, etc.</p>
<p>Roving teacher assignments will be filled by volunteers. In the event that<br/>there is not a volunteer roving teacher, all four teachers may be required to<br/>change classrooms when returning from intersession. Except in the most<br/>extraordinary circumstances, teachers serving in their initial year in the<br/>profession will not be assigned to a roving position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intent of the District that employees be arbitrarily reassigned or<br/>rotated from one track to another.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a minimum, the District shall provide one movable storage unit per four<br/>classroom teachers. Each teacher shall be assigned a storage space which can<br/>be locked.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the goal of the District that the temperature of the classroom will be<br/>conducive to teaching and learning throughout the school year. At a<br/>minimum, some type of mechanical cooling device will be available for each<br/>classroom at each year-round school site.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize that some factors that relate to year-round scheduling at<br/>the middle school and are within the scope of bargaining may not have been<br/>addressed. Should problems arise because of such unanticipated factors, the<br/>parties agree to meet for the purpose of resolving those issues.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the approval of the site administrator, teachers may exchange days with<br/>other teachers who are on different tracks or calendars at the same school site.<br/>Participating teachers shall submit a signed agreement indicating the days they<br/>are exchanging at least five days in advance of the exchange to the site<br/>administrator for approval. Teachers who are unable to fulfill the conditions<br/>of the agreement shall be charged appropriate leave for those days on which<br/>they were absent and which they were not able to make up. The District will<br/>not be held liable for a teacher who does not fulfill his/her exchange days.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll Errors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper salary class and step placement is a joint</p>
<p>responsibility of the employee and the District. All employees are<br/>encouraged to review their salary placement annually and should they believe<br/>that they are improperly placed on the salary schedule, they should<br/>immediately bring this information to the attention of the District. In the<br/>event that an incorrect salary placement results in an underpayment, the<br/>District will issue a warrant for approximately ninety (90) percent of the net<br/>underpayment from the revolving fund within ten (10) working days from the<br/>day the error has been verified and Payroll receives written notification. Full<br/>adjustment will be reflected in the employee's next regular pay warrant.<br/>Should the incorrect salary placement result in an overpayment, the employee<br/>will reimburse the District the full amount of such overpayment on a<br/>repayment schedule developed by the District and the employee. In the event<br/>of an error favoring the employee or the District, the error shall be corrected<br/>retroactively for a period of up to three (3) years dating from the discovery of<br/>the error. &quot;Discovery of the error&quot; is defined as the date the District or the<br/>employee first receives written notification.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee requests an audit of payroll records beyond the<br/>immediately preceding thirty-six (36) months, the employee will be<br/>charged for this service at the rate of $20 per hour. The service fee<br/>will be waived if the audit reveals an actual error. The employee may<br/>request an estimate of the time involved in the audit prior to<br/>authorizing Payroll to proceed.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within two years of receipt of the annual service credit statement<br/>from the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS)ZPublic<br/>Employees Retirement System (PERS), employees may request<br/>review of a perceived discrepancy in annual service as reported in<br/>that statement.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual salary of any employee who is employed after the<br/>beginning of the school year, or who resigns, retires, is terminated, or<br/>goes on unpaid leave prior to the end of the school year shall be<br/>computed by comparing the number of days actually worked by the<br/>employee (including absence days in paid status) to the total number<br/>of working days in the school year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Assignments; Bargaining unit employees qualified for<br/>additional teaching assignments in School for Adults and/or summer school<br/>shall be given priority consideration.

<p>sheltered annuity plans, including the 403(b) plan, through voluntary payroll<br/>deduction. The District shall pay the fees, if any, of a third party<br/>administrator who will be responsible for plan administration and<br/>compliance. The District shall consult with TALB when considering a<br/>change in the 403(b) third party administrator.</p>
<p>B HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS:</p>
<p>1. Employee Eligibility. Bargaining unit employees working fifty (50) percent<br/>or more of a full-time assignment as defined in Article V, Section A ll.,<br/>(exclusive of job sharing. Article V, Section A. 14.) are eligible for health,<br/>dental, vision, and life insurance benefits as provided in this Article.<br/>Effective 2010-11, the employer contribution shall be pro-rated for less-than-<br/>full-time unit members.</p>
<p>a. All coverage is effective the first day of paid service or first paid day<br/>upon return from unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>VI-3</p>
<p>b. Any employee in unpaid leave status for a period in excess of thirty (30) calendar<br/>days may continue health and welfare benefit coverage as provided in this Article by<br/>personally paying the premiums. The percent of the annual premiums to be paid<br/>shall be the same as the percent of the contract year during which the employee is in<br/>unpaid leave status. (For example, a one hundred eight-two [182] workday teacher<br/>on unpaid leave for one [1] semester, i.e., ninety-one [91]</p>
<p>days, is responsible for fifty (50) percent of the annual benefit<br/>premiums.)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective 9/1/06, an employee who fails to enroll during open<br/>enrollment or within thirty (30) days of initial eligibility will be<br/>automatically enrolled in the PPO, Delta Premier, Vision, and Life.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dependents of employees who, pursuant to paragraph c. above, are<br/>defaulted into the designated District group medical plans are not<br/>eligible to be enrolled except as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the next open enrollment period; and/or</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) days of becoming eligible by virtue of such<br/>qualifying events as birth, adoption, marriage or registering of<br/>a California Domestic Partnership.</p>
<p>2. The 2013 District annual maximum contribution toward individual unit<br/>member insurance premiums for District medical plans for full time<br/>employees, employee plus one and family coverage shall be based on the<br/>2013 District PPO rates as adjusted by the cost containment changes. The<br/>District’s annual maximum contribution excludes District dental and vision<br/>insurance.</p>
<p>Beginning the 2014 insurance year (January 1, 2014), and each year<br/>thereafter, the District shall increase the prior year’s District annual<br/>maximum contribution toward individual unit member insurance premiums<br/>for District medical plans for full-time employees, employee plus one and<br/>family coverage by 3.5%. In the event the elected coverage in a District<br/>insurance program exceeds the above stated District maximum annual<br/>contribution, the cost difference shall be paid by the unit member through<br/>payroll deduction. The Health Benefits committee shall actively work to<br/>limit increases greater than 3.5%, through plan design modifications, vendor<br/>selection, wellness programs, and member education. In the event that the<br/>combination of the annual PPO rate increase and/or cost containment results<br/>in premiums below the District maximum annual contribution described<br/>above, that difference will mitigate future rate increases.</p>
<p>VI-4</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest cost District HMO medical plan offered unit members in any<br/>given insurance year shall not be subject to the District annual maximum<br/>contribution described in Section 2 above. In the event that the District<br/>anticipates that the premiums for the lowest cost District medical HMO plan<br/>may exceed the District annual maximum contribution as described in<br/>Section 2 above in the succeeding year, negotiations will automatically be<br/>initiated to address the excess cost during the next round of negotiations.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eligible unit members retiring from the District after August 31, 2013<br/>shall receive the same District annual maximum contribution for District<br/>medical plans provided to active unit members.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall apply any health benefit cost containment changes,<br/>including plan design changes, implemented for active employees to retirees.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Insurance. Employees may choose coverage for themselves and<br/>their eligible dependents or same gender domestic partners for whom a<br/>Declaration of Domestic Partnership is currently on file in the office of the<br/>Secretary of State for the State of California. A choice shall be made from<br/>any one of the approved plans described below during the enrollment period<br/>announced by the Risk Management Branch.</p>
<p>The District agrees to offer employees medical health benefits that include at<br/>least one PPO and two HMO options. Specific providers, plans and plan<br/>designs shall be provided to employees annually prior to open enrollment.<br/>Modifications to providers, plans, and plan designs shall be subject to<br/>recommendations by the Health Benefit Committee (HBC) and shall be<br/>subject to negotiations by the parties.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Insurance Extension. For employees who do not qualify for<br/>benefits as described in Sections C.l. or C.2. above, District-paid health,<br/>dental, vision, and life insurance coverage shall be extended to the end of the<br/>calendar month in which employment is terminated.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental Insurance Extension.

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TUBERCULOSIS EXAMINATION. Required examinations for tuberculosis shall<br/>be provided by the District at no cost to employees only if District-designated service<br/>providers are utilized.

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSULTATION MEETINGS. The Association shall be invited on an annual</p>

<p>VI-9</p>
<p>submitted for consideration to the respective collective bargaining teams for<br/>negotiating. The specific duties of the subcommittee shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actively considering health and benefit cost containment measures relating to<br/>District PPO, HMO, vision and dental insurance plans for recommendation to the<br/>parties. This includes, but is not limited to, co-payments and plan design<br/>modifications, active rate bidding by health care vendors/providers and<br/>alternative plans. It is the intent that the subcommittee shall use every reasonable<br/>effort to maintain the premiums for the lowest cost District HMO medical plan<br/>below the District annual maximum contribution described in Section B.2 above.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership education intended to fully maximize health benefits in a manner<br/>that encourages cost containment and quality health care (e.g., use of emergency<br/>room for non-emergency matters, use of generics, etc.).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ongoing data sharing regarding comparable costs and health plans with similar<br/>districts.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines for meetings consistent with making necessary recommendations for<br/>ongoing negotiations and health benefit renewal dates.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying an additional $800,000 in cost containment and plan changes for<br/>TALB unit members for implementation no later than January 1, 2014. These<br/>cost containment changes will reduce the premiums for the affected plans<br/>beginning January 1, 2014 and are intended to mitigate individual unit member<br/>premium contributions as described in Section B.2.</p>
<p>Committee representation shall be limited to a maximum of four representatives from<br/>each party. The parties shall utilize consultants and/or facilitators as mutually<br/>agreeable. Team members shall agree to joint training on labor-management<br/>facilitation, health benefit design and how to assess benefit plans and look for cost<br/>savings while maintaining quality health care.</p>
<p>Subject to state or federal regulations, the parties agree that all data and<br/>communications regarding health and welfare benefit programs shall be shared<br/>openly between the parties, including discussions regarding bidding and renewals.</p>
<p>VI-10</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII</p>
<p>Leaves of Absence</p>
<p>LEAVES OF ABSENCE (GENERAL):</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All provisions of this Section are controlling for the specific leaves of<br/>absence identified in Sections B. and C. of this Article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for illness or other equally grave emergency as defined in this Article,<br/>a leave of absence will be granted only if it has been determined by the<br/>District that a competent substitute is available.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discretionary leaves of absence, including personal leaves, will not normally<br/>be granted during the first and last week of the employee’s work year, nor<br/>during elementary school parent conference and/or report card periods. In<br/>addition, leaves shall not be granted to employees in middle schools and<br/>senior high schools on the traditional school year calendar during the last<br/>week of the first semester nor during the first week of the second semester.<br/>Exceptions shall be made for approved leaves for illness, grave emergency, or<br/>religious observance.</p>
<p>Any leaves which might be granted during periods described above will be on<br/>a case-by-case basis and will not set precedent in future cases.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approved, leaves of absence without pay for personal business,<br/>vacation or recreation shall be limited to a maximum of five (5) consecutive<br/>workdays.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall determine procedures on employee responsibilities for<br/>application, notification, and verification regarding use of all authorized<br/>leaves of absence. Employees shall be advised of such procedures. The<br/>District shall consult with the Association prior to modification of such<br/>procedures. Upon request, the District shall annually provide to the<br/>Association a copy of all forms, procedures and Board of Education-adopted<br/>policies related to this Article.</p>

<p>VH-l</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII - LEAVES OF ABSENCE (continued)</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee on leave as described in 6.a., for no more than one<br/>school year, who notifies the District in writing by the last duty day<br/>of that school year of his/her intent to return, and who actually returns<br/>to work on the first duty day of the next school year, shall return to the<br/>same site assigned prior to the commencement of leave.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee returning from a leave of absence other than as<br/>described in 6.a. and b., shall be assigned to a position where an<br/>opening exists and within the credential area and division/special<br/>service area assigned previous to the commencement of the leave.<br/>Notification of intent to return to service must be submitted on or<br/>before the first day of March by the employee who plans to return at<br/>the beginning of the first semester of the following school year, or<br/>ninety (90) days before the expiration of the leave if an employee is<br/>returning at another time during the year.

<p>B LEAVES OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY:</p>
<p>1. Leaves of absence without pay may be granted to employees for the</p>
<p>following purposes and when granted shall be governed by the conditions</p>
<p>specified:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Professional and Academic Training. Leave shall be for<br/>no more than twelve (12) consecutive months nor more than one such<br/>leave in a seven (7) year period and this period must be coterminous<br/>with an intersession, a semester, or year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service as a member of the Peace Corps, the Job Corps, or the<br/>Domestic Peace Corps (Volunteers in Service to America). Not more<br/>than twenty-four (24) consecutive months.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching in a Foreign Country. Leave shall be for no more than<br/>twenty-four (24) consecutive months nor more than one such leave in<br/>a seven (7) year period and this period must be coterminous with an<br/>intersession, a semester, or year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel in Foreign Country. Leave shall be granted for a period of<br/>no longer than twelve (12) consecutive months nor more than one<br/>such leave in a seven (7) year period and this period must be<br/>coterminous with an intersession, a semester, or year.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest and Recuperation. Requires doctor's statement. No more than<br/>twenty-four (24) consecutive months.</p>
<p>VII-2</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest and Recreation. No more than twelve (12) consecutive<br/>months.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Care. May be granted to either or both parents only<br/>immediately following maternity leave or adoption plus a period<br/>coterminous with a semester, a school year, or the conclusion of an<br/>intersession, provided the employee notifies Certificated Personnel at<br/>least three weeks prior to the beginning date of the leave. A second<br/>consecutive year of child care leave may be granted upon the request<br/>of the employee. In the event of unforeseen circumstances of a<br/>serious nature related to family need the employee is eligible to apply<br/>for a leave of absence without pay under Section B l n. of this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Service. As provided in the Education Code and the<br/>Military and Veterans Code.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Experience. No more than twelve (12) consecutive months.<br/>The work experience must be directly related to the employee's job<br/>responsibilities.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability Granted to an employee who has been approved by the<br/>State Teachers Retirement System/Public Employees Retirement<br/>System to receive a disability allowance. The period of such leave<br/>will be the term of the disability but not more than thirty-nine (39)<br/>months from the date of approval of the disability allowance.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position Leave. Granted to an employee assigned to serve in a<br/>specially funded program.</p>
<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach in Another School District outside a radius of one hundred<br/>fifty (150) miles from the LBUSD (as measured from the<br/>administration offices). No more than twelve (12) consecutive<br/>months nor more than one such leave in a seven (7) year period.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). As provided for in statute; for<br/>example, to care for him/herself, a child, parent, or spouse with a<br/>serious health condition. Health care provider certification may be<br/>required. See employee notification at work site for additional<br/>information.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons which are deemed sufficient by the Board of<br/>Education.</p>

<p>the following unpaid leaves: rest and recuperation; child care; military</p>
<p>service; disability; family medical leave (if employed at least one complete<br/>year); and in the most extraordinary circumstances, leaves for other reasons<br/>deemed sufficient by the Board of Education.</p>
<p>3. Current STRS/PERS regulations state that employees who are on unpaid<br/>leave of absence do not earn retirement credit. Use of reduced pay or unpaid<br/>leave of absence reduces the employee's STRS/PERS service credit for that<br/>year. STRS/PERS service is credited in proportion to the amount an<br/>employee actually receives in compensation compared to the amount that<br/>employee would have received had he/she been compensated for the full year<br/>(earned divided by the total eamable).</p>
<p>C LEAVES OF ABSENCE WITH PAY:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave. Employees are entitled to leaves of absence, not to<br/>exceed three (3) days (five [5] days if a funeral is attended out of state or<br/>more than two-hundred [200] miles one way is traveled) as a result of the<br/>death of any member of the immediate family. Bereavement leave is non-<br/>cumulative and shall be taken only sequentially and immediately following<br/>the death of a member of the immediate family. No deduction shall be made<br/>from the salary of the employee, nor shall the leave be deducted from leave<br/>granted in other sections of this Article. Members of the immediate family<br/>include mother, step-mother, father, step-father, grandmother, grandfather, or<br/>grandchild of the employee or of the spouse of the employee; and the spouse,<br/>son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, sister,<br/>sister-in-law, of the employee or of the spouse of the employee; or any person<br/>having a principal place of residence in the immediate household of the<br/>employee. Employees who take bereavement leave shall be responsible for<br/>following all notification procedures as per Section A.5. of this Article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imminent Death Leave. Certificated employees under contract are entitled<br/>to two (2) days (non-cumulative) imminent death leave at full pay during<br/>each fiscal year. This type of leave may be authorized in case of accident or<br/>critical illness of a member of the immediate family (as defined in paragraph<br/>1. of this Section) when death of the family member is imminent.</p>
<p>3 Sick Leave:</p>
<p>a. Sick leave entitlement shall be received and deducted in the same<br/>manner. For payroll computation:</p>
<p>.5 day = 4 hours leave</p>
<p>1.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day = 8 hours leave</p>
<p>5.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days = 40 hours leave</p>
<p>10.2 days = 81.60 hours leave</p>
<p>10.5 days = 84.00 hours leave</p>
<p>VII-4</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each school year of service every employee employed five (5)<br/>days a week shall be entitled to the following leave of absence with<br/>full pay for illness or injury:</p>
<p>204-day employees: 10.2 days (81.60 hours)</p>
<p>212-day employees: 10.5 days (84.00 hours)</p>
<p>Sick leave may be deducted in one-half (1/2) hour increments.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee in less than a full-time assignment and/or employed for<br/>less than a full contract year shall receive and have sick leave<br/>deducted in direct proportion to the percentage of the assignment;</p>
<p>e.g., an employee with a fifty (50) percent assignment shall earn or<br/>have deducted .5 (four [4] hours) of sick leave.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) hour of sick leave is granted for each eighteen (18) hours an<br/>employee has worked in an hourly assignment, including summer<br/>school and intersession assignments. Accumulated hourly sick leave<br/>may be used for absences in any hourly assignment, except that<br/>during the first and last week of summer school leave for compelling<br/>personal reasons will not be granted and teachers should expect to be<br/>required to provide doctor's verification of illness absences. Contract<br/>sick leave may not be used for absences in an hourly assignment. If<br/>an employee serving in a contract assignment has exhausted his/her<br/>contract sick leave, accumulated hourly sick leave may be used prior<br/>to statutory sick leave.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who claims sick leave may be required to execute a<br/>certificate or declaration to the effect that he/she was actually ill or<br/>injured on that day(s) before such sick leave may be paid.</p>
<p>Sick leave shall not normally be taken for minor elective or cosmetic<br/>surgery. Exceptions may be approved by the district physician.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the District determines that an employee's health condition may<br/>be impairing job performance. Human Resource Services shall have<br/>authority to direct the employee to have a medical examination by the<br/>district physician, by a District-appointed physician at District<br/>expense, or by an employee-selected physician approved by the<br/>district physician and to be paid by the employee.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a certificated employee under contract does not take the full amount<br/>of sick leave allowed in any school year, the amount not used is<br/>accumulated from year to year, and accrued sick leave is credited<br/>toward time served for retirement purposes.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee's sick leave record is open to the employee's inspection<br/>upon request to the site payroll clerk. Sick leave accumulation shall<br/>be reported on each quadriweekly pay warrant.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member suffering from a catastrophic illness or<br/>injury who has exhausted all accrued sick leave may request sick<br/>leave donations under the Sick Leave Donation Program. A request<br/>to participate is submitted to the employee’s principal/site<br/>administrator. Procedures for both the receipt and distribution of<br/>donated sick leave are provided as part of the Sick Leave Donation<br/>Program, which is Appendix G in this contract.</p>
<p>4. Personal Necessity Leave: (Use of Sick Leave for personal necessity.)</p>
<p>a. Every employee shall be permitted to use not more than seven (7)<br/>days of sick leave per fiscal year for personal necessity (Education<br/>Code. Section 44981) consisting of the reasons listed in (1) through</p>
<p>(8) below.</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving the employee's person or property, or the<br/>person or property of a member of the immediate family, as<br/>defined in Section C.L above. Such accident must a) be<br/>serious in nature, b) involve circumstances the employee<br/>cannot be expected to disregard, and c) require the attention of<br/>the employee during assigned hours of work.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in court as a litigant. (The employee must return<br/>to work in cases in which it is not necessary to be absent more<br/>than half of the regular workday.)</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance as witness under an official order for which salary<br/>is not allowed. Each date of necessary attendance under such<br/>an order, other than the date specified in a subpoena, shall be<br/>certified by the clerk or other authorized officer of the court or<br/>governmental jurisdiction. In any case in which a witness fee<br/>is payable, such fee shall be collected by the employee and<br/>remitted to Financial Services. (The employee must return to<br/>work in cases where it is not necessary to be absent more than<br/>half the regular workday.)</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paternity.</p>
<p>VII-6</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illness in the immediate family of the employee as defined in<br/>Section C.l. above.</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home protection in the event of a natural catastrophe, such as<br/>flood or fire.</p>
<p>(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compelling Personal Reasons. Maximum of five (5) days per<br/>fiscal year upon twenty-four (24) hours prior notice of the<br/>absence to the appropriate manager; for business or other<br/>activity of serious and compelling personal importance that<br/>cannot be conducted before or after the workday. Such<br/>absences will not be approved on days immediately before or<br/>immediately after a District calendared holiday unless the<br/>employee notifies the appropriate manager at least forty-eight<br/>(48) hours in advance and provides the job number and the<br/>name of the person who has been confirmed to substitute for<br/>them.</p>
<p>b. Where possible, and with the exception of (8) above, employees shall<br/>notify the site manager not later than 2:00 p.m. on the day prior to the<br/>workday when leave is to be taken.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutory Sick Leave. If all regular and cumulative sick leave has been<br/>exhausted and a certificated employee under contract continues to be absent<br/>on account of illness or accident, the employee shall be entitled to an<br/>additional period of five (5) school months (one hundred [100] days) per each<br/>illness or accident. Compensation to the employee for each of these one<br/>hundred (100) days shall be at a rate of one-half (1/2) of the employee's daily<br/>rate. An employee shall not be provided more than one (1) five (5) month<br/>period per illness or accident. However, if a school year terminates before<br/>the five (5) month period for the same illness is exhausted, the employee may<br/>take the balance of the five (5) month period during the subsequent school<br/>year. If an employee, having exhausted all available sick leave, continues to<br/>be absent on account of illness or accident beyond the five (5) month period<br/>and the employee is not medically able to resume the duties of his or her<br/>position, the employee, if not placed in another position shall be placed on a<br/>reemployment list for a period of twenty-four (24) months if the employee is<br/>on probationary status or for a period of thirty-nine (39) months if the<br/>employee is on permanent status. The twenty-four (24) month or thirty-<br/>nine (39) month period shall commence at the expiration of the five (5)<br/>month period. When the employee is medically able during the twenty-four<br/>(24) month or thirty-nine (39) month period, the employee shall be returned<br/>to employment in a position for which he or she is credentialed and qualified.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holidays and Student Vacation Periods: A schedule of non-paid holidays<br/>and student vacation periods shall be as set forth in the school calendar.</p>
<p>7 Industrial Injury and Illness Leave:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees who are absent from duty because of<br/>industrial injury or illness and who qualify under the provisions of the<br/>workers' compensation insurance law are allowed, for each injury or<br/>illness, full salary from the first day of absence to and including the<br/>last day of absence for the illness or injury, except that not more than<br/>sixty (60) working days of leave are allowed for any one injury or<br/>illness. Allowable leave under this Section may not be accumulated<br/>from year to year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment on any day during industrial injury or illness, when added to<br/>compensation granted an employee under the workers' compensation<br/>laws of California, shall not exceed the normal wages for the day's<br/>primary assignment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee is still receiving workers' compensation insurance<br/>benefits after entitlement to industrial injury or illness leave is<br/>exhausted, he/she shall be placed on regular sick leave, vacation<br/>leave, or statutory leave.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial injury or illness leave is reduced by one (1) day for each<br/>day of authorized absence, regardless of any compensation paid under<br/>workers' compensation.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is no longer receiving workers' compensation<br/>insurance benefits, but is still unable to return to work as determined<br/>by the district physician, he/she is then placed on regular sick leave or<br/>other leave, as provided by this Agreement.</p>
<p>When the employee goes on one of these types of leave while<br/>receiving workers' compensation insurance benefits, he/she is entitled<br/>to only such payment as will provide full pay for the primary<br/>assignment when added to workers' compensation insurance benefits.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before salary payments are made to an employee absent because of<br/>industrial injury or illness, a report of the illness or injury must be<br/>filed in the office of Risk Management.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After expiration of paid leave, an employee who is unable to return to<br/>work as determined by the district physician may be granted<br/>additional leave without pay for one (1) year. Such leave may be<br/>extended for one (1) additional year for sufficient cause.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periods of leave under this regulation, either paid or unpaid, shall not<br/>be considered to be a break in the service of the employee, except that<br/>days of absence may cause a break in progress toward tenure.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee receiving benefits under the provision of this regulation<br/>may not leave the state of California without the authorization of the<br/>Board of Education.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During all paid leaves of absence the employee must endorse benefit<br/>checks received under state workers' compensation laws to the<br/>District. The District will issue to the employee appropriate warrants<br/>and payments of wages or salary and shall deduct normal retirement<br/>and other authorized deductions. If combined payments under this<br/>regulation total less than the normal full salary, as in the case of an<br/>employee on statutory leave, the employee is not required to endorse<br/>to the District benefit checks received under workers' compensation<br/>laws. For income tax purposes, the District will notify employees of<br/>the amount of disability income paid to the employee for the year.</p>
<p>8. Maternity Leave. A leave of absence for maternity shall be granted</p>
<p>for the period of time that the employee is physically unable to perform<br/>the duties required of her position as certified by her personal physician and<br/>approved by the district physician. Maternity leave is charged to sick leave<br/>balances; if current, accumulated, and statutory sick leave benefits are<br/>exhausted within the period of physical disability, the remaining time<br/>that the employee continues on maternity leave shall be in a leave-without-<br/>pay status. Additional leave without pay may be granted prior to or following<br/>the period of physical disability.</p>
<p>The employee shall notify the appropriate manager of her pregnancy and<br/>furnish a doctor's statement which indicates the estimated date of<br/>confinement and certifies that the employee's condition permits continued<br/>performance of all duties related to her regular assignment. In the event that<br/>the employee appears to be unable to continue to perform all duties related to<br/>her regular assignment at any time prior to the defined period of disability,<br/>the immediate manager may request a review by the district physician of the<br/>period of disability.</p>
<p>The usual period of confinement following the birth of a child is considered<br/>to be six (6) weeks. If the employee's condition varies from the usual in that<br/>she is able to resume performance of all duties related to her regular<br/>assignment at an earlier date (or if it is necessary to extend the leave beyond<br/>six (6) weeks), the employee shall present the appropriate manager with a<br/>statement from her attending physician which describes her condition and the<br/>estimated length of absence. The employee must obtain and furnish<br/>appropriate forms from her physician, and deliver them completed by the</p>
<p>VII-9</p>
<p>physician, to her principal or other manager. At least three (3) weeks prior to<br/>the estimated date of return to active employment, the employee shall notify<br/>the appropriate manager. When the employee is cleared by her personal<br/>physician to return to work, she shall submit the required health form to the<br/>district physician for review.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption of a Child. The District shall grant a leave of absence for the<br/>purpose of adopting a child under the age of six (6) years except in the case of<br/>a special needs child, the age of the child shall not be a consideration.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoption leave is charged to sick leave balances; if current<br/>accumulated, and statutory sick leave benefits are exhausted in the<br/>course of this leave, the remaining time that the employee continues<br/>on leave shall be in a leave-without-pay status.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum length of an adoption leave shall be six (6) weeks in<br/>length.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advance of the adoption, the employee shall notify the appropriate<br/>manager of the anticipated beginning and ending dates of the absence.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the adoption the employee shall provide to the appropriate<br/>manager written verification of significant dates in the adoption<br/>process.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the manager determines the factors related to an employer initiated transfer<br/>necessitated by school, segment, or department enrollment loss, he/she shall ask for<br/>a qualified volunteer. In the event that no one volunteers, the manager shall select<br/>for transfer the temporary contract employee in the school, segment, or department<br/>with the least districtwide seniority. If there are no temporary contract employees in<br/>the school, segment, or department, the manager shall select the probationary<br/>employee who has the least districtwide seniority as a certificated employee.

Such allocation will be used exclusively to provide<br/>additional clerical assistance for school nurses. The distribution of such<br/>assistance will be determined through a process similar to that described in<br/>Section G.5. above.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide nurses with written information concerning automobile and<br/>insurance factors related to their job descriptions.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum class size for Library Service classes in high schools shall be five (5)<br/>students per class period and in middle schools three (3) students per class period,<br/>unless exceptions are mutually agreed upon by the librarian and site manager.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XH</p>
<p>Evaluation Procedure</p>
<p>FREQUENCY. Evaluation and assessment of the performance of employees shall<br/>be made on a continuing basis at least once each school year for temporary and<br/>probationary personnel and at least once every other year for employees with<br/>permanent status.</p>
<p>Effective with the 2008-09 school year, unit members with permanent status shall be<br/>evaluated at least every five (5) years if they have been employed by the district for<br/>ten (10) years or more and if the evaluator and the unit member consent to such time<br/>line. In order to be eligible for the five year cycle a unit member must be deemed to<br/>be “highly qualified” as defined in the No Child Left Behind Act (20 U.S.C. 7801)<br/>and his/her most recent evaluation must contain an overall rating of at least<br/>Satisfactory or Effective. For eligible unit members who do not teach in “core<br/>academic” subjects, qualification requirements shall be the same as for teachers of<br/>“core academic” subjects. For eligible unit members who are not classroom teachers<br/>the District and Association shall review and agree on appropriate comparable<br/>criteria.</p>
<p>Either the evaluator or the unit member may withdraw from this cycle at any time<br/>and such withdrawal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. Upon request<br/>the evaluator will meet with the unit member to explain the reasons for withdrawal.</p>
<p>EVALUATOR. The evaluator shall be the employee's immediate manager and/or<br/>another administrator designated by the manager, by the Superintendent, or by his<br/>designee.</p>
<p>DEADLINES. It is agreed that deadlines specified in this Article, except for the<br/>date of the final evaluation, may be extended by the number of days the evaluatee or<br/>the evaluator is absent from the work site during the identified time periods. Any<br/>change in specified deadlines will be noted in writing by the evaluator along with<br/>reasons for the change in deadline.</p>
<p>NOTIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES. Employees to be evaluated shall receive a<br/>copy of the evaluation procedures within four (4) weeks after the beginning of their<br/>school session work year, traditional or year-round calendar. Those employees will<br/>be advised of the evaluation policy, procedures, standards, and expectations by their<br/>evaluator no later than the end of the fifth school week.</p>
<p>Standardized test norms shall not be used for teacher evaluation. Personnel shall be<br/>judged on the District-adopted evaluation objectives and performance standards.<br/>Such objectives and standards shall be in writing and made available to the evaluatee<br/>prior to any period in which he/she is evaluated.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SETTING OF OBJECTIVES/ACTION PLAN. By the end of the sixth school<br/>week each evaluatee shall be responsible for proposing in writing to the evaluator<br/>specific action plans and standards to be achieved within areas of performance. The<br/>evaluator may propose and/or require additional components in the action plan and<br/>standards for each evaluatee in accordance with the position and assignment.<br/>Employees will be advised if there is to be a specific area(s) of concentration.</p>
<p>Within the maximum of seven (7) weeks of the first working day of an assignment<br/>all action plans and performance standards shall be finalized, reduced to writing, and<br/>signed by the evaluator and evaluatee.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSTRAINTS. When the total length of teaching experience, the length of duty<br/>at one site, the length of time in the assignment, or other factor is considered to be a<br/>constraint by the evaluator or the evaluatee, it may be so noted on the appropriate<br/>form. Employees, who due to the room utilization patterns on a year-round school<br/>schedule are limited in their ability to prepare the classroom prior to the arrival of<br/>students, are deemed to be working within constraints related to room environment<br/>and classroom management for a brief period of time at the beginning of each on-<br/>track assignment.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OBSERVATIONS. Observations shall be both formal and informal. The number<br/>of formal observations shall routinely be three (3). With agreement of both evaluatee<br/>and evaluator the number may be reduced to two (2) or one (1) in cases of obviously<br/>satisfactory performance by permanent employees. Additional observations shall be<br/>conducted when deemed necessary by either the evaluatee or evaluator.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An observation shall be based upon one (1) or more of the following<br/>components: District goals and objectives, individual school/office goals and<br/>action plans, individual employee goals and action plans and performance<br/>assessment criteria.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each formal observation will be followed by a conference which will take<br/>place within five (5) working days.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observations will be summarized on an observation form with a copy<br/>given to the evaluatee within ten (10) working days after the observation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except by mutual agreement, formal observations shall not begin until after<br/>goals and action plans have been agreed upon. In the event that goals and<br/>action plans have not been agreed to, formal observations may begin<br/>following the seventh week of the school year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an unsatisfactory observation lesson analysis, the evaluatee<br/>may request an additional formal observation conducted jointly by the<br/>evaluator and another manager selected by the evaluatee from a list of up to</p>
<p>XII-2</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII - EVALUATION PROCEDURE (continued)</p>
<p>five (5) managers selected by the District. The second manager will be<br/>credentialed/certified in the credential/subject/special services area of the<br/>evaluatee's assignment. The subsequent conference and lesson analysis shall<br/>be conducted/developed by both managers.</p>
<p>H. EVALUATION. An evaluation shall be reduced to writing and transmitted to the<br/>employee no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the last school day for K-12<br/>students as identified on the appropriate traditional or year-round school calendar.<br/>The evaluator will hold a conference to review the written evaluation with the<br/>employee at the time of the transmittal of the written evaluation. The evaluatee shall<br/>sign the evaluation form signifying that he/she has read the form and shall be<br/>provided the opportunity to prepare a written response which shall become a part of<br/>the employee's permanent record. There shall be only one (1) final evaluation form<br/>per year which shall become part of an employee's permanent file. This form may be<br/>supported by documentation deemed appropriate by the site manager.</p>
<p>A joint committee consisting of five (5) unit members appointed by TALB and five</p>
<p>(5) administrators shall be convened to review and revise final evaluation forms and<br/>lesson analysis forms; the final evaluation forms shall conform to and reflect State<br/>Standards and the Lesson Analysis forms shall correlate to the final evaluation forms.<br/>The forms, if amended, shall be submitted to the bargaining teams for final<br/>negotiation. If meetings are scheduled during the work day the unit members shall be<br/>provided released time; if the meetings are scheduled for times after the work day the<br/>unit members shall be paid their regular hourly rate.</p>
<p>I IMPROVEMENT OF LESS THAN EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE. No</p>
<p>assessment of &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; or “developing” shall be introduced on an evaluatee's<br/>evaluation form which has not been first formally called to his/her attention in a<br/>written report. Time shall be allowed, when practicable, from the date of the written<br/>report where the deficiency is first noted and the date of the next evaluation when the<br/>deficiency is formally cited to allow for correction of said deficiencies. Upon<br/>formally citing a condition(s) of less-than-effective performance, the evaluator shall<br/>thereafter confer with the evaluatee and during the conference make specific<br/>recommendations as to areas of improvement in the evaluatee's performance. In the<br/>case of instructional deficiencies, the evaluator will offer direct assistance and/or<br/>additional resources as the evaluator deems appropriate to implement the specific<br/>recommendations.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted as limiting the ability of the District to<br/>take immediate action in the case of an extremely serious or egregious circumstance<br/>as identified in Education Code. Section 44932.</p>
<p>J. PERSONNEL FILE. Each employee shall have the right, by appointment, to<br/>review the contents of his/her personnel file.

A representative of the<br/>Association at the teacher's request may accompany the teacher in this review. Such<br/>review by the employee shall be permitted twice per year before or at the end of the<br/>duty day when instructional duties have been completed.</p>
<p>Negative or derogatory materials will be processed in accordance with Education<br/>Code. Section 44031, which states that information of a derogatory nature shall not<br/>be entered or filed unless and until the employee is given notice and an opportunity<br/>to review and comment thereon. An employee shall have the right to enter, and have<br/>attached to any such derogatory statement, his own comments thereon.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVABILITY. Any grievance arising out of the foregoing procedures shall be<br/>limited to a claim that the procedure has been violated.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARENT/GUARDIAN COMPLAINT. When a parent or guardian complaint<br/>regarding an employee filed pursuant to Education Code.

<p>ARTICLE XIII</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>DEFINITION:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by a grievant that he/she has been adversely<br/>affected by an interpretation, application, or violation of the specific<br/>provisions of this Agreement. Informally, a grievance may be presented<br/>verbally; formally, it shall be presented in writing.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; may be any employee in the bargaining unit covered by the<br/>terms of this contract. The Association may file grievances that relate to the<br/>explicit language contained in Article IV, Association Rights, of this<br/>contract.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day on which the grievant and the appropriate manager as<br/>part of their regular contract assignments are scheduled to be on duty.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate manager&quot; is the lowest level manager who has authority to<br/>remedy the grievance.</p>
<p>INFORMAL LEVEL:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within twenty (20) days after the alleged violation (except for payroll<br/>errors) and before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall<br/>attempt to resolve his/her claim by an informal conference with his/her site<br/>manager. If the employee requests, an Association representative may<br/>participate with the employee in the informal conference. It shall be the<br/>grievant's responsibility to inform the manager that the conference is for the<br/>purpose of seeking to resolve the grievance at the informal level.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate manager shall provide a response within five (5) days of the<br/>informal conference.</p>
<p>FORMAL LEVEL - STEP 1:</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days of the informal conference, should the grievance not be</p>
<p>resolved, the grievant shall present his/her grievance in writing on the District</p>
<p>Certificated Unit Grievance Form to his/her site manager. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1. The statement of the grievance shall be a clear, concise statement of the<br/>circumstances giving rise to the grievance, shall include the specific article,<br/>section, and paragraph of the contract allegedly misapplied, misinterpreted,<br/>or violated, and shall specify the remedy sought.</p>
<p>2. The immediate manager shall communicate the decision to the employee in<br/>writing within ten (10) days after receiving the grievance.</p>
<p>D FORMAL LEVEL - STEP 2:</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the Step 1 response, and if the decision of the manager is not<br/>satisfactory, the grievant, within ten (10) days of receipt of the response may file an<br/>appeal with Employee Relations Services which shall transmit it to the<br/>Superintendent or to another district-level manager designated by the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement of the grievance shall be a clear, concise statement of the<br/>circumstances giving rise to the grievance, shall include the specific article,<br/>section, and paragraph of the contract allegedly misapplied, misinterpreted,<br/>or violated, and shall specify the remedy sought.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant or the respondent (Superintendent or designee) may request a<br/>personal conference regarding the grievance.

<p>E FORMAL LEVEL - STEP 3:</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Step 2, he/she may within ten<br/>(10) days after receipt of the decision at Step 2, submit to Employee Relations<br/>Services a written request for mediation of the grievance. Employee Relations<br/>Services shall within five (5) days after receipt of the written request submit to the<br/>California State Conciliation Service a request for the immediate services of a<br/>mediator.</p>
<p>The parties agree that Step 3 of this Grievance Procedure may be waived by mutual<br/>agreement of the grievant and the District.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the mediator shall be to assist the parties to achieve a<br/>mutually satisfactory resolution of the grievance by means of the mediation<br/>process.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is achieved by means of this<br/>mediation process, both parties to the grievance shall sign a written<br/>statement of resolution to that effect, and thus waive the right of either party<br/>to further appeal the grievance.</p>
<p>F FORMAL LEVEL - STEP 4, BINDING ARBITRATION:</p>
<p>If resolution of the grievance is not achieved as a result of mediation (Step 3) or if<br/>Step 3 has been waived, the grievant may request the Association to submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration.</p><h3>xm-2</h3>
<p>If the Association proceeds to arbitration, the statement of grievance shall be filed<br/>with Employee Relations Services on the appropriate Step 4 form within ten<br/>(10) days following the conclusion of mediation. The form shall include the<br/>same information as cited in D.l. above and the response at Step 2 as well as the<br/>exclusive representative's endorsement of filing.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of Arbitrator:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days of receipt of the Step 4 grievance form,<br/>Employee Relations Services and Association staff shall attempt to<br/>agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator and obtain a<br/>commitment from said arbitrator to serve.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall attempt to agree upon a statement of the issue(s) to<br/>be submitted to arbitration. If the parties cannot agree, the arbitrator<br/>shall determine the issue(s) by referring to the written grievance<br/>documents.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to<br/>present written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit a decision<br/>within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall set forth the<br/>findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issue(s)<br/>submitted. The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make<br/>any decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by<br/>law or which changes or is violative of the terms of this Agreement.<br/>Subject to the limitations specified in Article VI, Section C., it is<br/>agreed that the remedy of the arbitrator may include such financial<br/>reimbursement as may be necessary to make the grievant whole for<br/>any monetary loss resulting from a violation, misapplication, or<br/>misinterpretation of the specific provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>XIII-3</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator shall be submitted to the Association<br/>and the Director of Employee Relations Services, and shall be<br/>binding upon the parties.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such<br/>question will be ruled upon by the arbitrator only after he/she has<br/>had an opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of Exclusion:</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no power to recommend or resolve:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any issue arising out of the exercise by the Board or the<br/>Administration of its responsibilities under Article III, Reserved<br/>Rights of the District, except as modified by specific provisions of<br/>this Agreement.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may request that the hearing be recorded. The costs of<br/>a certified court reporter shall be paid by the party requesting the<br/>reporter and only the party paying for the reporter shall receive a<br/>transcript of the hearing. Alternately, both parties may mutually<br/>agree to share equally the costs of the reporter, in which case both<br/>parties shall receive a copy of the transcript.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant and required employee witnesses will be granted<br/>released time as necessary to participate in any hearing required by<br/>the arbitration process. The release of employee witnesses will be<br/>scheduled to minimize classroom disruption.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party shall bear the expense of the preparation and presentation<br/>of its own case.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expedited Arbitration. The parties may mutually agree that arbitration</p>

The District and the Association recognize the<br/>right of the employee to present grievances without involvement of the<br/>Association and the right of the Association to represent the employee who<br/>so requests it. Both the grievant and the respondent reserve the right to<br/>have representation at each of the steps.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Limits. The District and the Association agree that time limits in this<br/>Article may be extended by mutual consent. If the respondent at any step<br/>fails to meet the deadline for a response, the grievance may be appealed to<br/>the next higher step.

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will have eight (8) members, four (4) appointed by the<br/>Association and four (4) appointed by the District.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will meet during the duty day as needed throughout<br/>the traditional schedule school year. The duration of each meeting<br/>will be dependent upon the number of waiver requests to be<br/>considered. Substitutes will be called through normal procedures.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will be responsible for its own procedures, including<br/>the selection of a chairperson. Requested clerical support will be<br/>provided by the District.</p>

<p>Each year for the duration of this Agreement, the District will commit $300,000 for the<br/>purpose of compensating bilingual and special education teachers for additional<br/>assignments directly related to their area of specialization. To be eligible for this<br/>compensation teachers will:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold either a Bilingual Crosscultural Language and Academic Development<br/>(BCLAD) or Special Education credential; and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a current teaching assignment which requires such credential; and receive<br/>prior site and PALMS/Special Education Office authorization for additional<br/>assignment to accomplish specified tasks beyond their regular workday/work<br/>year.</p>
<p>Additional assignment as described above will be compensated per Schedule P and will be<br/>limited to $1,000 per eligible employee per year.</p>
<p>Department Head - Additional Amount</p>
<p>All department heads will be compensated based upon the teacher periods of instruction<br/>within the department.</p>
<p>PROVISIONS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF SALARY SCHEDULES</p>
<p>A REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO INITIAL PLACEMENT ON SALARY<br/>SCHEDULES:</p>
<p>1. Teaching Experience:</p>
<p>a. As authorized by Education Code. Section 45028, teachers are<br/>allowed credit for previous satisfactory K-12 credentialed teaching<br/>experience up to the maximum step on the appropriate column on<br/>the salary schedule, excluding career increments. For purposes of<br/>this Section, a total school year is defined as a period from the first<br/>day of the professional assignment through the final day of the<br/>regular professional assignment. If a teacher has served under</p>
<p>B-l</p>
<p>contract for fifty (50) percent or more of the total school year or a<br/>full semester; has worked as a substitute teacher for one hundred<br/>thirty-five (135) days in one (1) school year; or has a combined<br/>service of one hundred thirty-five (135) days in one (1) school year<br/>under contract as a substitute or hourly teacher, credit will be given<br/>for one (1) year of experience.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustment for Previous Experience. Official Verification of<br/>satisfactory K-12 credentialed teaching experience must be provided<br/>within the first three years of employment with the District. If an<br/>employee is hired by September 1 of the first year of employment,<br/>verification must be received in Human Resource Services by<br/>November 1 and salary schedule placement adjustment is retroactive<br/>to the beginning of that fiscal year. If verification is received after<br/>November 1, salary schedule placement adjustment will be effective<br/>the following pay period.</p>
<p>If an employee is hired after September 1 of the first year of<br/>employment, verification must be received in Human Resource<br/>Services within sixty (60) days of initial date of employment and<br/>salary placement adjustment is retroactive to the initial date of<br/>employment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Career Increments. An employee who has not previously been<br/>employed by the District in a certificated assignment who has five or<br/>more years of previous teaching experience as defined in this<br/>Appendix will be granted exactly five years of credit toward<br/>attainment of the twenty, twenty-five, and thirty year career<br/>increments. The maximum of five years of credit will be granted<br/>regardless of which step the new employee has attained on the salary<br/>schedule. In addition to the maximum credit, an employee who has<br/>been previously employed by the District and who returns to a<br/>certificated assignment in the District shall be granted credit toward<br/>attainment of career increments only for those years of service<br/>served previously in the employ of the District.</p>
<p>2. Experience Other Than Teaching:</p>
<p>a. In evaluating an applicant’s experience other than teaching, the<br/>District may allow a maximum of four (4) steps on the salary<br/>schedule when this experience will contribute directly to the<br/>effectiveness of the major assignment for which the applicant is<br/>being considered. Two (2) years of experience under this provision<br/>are evaluated as equal to one (1) step on the salary schedule. This<br/>experience cannot be concurrent with credit for teaching experience,<br/>but part-time work experience might be combined with part-time</p>
<p>B-2</p>
<p>teaching. Verification of not less than eleven (11) months of<br/>consecutive work of not less than twenty (20) hours per week may<br/>be computed as the equivalent of one (1) year toward the two-for-<br/>one requirement for work experience credit. In computing work<br/>experience on more than one (1) job, any interruption of service<br/>beyond one (1) month shall break the consecutive requirement,<br/>unless the prospective employee returns to the same position, with<br/>the same employer, within six (6) months without having been<br/>gainfully employed by another employer during that time. Partial<br/>years of credit are not additive.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses and school librarians are given one (1) year of credit for one</p>
<p>(1) year of full-time work experience in a non-school setting as a<br/>nurse or as a librarian up to a maximum of four (4) years per Section<br/>2.a. above.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the current rules for salary schedule placement<br/>purposes, for purposes of initial placement on the salary schedule,<br/>qualified speech/language/pathologists/specialists hired on or after<br/>July 1, 2006 to work in speech and language positions shall be<br/>allowed one step on the salary schedule for each year of verified<br/>work experience as a speech/language/pathologist/specialist in a<br/>non-school setting.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Service. Military Service is credited as prior teaching<br/>experience only if the applicant actually taught while in the service<br/>in the field for which he/she is to be employed.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustment for previous experience official verification of service<br/>described in A.2.b. and A.2.c. of the Appendix must be provided<br/>within the first three years of employment with the District. If an<br/>employee is hired by September 1 of the first year of employment,<br/>verification must be received in Human Resource Services by<br/>November 1 and salary schedule placement adjustment is retroactive<br/>to the beginning of that fiscal year. If verification is received after<br/>November 1, salary schedule placement adjustment will be effective<br/>the following pay period.</p>
<p>If an employee is hired after September 1 of the first year of<br/>employment, verification must be received in Human Resource<br/>Services within sixty (60) days of initial date of employment and<br/>salary placement adjustment is retroactive to the initial date of<br/>employment.</p>
<p>3. Tentative Salary Placement. Applicants who are considered favorably are</p>
<p>asked to sign a statement relative to tentative salary placement that is</p>
<p>B-3</p>
<p>mutually agreeable at the time of employment. Signing the “Tentative<br/>Salary Placement” form indicates that the tentative salary stated thereon is<br/>mutually agreeable.</p>
<p>Additional official, verified salary information presented by November 1 or<br/>sixty (60) calendar days after the initial date of employment which might<br/>indicate a need for change will be considered. If a salary change is<br/>warranted, the adjustment will be retroactive to the first day of paid service<br/>in the school year in which the official, verified information is received.</p>
<p>4. Salary Schedule Placement:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees who are given a contract are placed initially<br/>on the salary schedule in accordance with training completed at an<br/>accredited college or university before the first day of their contract<br/>year. If verification is received after the first day of their contract<br/>year, salary placement adjustment will be effective the following<br/>pay period.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher employed by the Long Beach Unified School District is<br/>placed on a step of the salary schedule in accordance with his/her<br/>experience. A teacher is advanced year by year, until reaching the<br/>maximum step on the schedule, provided he/she is under contract a<br/>sufficient number of days each year and qualifies for advancement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning Teacher Salary Incentive Program.</p>
<p>Since 1999 the District has participated in the Beginning Teacher<br/>Salary Incentive Program. District participation is contingent on the<br/>continuation of special State funding to support this program. As a<br/>result of continuing District participation, K-12 teachers holding a<br/>valid California credential and assigned to specific schedules,<br/>columns, and steps listed below shall be compensated at an annual<br/>rate of pay greater than that provided to new employees who do not<br/>hold a valid California credential.</p>

<p>Human Resource Services in order to advance on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2007, upon receipt of official transcripts on or before</p>
<p>November 1, salary schedule placement adjustment will be granted for</p>
<p>B-7</p>
<p>completed units and/or conferred degrees retroactive to the beginning of the<br/>first duty day of that contract year, for coursework and degrees earned prior<br/>to September 15.

After election to the<br/>District and after the Bachelor’s Degree, exceptions may be made for prior-<br/>approved lower division transfer credit courses and post-baccalaureate<br/>professional courses provided they are related to the present assignment of<br/>the employee. The granting of salary credit to any employee for such<br/>courses will be limited to a maximum of nine (9) semester hours during the<br/>entire time of the employee’s service with the District. Request for<br/>exceptions must be received by Human Resource Services six (6) weeks<br/>prior to the first day of attendance in the course and be approved by the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resource Services, following review by<br/>the Educational Mission: Innovation Advancement Committee (EM:IAC).</p>

Appeals<br/>shall be reviewed by the Educational Mission: Innovation Advancement<br/>Committee (EM:IAC) who shall recommend appropriate action to the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resource Services.</p>
<p>Each university has a transcript key which categorizes courses by the number<br/>series. If the university classifies a course using the term “professional,” but<br/>does not specify it as “professional course for educators,” then the District<br/>will not be able to grant salary credit unless prior District approval is<br/>obtained (as noted in B. 11). Any courses taken prior to employment with the<br/>District shall not qualify for salary schedule placement advancement unless<br/>as otherwise provided in the negotiated agreement.</p>
<p>12. Upper division, graduate level or qualifying professional units will apply<br/>towards salary schedule placement advancement with the submission of<br/>official transcripts. “Qualifying professional units” refers to coursework that</p>

<p>13. Exceptions to the requirement that all course work units must be taken at an<br/>accredited college or university may be made by action of the Educational<br/>Mission: Innovation Advancement Committee (EM:IAC) with the approval<br/>of the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resource Services. This committee<br/>is empowered to grant credit on the salary schedule for successful<br/>completion of in-service courses offered by the Long Beach Unified<br/>School District which (a) involve attendance at sessions equivalent in<br/>time to college or university courses at the same unit value, (b) involve<br/>participation and related work equivalent to that required in college or<br/>university courses of the same unit value, (c) provide needed in-service<br/>opportunities not otherwise readily available, and (d) are found by the<br/>committee to be in the best interest of the instructional program of the<br/>District.</p>

Any exception to this policy requires specific approval<br/>of the Board of Education.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who at the time of resignation was classified as permanent<br/>and who is re-employed under contract within thirty-nine (39) months after<br/>the last day of service, shall be classified as and restored to all rights of a<br/>permanent employee, except as specifically limited by law.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee who has a leave of absence (a) to serve as a<br/>member of the Peace Corps outside the United States, the Domestic Peace<br/>Corps (Volunteers in Service to America), or the Job Corps; (b) to teach in a<br/>foreign country; or (c) to take advanced professional and academic training<br/>is entitled to an increment the same as though he/she had been regularly<br/>employed. To receive such increment, the service or study during the<br/>period of leave must be verified. In order to qualify for the increment<br/>following a leave of absence for advanced professional and academic<br/>training, an employee shall verify that he/she undertook a full load as<br/>defined by the institution attended. A transcript of work taken and grades<br/>earned shall be filed within sixty (60) days of returning to duty. If</p>
<p>B-9</p>
<p>verification is received after sixty (60) days, salary schedule placement<br/>adjustment will be effective the following pay period.</p>
<p>4. A certificated employee who is granted a military leave is entitled to such<br/>increment as would have been received had the employee remained in<br/>active service with the school district.</p>
<p>D ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT BEYOND THE CONTRACT POSITION:</p>
<p>1. Employees in full-time contract positions shall not, during the period of time<br/>covered by the contract, engage in other gainful occupations which impair the<br/>efficiency and character of the school service rendered.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Writing Projects. When an individual is able and willing to<br/>prepare a curriculum guide on one’s own time during off-duty hours, that<br/>person may be elected to receive a lump sum honorarium or extra<br/>compensation for additional duties. Such extra compensation will vary with<br/>the magnitude of the projects.</p>
<p>F OCCASIONAL PROJECTS - IN-SERVICE:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a stipend is paid for participation in an in-service activity, the hourly<br/>rate shall be $30.08.</p>
<p>The only exception to this standard rate will be a specified in-service<br/>participation rate which is mandated by an agency other than the LBUSD as<br/>part of an approved grant or other specially funded program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a stipend is paid for serving as a presenter outside of the workday at<br/>an inservice activity, the rate is currently $47.46 per hour or the regular<br/>hourly rate, whichever is higher. This rate includes documented and pre¬<br/>approved preparation time outside of the workday for the planning of new<br/>presentations. This planning time shall also be paid at the same rate.</p>
<p>B-10</p>
<p>The only exception to this standard rate will be a specified presenter rate<br/>which is mandated by an agency other than the LBUSD as part of an<br/>approved grant or other specially funded program.</p>
<p>The hourly presenter rate will be adjusted by the same percentage as the<br/>average negotiated salary increase.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no obligation to offer a stipend for participation in or presentation<br/>of an in-service activity.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stipend cannot be provided to participants or presenters for an in-service<br/>activity held during the regular duty day as described in Article V, Section<br/>A. of the K-12 Teachers Contract.</p>

<p>G REGULATIONS GOVERNING PAYMENT FOR ADDITIONAL</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENTS:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for extracurricular assignments is based on the level of<br/>responsibility involved and the time commitment the employee must make<br/>to assure the successful participation of students.

In certain sports, post¬<br/>season competition may require the continued participation of students<br/>under the direction/supervision of the band director and/or the drill team<br/>and pepster advisors. Daily rates for employees providing instruction,<br/>direction, and/or coaching during periods of CIF post-season competition<br/>are also provided in Schedule S.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper sponsor shall be paid .10 of the annual stipend listed in<br/>Schedule S per issue not to exceed the total amount of that annual stipend.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a certificated employee accepts an additional compensation<br/>assignment, it is not intended that the assignment should be a bar to<br/>accepting from the school district additional hourly employment. Earnings<br/>from the employment in excess of his/her contract must not be greater than</p>
<p>B-l 1</p>
<p>he/she would have received at the maximum hourly rate for the year at the<br/>maximum number of hours permitted (six [6] hours per week); further, the<br/>additional employment must not interfere with regular contract duties and<br/>must bear the approval of the principal. (School district work on Saturdays<br/>and on vacation days is excluded.)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of compensation is to be made on a quarterly basis during or<br/>subsequent to the period in which the activity is in progress.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of absences for a few days only, the work for which additional<br/>compensation is being paid will await the return of the regular teacher,<br/>except for the middle school playground program. In cases of lengthy<br/>absences, where it becomes necessary for a replacement service employee<br/>to carry on those duties for which additional compensation is allowed, the<br/>replacement service employee shall be paid an amount which bears the<br/>same ratio to the total amount allowed for the activity as the number of<br/>school days the replacement service employee worked bears to the total<br/>number of days listed to do the job.</p>
<p>The following formula shall be used in computing the pay for a replacement<br/>service employee who has performed those duties for which the regular<br/>teacher would have received additional compensation:</p>
<p>Number of days worked as a replacement service employee</p>
<p>divided by</p>
<p>Number of additional assignment days for which regular employee is compensated</p>
<p>multiplied by</p>
<p>Total compensation for the specific additional assignment</p>
<p>equals</p>
<p>Pay for this assignment to replacement service employee</p>
<p>Whenever the replacement service employee has earned this additional pay,<br/>it shall be included in the monthly payroll, rather than being allowed to<br/>accumulate. At the end of each activity, the amount paid the substitute shall<br/>be deducted from the amount set up for that activity.</p>

<p>Paperwork, Reporting Student Data, and Utilization of Technology</p>
<p>The Long Beach Unified School District and the Teachers Association of Long Beach<br/>agree to address the Association’s issues pertaining to paperwork, reporting student data,<br/>and utilizing technology in a collegial and collaborative manner. Both the District and<br/>Association agree that the “Elementary Committee for Paperwork Management” be<br/>charged with the responsibility of formulating responses to these issues and developing/<br/>implementing appropriate interventions and procedures.</p>
<p>The Teachers Association of Long Beach and the District shall jointly review the success<br/>of the interventions and procedures on an annual basis and make recommendations for<br/>refinement of same, as needed, to the Superintendent and TALB Executive Director.</p>

<p>Sick Leave Donation Program</p>
<p>The District and the Teachers Association of Long Beach agree to the implementation of the<br/>following Sick Leave Donation Program. This program shall be available to all members of<br/>the bargaining unit. The District and the Association further agree to review and evaluate the<br/>effectiveness of this plan after a full year has elapsed following the ratification of this contract<br/>by both the Association and the Board of Education. The purpose of the Sick Leave Donation<br/>Program is to provide assistance to bargaining unit members suffering from a catastrophic<br/>physical illness or injury. The Sick Leave Donation Program provides employees with an<br/>opportunity to be restored to health so they can return to work.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>As used herein the following definitions are agreed to in reference to the Sick Leave Donation<br/>Program.</p>
<p>Work Day: A work day, for the purposes of this Article, is a day when designated<br/>parties to the approval process are at work for all or part of the day.</p>
<p>Donation Day: A donation day is defined as eight (8) hours for all employees.</p>
<p>Pay: Pay is defined as the employee’s regular daily rate excluding compensation for<br/>additional hourly assignments.</p>
<p>Sick Leave: Sick leave available for donation is defined as the employee’s accrued<br/>monthly sick leave pursuant to Article VII of the Agreement. Accrued hourly sick<br/>leave is excluded from any donations to the program.</p>
<p>Extended Sick Leave: These are additional days of sick leave which have been<br/>donated by other District employees, both bargaining unit members and employees<br/>who are not members of the bargaining unit, from their own accrued monthly sick<br/>leave balances. These days of additional leave may be used to extend the recipient’s<br/>sick leave and this leave may be taken on either consecutive or non-consecutive dates.<br/>The extended absence of the recipient must be due to the same illness or injury,<br/>conforming to the requirements for use of statutory sick leave. Illness or injury which<br/>qualifies as Workers’ Compensation Leave is excluded from this program.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Illness or Injury: Catastrophic illness or injury is defined as an illness or<br/>injury that has been concisely identified as such by the treating physician; the medical<br/>prognosis is the employee will be incapacitated for an extended period of time; and the<br/>employee’s absence exceeds the individual’s accrued paid leave.</p>
<p>F-l</p>
<p>Eligibility Requirements for Leave Recipients;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member is eligible for extended sick leave if</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he/she has exhausted all of his/her accrued paid leave, which includes but is<br/>not limited to sick leave;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he/she is suffering from a catastrophic illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate him/her for an extended period of time;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the incapacity suffered by the employee requires him/her to take time off from<br/>work beyond the number of days covered by the employee’s accrued paid<br/>leave, and a financial hardship would result for the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of days which a recipient may receive for the same illness shall<br/>be no more than the total number of duty days in the employee’s work year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave accrued by the recipient during the time he/she is on extended sick leave<br/>shall be credited against the employee’s days of absence. These days are in addition<br/>to the maximum number of days of extended sick leave which the recipient is entitled<br/>to receive.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members receiving remuneration under worker’s compensation provisions shall<br/>not be eligible to draw extended sick leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who may be eligible for disability payments under the State Teachers<br/>Retirement System (STRS) or the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) shall<br/>apply for benefits at the earliest opportunity. Upon approval for receipt of STRS or<br/>PERS disability payments, the unit member’s eligibility to continue to draw extended<br/>sick leave shall cease.</p>
<p>Guidelines for Donor Participants:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the bargaining unit who has available monthly sick leave balances<br/>may donate to an employee who is in need of extended sick leave. The required<br/>minimum donation shall be one day (eight hours).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are not members of the bargaining unit may also donate to the<br/>employee who is in need of extended sick leave, but under the provisions of this</p>
<p>program, employees who are not members of the bargaining unit will not be eligible to<br/>draw such leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee wishes to contribute more than one day, he/she may donate up to a total<br/>of five (5) days per year to a specific employee who has been authorized for extended</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring receiving employees’ extended sick leave balance to ensure that<br/>donated leave transferred does not exceed the total number of days in the<br/>receiving employees’ regular work year.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notifying payroll clerks and employees at those work sites/schools to which<br/>donors are assigned that donations have occurred and that donor employee sick<br/>leave balances need to be adjusted accordingly on records at the work<br/>site/school.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notifying the payroll clerk at the work site/school to which the receiving<br/>employee is assigned that the employee has received an initial extended sick<br/>leave increment of up to forty (40) days. In the event that additional<br/>increments are provided, a similar notification shall be communicated to the<br/>payroll clerk.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated sick leave days will be distributed to the recipient by the Payroll Department<br/>in increments of 40 days (320 hours) assuming that the number of days donated total<br/>forty (40) or more. If less, the final increment shall reflect the balance of those days<br/>donated.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the requesting recipient exhausts all paid sick leave before final approval is secured<br/>and is placed on statutory leave before the sick leave donation is approved, statutory<br/>leave charged to the employee shall be restored upon determination of approval and</p>
<p>days previously charged to statutory leave shall be charged to the sick leave donation</p>
<p>program.</p>
<p>F-4</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the total number of days which are donated to a specific employee is not used by<br/>that employee, the balance of unused days shall be transferred to a designated sick<br/>leave depository. Depository records will be maintained by the Director of Payroll,<br/>and these records shall be available for review by TALB upon request. Days carried<br/>over will be available to recipients whose requests are approved at a later date.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipt of extended sick leave benefits under this program shall delay the beginning of<br/>the period of eligibility for statutory leave. The employee will become eligible for<br/>statutory leave after all extended sick leave has been exhausted.</p>

<p>APPENDIX G - DISTRICT INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC MAIL GUIDELINES<br/>AND PROCEDURES (continued)</p>
<p>• Posting chain letters or engaging in “spamming” - i.e., sending an annoying or<br/>otherwise unnecessary message to a large number of people</p>
<p>The network is provided for represented certificated staff to conduct research, to<br/>communicate with others on academic topics, and to engage in legitimate District business.<br/>Individual users of the District computer networks are responsible for their behavior and<br/>communications on those networks. Users shall comply with District standards and will<br/>abide by the policies specified herein. Violations of the District policy described may<br/>result in access privileges being suspended or revoked, as well as other disciplinary action<br/>as warranted. Any commercial, political, or unauthorized use of those materials or<br/>services, in any form, is forbidden. All copyright laws must be observed.</p>
<p>Members of the certificated teachers bargaining unit may engage in teacher association<br/>business on the District computer networks. Such teacher association business shall be<br/>conducted during non-duty hours which are defined in Article IV, Section C of this<br/>Agreement. Association use of District e-mails shall be limited to the following:<br/>authorized Association representatives may use District e-mails to provide notice of<br/>meetings, agendas for meetings, minutes of meetings, confirmation of a meeting with a<br/>District representative, or a limited distribution communique' between an authorized<br/>Chapter officer and a District representative; the Association will not use e-mail to<br/>denigrate the District or its personnel and will observe the prohibitions of Education Code,<br/>Section 7054.</p>
<p>The Long Beach Unified School District respects the privacy of all certificated teacher<br/>users. System administrators and their staff may not log on to a user’s account or view a<br/>user’s files without explicit permission from the user (for example, by setting file access<br/>privileges). Exceptions arise when the user’s account is suspected either of disrupting or<br/>endangering the security or integrity of any network systems or services or of violations of<br/>applicable school district policies, federal or state law. Even then, the system<br/>administrator must normally obtain prior approval of the Director of Information Services<br/>unless grave danger to the continued operation of the systems requires emergency action.</p>
<p>This does not preclude system administrators from maintaining and monitoring system<br/>logs of user activity from within the District firewall on school district property.<br/>Moreover, automated searches for files that endanger system security or integrity are<br/>preformed regularly to protect all users. System administrators may take appropriate<br/>action in response to detection of such files (typically removal of those files and possibly<br/>suspension of the user’s accounts until the matter can be resolved).</p>
<p>Use of the computer network may be revoked at any time for inappropriate use. The<br/>Technology and Information Services Branch, in collaboration with school administration,<br/>will be the sole determiners of what constitutes inappropriate behavior according to local,<br/>state, and federal law. The violation of any item contained in this policy may result in the<br/>loss of computer access and/or other disciplinary action, as well as possible punitive action<br/>as provided for by local, state, and federal law.</p>

<p>APPENDIX G - DISTRICT INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC MAIL GUIDELINES<br/>AND PROCEDURES (continued)</p>
<p>Security on any computer system is a high priority, especially any system that has many<br/>users and/or Internet access. Represented certificated staff members shall not let others use<br/>his or her account or password as he or she has a reasonable responsibility for all actions<br/>related to his or her account. Certificated staff must notify school administrators<br/>immediately if their password is lost or stolen or if they think someone has access to their<br/>account. Represented certificated employees are to use only the network directories and<br/>resources that have been assigned for their use. Unauthorized access to any other level of<br/>the system, or other system resource, is strictly prohibited. Users will make no attempt to<br/>bypass the District anti-virus software, firewall, filtering and safeguards. When finished<br/>with a computer represented certificated employees are expected to logout where<br/>appropriate.</p>
<p>Represented certificated employees are not allowed to install software onto the computers<br/>or the computer network without a valid purchase order or other proof of District or<br/>personal ownership. Legal software and/or data stored on local hard drives of District<br/>computers are subject to removal with prior notification and consent of the represented<br/>certificated staff member. Long Beach Unified School District shall take reasonable<br/>precautions to ensure the security, integrity, or longevity of data and/or programs stored on<br/>staff computers.</p>
<p>Represented certificated staff acknowledge that they share responsibility for any and all<br/>use of the District’s computer network and that misuse could lead to liability and/or<br/>consequences that extend beyond the District’s authority. The Long Beach Unified School<br/>District and its represented certificated staff members shall be held harmless from any use<br/>or misuse of the computer network by students. Long Beach Unified School District<br/>makes no warranty of any kind, whether expressed or implied, for the service that it is<br/>providing. Long Beach Unified School District will not be responsible for any damage<br/>users may suffer including, but not limited to, loss of data or interruptions of service as a<br/>consequence of equipment failure, either on or off District property. Long Beach Unified<br/>School District and its represented certificated employees are not responsible for the<br/>accuracy or quality of the information obtained through or stored on the system.</p>

<p>APPENDIX H</p>
<p>Shared Decision Making</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may apply for available grade level, teacher council<br/>representative, department head, or SLC lead teacher positions at their school<br/>site. Openings and the requirements of the positions will be posted by the site<br/>administrator on the designated staff bulletin board and emailed to all school<br/>faculty. To qualify for consideration, applicants must have received at least a<br/>satisfactory or effective rating in their most recent evaluation and meet the job<br/>description requirements.</p>
<p>The site administrator will identify the three top qualified candidates for each<br/>posted position based on the posting requirements. Thereafter, an election will<br/>be conducted at the site by unit members to determine which candidate will be<br/>selected. Selection will be based on a majority vote by affected bargaining unit<br/>members for a one-year term.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A joint Shared Decision Making Committee (SDMC) will be established during<br/>the 2013-2014 school year to collect evidence of current practices of site<br/>decision making and leadership teams from all school sites, and other external<br/>practices, to develop recommendations for the establishment of a best practice<br/>prototype. The prototype would be flexible enough to comport with current<br/>models that are working successfully but have different approaches in<br/>implementation. The Committee will be comprised of five (5) TALB-<br/>appointed members and five (5) District-appointed members. The<br/>recommendation of the Committee shall be submitted to the District and TALB<br/>on or before March 28, 2014.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A joint District-TALB Common Core Committee will collaborate on District<br/>and school-site issues relating to the implementation of the Common Core State<br/>Standards (CCSS), including providing recommendations on the expenditure of<br/>CCSS Implementation Funds, consistent with the District-adopted general plan<br/>for CCSS implementation.</p>
<p>The committee will include six (6) TALB-appointed members and six (6)<br/>District-appointed members. Meetings will occur as needed during the<br/>workday unless otherwise determined by the committee. Each party will<br/>appoint one member to jointly work on creating the agenda for committee<br/>meetings.</p>
<p>CCSS Implementation Fund spending decisions at the school site level will be<br/>made by the site administrator in collaboration with an existing site leadership<br/>team and an elected TALB site representative.</p>
