<p>3.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Rights</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize the right of employees to form, join and participate in lawful<br/>activities of employee organizations and the equal alternative right of employees to refuse to form, join and<br/>participate in employee organizations. Neither party shall discriminate against an employee in the exercise<br/>of these alternative rights.</p>
<p>3.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, membership in the Association shall not be compulsory. A unit member has the right to choose,<br/>either: to become a member of the Association; or, to pay to the Association a fee for representation<br/>services; or, to refrain from either of the above courses of action upon the grounds set forth in Section 3.8.6<br/>below.</p>
<p>3.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members' Obligation to Exclusive Representation</p>
<p>A bargaining unit member who does not fall within one of the exempted categories as set forth in Section</p>
<p>3.8.6 below, and who has not voluntarily made application for membership in the Association within the<br/>sixtieth (60<sup>th</sup>) day following the date upon which said employee has been formally hired by the District as<br/>a bargaining unit employee, must as a condition of employment in the District pay annually to the<br/>Association a representation fee, in exchange for representation services necessarily performed by the<br/>Association in conformance with its legally imposed duty of fair representation on behalf of said unit<br/>member who is not a member of the Association. The District shall provide the Association upon request<br/>a current list of the names of all bargaining unit personnel.</p>
<p>3.8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of Representation Fee</p>
<p>The Representation Fee collected from non-Association unit members pursuant to Section 3.8.3 above shall<br/>not exceed an amount equal to the Association's (RBTA/SBU77CTA/NEA) annual dues for representing such<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>3.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prorated Representation Fee</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members hired during the school year shall pay a prorated representation fee. Such pro<br/>rata share shall be based upon the number of days of actual scheduled service for a school year as<br/>compared with the number of days available for full-time employment in the school year. Any fraction of<br/>a month shall be counted as a full month. Part-time, non-exempt bargaining unit members shall pay a<br/>prorated representation fee on the basis of said employee’s annual salary as compared with the same<br/>annual salary for a comparable full-time employee. Upon request the District shall provide the<br/>Association with the names of all bargaining unit personnel hired after September 30 of each school<br/>year.</p>
<p>3.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees Exempted From Obligation To Pay Association</p>
<p>No unit member shall be required to join the Association or to make an agency fee payment if the unit<br/>member is an actual verified member of a bonafide religion, body or sect which has historically held<br/>conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>3.8.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such exempt unit member shall, as an alternative to payment of such<br/>representation fee to the Association, pay an amount equivalent to such representation fee to<br/>the Redondo Beach Education Foundation or a charity mutually agreed upon by the Association<br/>and the exempt unit member.</p>
<p>3.8.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, upon written request, may require such exempt unit member<br/>to submit a written affidavit to the Association verifying the existence and nature of the allowable<br/>objection to payment of a representation fee. In addition, the Association may require such<br/>exempt unit member to submit proof of payment of an amount equivalent to such representation<br/>fee to one of the alternative funds or organizations referenced above.</p>
<p>3.8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Method</p>
<p>Any unit members who are not exempted from payment under Section 3.8.6 above may pay annually the<br/>properly determined representation fee directly to the Association.</p>
<p>3.8.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative to the direct payment method, a unit member may voluntarily sign and deliver to<br/>the District a written assignment authorizing deduction of the properly established representation fee<br/>as defined in Section 3.8.4 above, subject to the conditions set forth elsewhere in this agreement for<br/>payroll deductions. Upon voluntary authorization duly completed and executed, the District will<br/>deduct from the pay of unit members and pay to the Association the normal and regular monthly<br/>representation fee.</p>
<p>3.8.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member who is not exempted from payment under Section 3.8.6 does not<br/>voluntarily sign and deliver to the District an authorization pursuant to Section 3.8.3 or pay annually<br/>the representation fee directly to the Association pursuant to Section 3.8.7, the Association may<br/>request in writing that the District deduct from the pay of the unit member and pay to the Association<br/>the normal and regular monthly representation fee without the approval of the unit member. Prior to<br/>making a request for the District to involuntarily deduct the representation fee from any unit<br/>member's pay, the Association shall notify the unit member of the request If the unit member and<br/>the Association are unable to reach agreement on the manner of payment the District shall be<br/>obligated to make such deductions as requested by the Association.</p>
<p>3.8.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is under no obligation to make payroll deductions for periods during which a unit member is<br/>either terminated from active employment or not on the District's active payroll for any reason, including, but<br/>not limited to, layoff and voluntary leave of absence for more than thirty (30) days. Upon rehiring of any unit<br/>member, or upon the recalling of a unit member from layoff status, the District will resume or initiate dues or<br/>representation fee deductions for such member only upon a valid dues/representation fee deduction<br/>authorization as defined herein.</p>
<p>3.8.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obligations of Parties</p>
<p>3.8.9.1 District's Obligations</p>
<p>The District's sole and exclusive obligations under this Article are to notify any unit member who has<br/>failed to comply with the provisions of this Section that, as a condition of employment with the<br/>District, such unit member must either become an Association member, pay a representation fee,<br/>either through voluntary or involuntary deductions, or establish an exempt status and make payment<br/>pursuant to provisions of Section 3.8.6 of this Agreement, and to make payroll deductions pursuant<br/>to Section 3.8.7.1 of this Agreement. It is the express intention of the parties that the agency fee<br/>obligation outlined herein constitutes a condition of continued employment and that the parties<br/>contemplate utilizing the remedies provided for in Education code Section 45061 for enforcing this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>3.8.9.2 Association Obligations</p>
<p>The Association shall be responsible for requiring unit members to fulfill obligations defined herein<br/>and to collect any representation fees which may be due and payable to the Association in<br/>consideration for its services as the exclusive representative of unit employees.</p>
<p>3.8.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold Harmless Provision</p>
<p>The Association and/or its parent organization, CTA, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless from liability and<br/>pay all legal fees and legal costs incurred in defending against any court action and/or administrative action<br/>before the Public Employment Relations Board challenging the legality or constitutionality of the agency fee<br/>provisions of this agreement or their implementation; and shall have the exclusive right to decide<br/>representation and to determine whether any such action or proceeding referred to in the above paragraph<br/>shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, tried or appealed.</p>
<p>3.8.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not deduct money specifically earmarked for ABC, PAC, or other political activities unless<br/>such deduction is affirmatively, separately and specifically authorized in writing by the unit member.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4-HOURS</p>
<p>4.1 Unit members' regularly assigned on-site duty hours shall be as follows:</p>
<p>K-5 (or 6<sup>th</sup> grade where part of a K-6 school) 8:00 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.</p>
<p>6-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7:40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3:03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.m.</p>
<p>or equivalent on-site duty hours. The term &quot;equivalent on-site duty hours&quot; is limited to accommodating the district's<br/>exclusive discretion to schedule the beginning and ending of the instructional day at other times depending upon the<br/>needs or practices at an individual school site, provided that the district shall not alter the above starting and ending<br/>times by more than one-half hour each. Unit members are encouraged to remain for a sufficient period after the close<br/>of their assignment to attend to those matters, which properly require attention at the time.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, individual school sites may establish variable schedules subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such schedules must provide the annual instructional minutes required to meet SB813 longer day/longer<br/>year requirements;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule must be approved by a majority of the faculty at the school site and by the site administrator;</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule must be presented with rationale in support of the variation. The affected site representative(s)<br/>shall be provided an additional copy of the proposed schedule for forwarding to the RBTA office.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the schedule is subject to final approval by district level administration, i.e., Superintendent<br/>or his/her designee;</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval is valid for only one school year at a time;</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the challenges of both the Common Core Standards implementation and the integration<br/>of a broad range of emerging technologies into the classroom through Measure Q funds, RBTA and<br/>RBUSD have agreed to collaborate in the creation of a flexible, multi-faceted approach to professional<br/>development that honors the particular circumstances of individual schools, departments, grade levels<br/>and teachers.</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2013-2014 school year:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not more than a total of eight days of the regularly scheduled early release days may be used<br/>for the purpose of engaging in activities focused on whole school and/or grade-level professional<br/>development at the elementary school level. Such activities will be developed and implemented<br/>by the site principal in consultation with school-site leadership teams elected pursuant to 3.1.6.3.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not more than a total of 50% of regularly scheduled early release days may be used for the<br/>purpose of engaging in activities focused on whole school, department and/or grade-level<br/>professional development at the middle school level.

If an IEP needs to be rescheduled, it shall not be the<br/>responsibility of the unit member to reschedule the meeting. <sup>12</sup></p>
<p>12</p>
<p>4.4.3. Fall parent/teacher conferences are mandatory. Spring parent/teacher conferences shall be<br/>scheduled at the discretion of the teacher unless the student is in danger of receiving a “D” or “F”, or its<br/>equivalent in elementary school, or if a parent requests such a conference.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 6 ■ CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will commit to maintaining average class size at each elementary school site in grades K (inclusive of TK)<br/>through 3 at 24, but in no case shall the average class size in grade K (inclusive of TK) through 3 at each elementary<br/>school exceed 26 while the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) class-size guidelines remain in effect. Should the<br/>LCFF class-size guideline change, this section shall be rendered null and void.</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other average class sizes will be maintained at no greater than 30. Additionally, the District recognizes its<br/>obligation not to exceed enrollment of 35 (except for such traditional large group classes for which a stipend is<br/>paid; e.g. ASB, band, orchestra, yearbook, journalism, visual and performing arts, vocal music, etc.) for a period<br/>of three consecutive weeks following the start of each semester/trimester or seven consecutive working days<br/>during the school year. For the purposes of this Article, teaching assistants assigned to sections shall not be<br/>included in the calculation of class size. The class size maximum for physical education classes (excluding<br/>athletic teams) shall be 50. The District also affirms that the adherence to these limits is both desirable and<br/>preferable. Recognizing that circumstances beyond the District’s control can result in the enrollment of students<br/>that cause the enrollment of a given class to exceed these limits and terms; after consulting with the department<br/>chair or an RBTA Executive Board member, the District will adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
<p>6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the enrollment of student(s) results in an abrogation of the class size limit, but is not sufficient to reorganize<br/>classes in order to open an additional class or section of at least twenty students, the receiving teacher will be<br/>compensated accordingly:</p>
<p>Teachers of Grades 6-12</p>
<p>One student over the maximum: $400 per semester<br/>Two students over the maximum: $1000 per semester<br/>Three students over the maximum: $1800 per semester<br/>Four students over the maximum: $2800 per semester</p>
<p>Teachers of Grades K-5</p>
<p>One student over the maximum: $400 per trimester<br/>Two students over the maximum: $1000 per trimester<br/>Three students over the maximum: $1800 per trimester<br/>Four students over the maximum: $2800 per trimester</p>
<p>6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no breaching of the class size limits by more than four (4) students per class or section.</p>
<p>6.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where more than one class exists within a school that can accommodate the needs of the enrolling student, the<br/>principal shall consult with each teacher qualified to accept the student to gain the acceptance and consent of the<br/>teacher prior to enrolling the student.</p>
<p>6.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where only one class exists within a school that can accommodate the needs of the enrolling students (for<br/>reasons such as program offering, qualifications, specialized training/authorization, etc.) and which thereby<br/>prevents the opening of an additional class or section, the receiving teacher shall receive an additional $50 per<br/>student, per semester or trimester. All compensation shall be prorated according to the percentage of days per<br/>semester/trimester that a student is enrolled on the teacher’s roster.</p>
<p>6.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make every effort to place students with lEP’s and/or 504 plans proportionally among general<br/>education teachers. Unit members with a disproportionate number of students on lEP’s and/or 504 plans as<br/>compared to the other teachers in the same grade level or department at their site shall be provided relief through</p>
<p>measures such as, but not limited to, being assigned a classroom aide, reduced class size, reduced number of<br/>subject preparations at the secondary level, etc.</p>
<p>6.1.7 District shall endeavor to maintain all elementary class sizes as closely as possible to the grade-level average at<br/>each school site.</p>
<p>6.2 The computations in 6.1 do not include Special Education, SCROC, Chapter 1 or Class Size Reduction and any<br/>certificated staff member not assigned to a class. <sup>18</sup></p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pertinent Factors</p>
<p>The District and the Association acknowledge that external conditions can affect a unit member's<br/>performance and his/her ability to meet objectives.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rating Scale</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meets District Expectations</p>
<p>Performance meets established standards. Teaching practices fully meet all performance expectations at an<br/>acceptable level. Teacher maintains an adequate scope of competencies and performs additional<br/>responsibilities as assigned.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs Improvement</p>
<p>Performance requires improvement to meet minimum performance expectations.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>Performance is consistently inadequate/unacceptable. Teaching practices require considerable<br/>improvement to meet minimum performance standards. Rating at this level requires participation in the PAR<br/>Program (applies to classroom teachers only).</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information</p>
<p>Evaluation and assessment of the performance of each certificated employee shall be made on a continuing<br/>basis, at least four times each school year for temporary or probationary personnel, and at least once every other<br/>year for personnel with permanent status except as provided for in 9.3.1. The evaluation shall include<br/>recommendations, if necessary, as to areas of improvement in the performance of the employee. In the event a<br/>permanent employee is not performing his/her duties in a satisfactory manner, the District shall notify the<br/>employee in writing of such fact and describe such unsatisfactory performance no later than February 1st.

Teacher evaluation will be based on the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession. Three standards will be chosen for primary focus, two chosen by the teacher and<br/>one chosen by the evaluator. Teachers will identify one key element from each of the three<br/>standards selected and will develop a specific goal for each of the three standards. All six of the<br/>standards will be considered in the overall performance rating for temporary and probationary<br/>teachers. The overall performance rating for permanent teachers will be based on the three<br/>standards chosen for primary focus. During the course of the evaluation period, circumstances<br/>may arise which require modification of the evaluation elements. The parties will make every<br/>effort to arrive at such revisions jointly. If they cannot do so, the elements shall be determined by<br/>the evaluator.</p>
<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations</p>
<p>9.4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every temporary or probationary member of the unit shall be observed at least four (4) times during<br/>the school year, with the first taking place no later than November 15 and the fourth taking place no<br/>later than March 1.

<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints Regarding Unit Members (Moved to Article 14)</p>
<p>9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative Evaluation Process</p>
<p>9.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative evaluation process is designed to increase opportunities for professional growth available<br/>to the District’s permanent certificated staff. It serves as an alternative to the traditional performance<br/>evaluation process to encourage accomplished teachers and staff to continue their professional<br/>development and personal growth. This evaluation process provides flexibility, permitting teachers and<br/>staff to grow in self-chosen areas of interest</p>
<p>9.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants will be permanent unit members who have consistently demonstrated competence in<br/>previous evaluations, and who wish to engage in a personalized program of professional growth. There<br/>will be no limitation on the number of participants at each site. The principal and unit member may<br/>determine a mutually agreeable alternative evaluation option.</p>
<p>9.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating unit members will set meaningful goals that will serve as a focus for their professional<br/>growth, and establish suitable criteria for the evaluation of that growth.</p>
<p>9.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a conference held prior to the end of the sixth week of school, the unit member and the administrator<br/>will agree on these goals, the evaluation option, and the criteria for evaluation.</p>
<p>9.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Guidelines</p>
<p>Unit members and administrators are encouraged to be creative in developing new or innovative options for<br/>use as evaluative tools. A wide variety of evaluation designs are possible. Some possible options are:</p>
<p>9.7.5.1 Portfolio: A portfolio serves as a compilation of materials selected by the teacher to create a</p>
<p>record of actions taken and progress made in meeting his/her goals. Sample inclusions may be<br/>a log of activities, samples of student work, examples of newly developed curriculum,</p>
<p>photographs, video tapes, and/or student evaluations of activities related to the teacher’s<br/>professional growth goals.</p>
<p>9.7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflective Journal: A journal may serve as a mirror for a teacher’s experience in the classroom.<br/>The act of written reflection upon one’s teaching can focus efforts to refine teaching skills and<br/>lead to solutions for specific instructional challenges.</p>
<p>9.7.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive Coaching: The purpose of a coach is to provide effective feedback on the unit<br/>member’s progress toward professional growth goals through a series of meetings which may<br/>include pre-observation conferences, classroom observation, and discussion. The unit member<br/>with the approval of the administrator selects the peer coach.</p>
<p>9.7.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Action Research: The teacher will select and identify a specific concept, instructional<br/>strategy, or theoretical approach to be studied in the classroom. The action research will involve<br/>an in-depth study of the effects of implementing a particular practice in the classroom. This<br/>research may be accomplished in conjunction with graduate course work or a mentor project.</p>
<p>9.7.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative Groups: Participants will meet for regular structured interactions. The groups may<br/>focus on a particular educational growth area or curricular program. The groups will meet at<br/>scheduled times not only to discuss each member’s personal goals, but also to discuss the<br/>commonalties in the instruction.</p>
<p>9.7.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Research: The unit member will select a topic to research that is related to an<br/>instructional/curricular growth priority that may be implemented within the classroom.</p>
<p>9.7.6 Assessment of Outcomes</p>
<p>9.7.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the planning process the unit member and administrator will determine the monitoring<br/>schedule. At least thirty days prior to the end of the school year, the unit member and<br/>administrator will meet to review the unit member’s progress. A written summary of the<br/>alternative plan and results shall be placed in the unit member’s personnel file along with an<br/>assessment by the administrator.</p>
<p>9.7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the alternative evaluation plan proves to be impractical, it may be discontinued<br/>by mutual consent of the unit member and administrator. The unit member’s evaluation will<br/>revert to the standard district practice. <sup>27</sup></p>

If the illness or injury exceeds three (3) consecutive days,<br/>the District may require, at District's expense a certified medical specialist to examine the unit member and<br/>make all necessary inquiries in order to be fully informed as to the nature and severity of the illness or injury,<br/>and to report such finding to the Superintendent or designee. If the report concludes that the absence is not<br/>due to personal illness or injury, or that the illness is not sufficiently severe to warrant continued absence<br/>then the Superintendent or designee, after notice to the unit member, may refuse to grant such leave. If<br/>requested by the district management a unit member shall not return to work until a medical doctor's<br/>authorization to return to work is submitted at district's expense.</p>

A unit member shall make a<br/>reasonable attempt to notify the district prior to the dismissal time of the final class of</p>
<p>the work day, of the employee's intent to return or not to return the following day.</p>

Such unused leave of<br/>absence for illness or injury will be credited to the paid employee only upon receipt of official notice from the<br/>California school district of prior employment and verification of the amount of unused sick leave. Such credit<br/>for unused leave of absence for illness or injury will be given only to employees who have been employed by<br/>a California school district in the year prior to the acceptance of employment in the district When an<br/>employee terminates employment after one year or longer with the district and accepts employment with</p>
<p>another California school district in the succeeding year, the unused leave of absence for illness or injury<br/>shall be computed and forwarded to the new district of employment upon request.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Sick Leave</p>
<p>10.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall maintain an RBTA Catastrophic Leave Bank. This Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be<br/>maintained to provide paid leave to bargaining unit members who have exhausted all earned sick leave<br/>as described in Section 10.1 above who are suffering from catastrophic illnesses or injuries as verified by<br/>a physician and are not receiving benefits provided by any income protection insurance program.<br/>Catastrophic leave shall also be available to unit members who need to care for an immediate family<br/>member who is suffering from a catastrophic illness or injury as verified by a physician. The District shall<br/>provide the Association upon request a statement of activity on the bank for the prior month as well as<br/>the monthly ending balance of days in the bank.</p>
<p>10.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A probationary or permanent unit member may donate up to five (5) days of sick leave per year to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank described in Section 10.2.1 above. Such donations shall be irrevocable. Sick<br/>leave which is donated under this section shall be deducted from the accrued sick leave authorized<br/>under Section 10.1 above. A bargaining unit member who wishes to donate sick leave shall execute an<br/>authorization for the donation of the sick leave and an assignment of the leave to the leave bank This<br/>authorization must confirm the understanding that the donation of sick leave to the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank is voluntary and irrevocable. The authorization must further indicate unit member agreement to<br/>indemnify and hold the District and the Association harmless from any claims, demands, or causes of<br/>action related to the donation. Solicitations for donations to the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be the<br/>sole responsibility of the Association.</p>
<p>10.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A catastrophic illness or injury shall be defined by Education Code Section 44043.5.

<p>10.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall not be a diminution of employment status while on leave for child bearing or child rearing except<br/>that no unit member shall be entitled to compensation, increment nor shall the time taken on parental leave<br/>count toward credit for probationary unit members in earning tenure status.</p>
<p>10.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is on leave for child bearing or child rearing and in the event of a miscarriage or death of a<br/>child subsequent to childbirth, the unit member may request an immediate assignment to a unit position.

<p>10.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any days of absence from duty as a result of the same industrial accident the unit member shall<br/>endorse to the District any wage loss benefit check from the appropriate insurance fund which would make<br/>the total compensation from both sources exceed 100% of the amount the unit member would have received<br/>as salary had there been no industrial accident or illness. If the unit member fails to endorse to the District<br/>any wage loss disability indemnity check received on account of the industrial accident or illness as provided<br/>above, the District shall deduct from the unit member's salary warrant the amount of such disability indemnity<br/>actually paid to and retained by the unit member.</p>

Upon direction of the supervisor, the unit member shall seek a postponement of jury<br/>duty to a time most convenient to the District.

<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been employed for at least 12 months; and</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has actually worked for at least 1,250 hours during the 12 month period immediately<br/>preceding the commencement of the leave.</p>
<p>10.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permitted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the following reasons:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the birth of a child or to care for a newborn of a member;</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the placement of a child with a member in connection with the adoption or foster care of a<br/>child.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave to care for a child, parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition; or</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave because of a serious health condition that makes the member unable to perform the<br/>function of his/her position.</p>
<p>10.13.2.1 A serious health condition includes an illness, injury impairment, or physical<br/>or mental condition that involves:</p>
<p>a) any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with a hospital, hospice<br/>or residential medical care facility; or <sup>36</sup></p>
<p>36</p>

<p>10.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of Leave</p>
<p>Eligible unit members are entitled to a total of twelve (12) workweeks of leave during any twelve (12)<br/>month period. A member’s entitlement to leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster<br/>care expires twelve (12) months after the birth or placement.</p>
<p>The twelve month period for calculating leave entitlement will be a “rolling period” measured forward<br/>from the date leave is taken and continues with each additional leave day taken.</p>
<p>A member’s request for leave of less than two weeks duration will not be granted absent medical<br/>certification that such leave is medically necessary.</p>
<p>If the District employs both parents, their aggregate leaves for birth, adoption, or foster care<br/>placement shall not exceed 12 workweeks in 1 twelve month period.</p>
<p>10.13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members Benefits While on Leave</p>
<p>Leave under this Article is unpaid. While on leave, unit members will continue to be covered by the<br/>District’s medical, dental, and vision insurance. However, unit members will not be covered under the<br/>District’s income protection and other benefit plans unless members make the appropriate contributions<br/>for continued coverage.</p>
<p>If a unit member fails to return to work after his/her leave entitlement has been exhausted, the District<br/>shall have the right to recover its share of health plan premiums for the entire leave period, unless the<br/>member does not return because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition<br/>which would entitle the member to leave, or due to other circumstances beyond the control of the<br/>employee. The District shall have the right to recover premiums through deductions from any sums due<br/>the unit member (e.g. unpaid wages, vacation pay, etc.).</p>
<p>10.13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Other Accrued Leaves While on Leave</p>
<p>Unit members shall first use all applicable sick leave and other applicable paid leaves before being eligible for<br/>leave hereunder. Family Care and Medical Leave shall run concurrently with such paid leaves.</p>
<p>10.13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Certification</p>
<p>A. The District may require members who request leave to provide written certification from the health<br/>care provider of the individual requiring care. If the leave is requested because of the member’s own<br/>serious health condition, the certification must include a statement that the member is unable to<br/>perform the essential functions of his/her position.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District has reason to doubt the validity of a certification, the District may require a medical<br/>opinion of a second health care provider chosen by the District. If the second opinion is different<br/>from the first, the District may require the opinion of a third provider approved by the District and the<br/>member. The opinion of the third provider will be binding.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require certification of the serious medical condition of a family member,<br/>including a health care provider’s certification that the unit member is needed to care for the family<br/>member.</p>
<p>10.13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member Notice of Leave</p>
<p>Although the District recognizes that emergencies arise which may require members to request<br/>immediate leave, members are required to give as much notice as possible of their need for leave. If<br/>leave is foreseeable, at least thirty (30) days notice is required. In addition, if a member knows that<br/>he/she will need leave in the future, but does not know the exact date(s) (e.g. for the birth of a child or to<br/>take care of a newborn) the member shall inform his/her supervisor as soon as possible that such leave<br/>will be needed. If the District determines that a member’s notice is inadequate or the member knew<br/>about the requested leave in advance of the request, the District may delay the granting of the leave until<br/>it can, in its discretion, adequately cover the position with a substitute.</p>
<p>10.13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon conclusion of the leave, if the employee is able to resume his/her employment, he/she shall be<br/>reinstated to the same or comparable position as held prior to commencing such leave. The guarantee<br/>of reinstatement may not apply where for legitimate business reasons, unrelated to the taking of leave,<br/>the employee’s position has been eliminated, provided the employee is accorded the same layoff and<br/>recall rights and status as he/she would have had if working at the time of layoff. Nothing herein<br/>precludes the District from dismissing the employee for cause (permanent) or for valid reasons (if<br/>probationary).</p>
<p>As a condition of restoration of a member whose leave was due to the member’s own serious health<br/>condition, which made the member unable to perform his/her job, the member shall obtain and present a<br/>fitness-for-duty certification from a health care provider that the member is able to return to work. Failure<br/>to provide such certification will result in denial of restoration.</p>
<p>10.13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for Leave Unit members shall fill out the “Request for Family and medical leave Form” prepared<br/>by the District to be eligible for leave. This form will enable the District to satisfy its record keeping</p>
<p>obligations.</p>
<p>10.14 JobSharing</p>
<p>10.14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may authorize teams of two tenured unit members to share a full-time teaching<br/>assignment. The team may include a second-year probationary teacher who does not receive a notice<br/>of non-reelection by March 15.</p>
<p>10.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared teaching assignments shall refer to two (2) unit members sharing one (1) full-time position. Job<br/>sharing may occur involving proportionate teaching responsibilities in amounts of other than 50/50%.<br/>Upon the termination of the shared assignment, the unit members shall be returned to the proportion of<br/>a full-time assignment, or a higher proportion if mutually agreed upon by the unit member and the<br/>District, held prior to the job share.</p>
<p>10.14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared teaching assignments will be filled only by tenured unit members who have jointly agreed to<br/>work together and who have submitted a written proposal for shared teaching to the site Principal(s).<br/>The proposal must be submitted on a form developed by the District in direct consultation with the<br/>Association. The proposal must be received on or before March 31 of each school year prior to the<br/>year in which the shared teaching assignment is being requested.</p>
<p>38</p>

Unit members shall have the right to<br/>submit a written response to such documents, which shall be attached to them.</p>
<p>14.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No complaint shall be utilized for the purpose of disciplinary action against a unit member unless that complaint<br/>has been duly investigated by the District and the unit member has been given an opportunity to respond to<br/>allegations derived from the investigation. Unit members shall have the opportunity to respond either orally to</p>
<p>48</p>

<p>REDONDO BEACH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>Certificated Teacher Evaluation Process</p>
<p>2011-2012</p>
<p>APPENDIX F</p>
<p>The primary purpose of teacher evaluation is to recognize good teaching practices and assist teachers in the<br/>improvement of instruction and management of students through the objective and continuing assessment of<br/>teacher effectiveness. Teachers receive feedback and constructive assistance based upon classroom observations<br/>and student performance. The evaluation of all certificated staff by school administrators is conducted on a<br/>continuing basis according to the contract.</p>
<p>The California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) are used to define and support effective<br/>teaching. The six standards are interrelated, and each standard describes specific elements of effective teaching<br/>practice.</p>
<p>Standard 1: Engaging and Supporting all Students in Learning</p>
<p>Standard 2: Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning</p>
<p>Standard 3: Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning</p>
<p>Standard 4: Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for all Students</p>
