Such remuneration shall only apply on<br/>days a regular full-time employee is contracted to work.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Teacher Participants (PT)</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Program is to assist and offer remediation to PTs whose<br/>performance has been evaluated as “unsatisfactory” in one (1) or more of the Gold<br/>Trail Teaching Standards by the Site Administrator. In addition, it shall be the<br/>obligation of the Panel to report the results of this intervention to the Board of<br/>Education of the school district. The written documentation in the evaluation<br/>report shall become a part of the PT’s personnel file.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime focus of this Program is to provide assistance and renew quality<br/>teaching.</p>

The conference shall involve the teacher<br/>and the CT to begin the development of an Individual Learning Plan. If the PT so<br/>desires, the Federation shall provide representation in this meeting.</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of assistance, the PT’s evaluation shall be the joint responsibility<br/>of the CT and the administrator. It is the intent of the parties that this process<br/>serve as the sole evaluation process for the PT and that it be based on the PT’s<br/>adherence to the Gold Trail Teaching Standards and Article X (Evaluation) of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>36</p>

<p>The assistance shall be provided by the CT under this article and shall be closely<br/>monitored by the Panel.</p>
<p>vi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication and consultation with the Site Administrator shall be ongoing.</p>
<p>vii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this article precludes the Site Administrator or District from doing<br/>informal observations nor from notifying the teacher verbally and/or in writing<br/>regarding incidents or events related to the teacher’s fulfillment of his/her<br/>professional obligations.</p>
<p>a. Should the Site Administrator deem it necessary to communicate with a<br/>teacher in this intervention program in a manner that relates to<br/>progressive discipline; i.e., letter of warning, reprimand, etc., he/she may<br/>send a copy to the CT who shall report the same to the Panel.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple classroom observations by the CT;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance specific to the Standard which has been evaluated to be<br/>“unsatisfactory;” and other areas deemed in need of assistance by the CT<br/>during the period of assistance;</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties understand that every possible subject matter competency<br/>may not be available within the corps of CTs, and therefore, it shall<br/>occasionally be necessary to secure additional assistance to fully address<br/>identified deficiencies. In such cases, the CT shall maintain prime<br/>responsibility for the Individual Learning Plan.</p>
<p>xi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the year of remediation, the Panel shall report to the PT, the<br/>Site Administrator, and the Board of Trustees of the School District that:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the PT is now “proficient” in the Gold Trail Teaching Standards, and<br/>the Site Administrator shall evaluate the unit member using the<br/>administrative evaluation option; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding xi above, and while the term of this assistance shall<br/>normally be for one (1) school year, the intervention shall be extended to a<br/>second year if the Panel believes progress is being made although the PT<br/>may not have returned to a “proficient” level of performance; or</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>c. The Panel and CT do not consider that further assistance and remediation<br/>will be successful with reasons in support of this conclusion. The District<br/>may then initiate dismissal proceedings or may send the member back to<br/>the Site Administrator for evaluation the next year,</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who accepts an assignment under this Article shall receive a salary equal to<br/>a pro rata share of what his/her salary would be under a regular full-time contract.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is at least a .5 FTE employee and contributes additional monies to<br/>purchase full health benefit coverage, the District shall contribute toward the cost of health<br/>benefit coverage an amount equal to a pro rata share of the District’s contribution for a full¬<br/>time employee.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s and the District’s contribution to the retirement system will be based on<br/>the actual salary paid. The employee will receive only the pro rata service credits toward<br/>years of experience as computed by the State Teachers Retirement System.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave benefits are accrued based on the prorated normal rate.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For less-than-full-day scheduled work assignments, preparation periods will be factored in<br/>the proration; accommodating entitled preparation time.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitutes</p>
<p>When a teacher in the shared contract uses a day of sick leave, the person sharing the contract<br/>with that individual will, whenever possible, trade with the partner. When this occurs, there will be<br/>no deduction of sick leave. However, there will be a pay-back day charged to that individual. Pay¬<br/>back days are defined as those days when the certificated partner substituted. If pay-back days do<br/>not equal out between sharing individuals at the end of the year, sick days shall be deducted and<br/>the teaching partner paid for the extra days as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first three (3) extra days the teaching partner shall be paid at his/her prevailing rate of<br/>pay.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any days beyond the first three (3) extra days, the teaching partner shall be paid at the<br/>substitute rate of pay.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both members of the team are to assume full responsibility for the total classroom and<br/>instructional program planning. They will:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop lesson plans together, which will present a cohesive, well-coordinated<br/>curriculum adhering to the District’s goals and objectives.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish classroom discipline standards and expectations, which will be consistently<br/>applied and clearly defined.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish consistent and well-defined student achievement evaluation practices.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop an appropriate plan with a calendar which clearly states who will be<br/>responsible for the teaching and learning. Should the plan be modified, the District<br/>shall be notified before the change occurs.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confer to mutually prepare for all parent conferences on each child’s progress as is<br/>expected of teachers on full-time contracts.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actively participate in school and faculty activities and meetings on a pro rata basis.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both members of a team are required to take an active part in all District and school in-service,<br/>staff and other meetings, parent conferences, yard duties and other duties. If such do not occur on<br/>his/her workdays, they shall be paid pursuant to Article XI.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one (1) partner does not continue for the full period of the assignment, and if the remaining<br/>partner’s most recent evaluation was satisfactory and the partner is on leave from a full-time<br/>position, that partner may opt to assume the full-time position or may request that the District assist<br/>in obtaining a replacement partner.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>If the assignment is terminated by either the District or the employee at the end of the first school<br/>year, then the employee shall be returned to the assignment he/she held prior to the shared<br/>contract, if the assignment exists. If the assignment is terminated by the District or the employee at<br/>the end of the second year or beyond, the employee will be offered a position for which he/she is<br/>credentialed, as provided by law and the collective bargaining agreement. An employee who is on<br/>leave from a full-time position shall notify the District by February 15 of his/her intention to return to<br/>a position for the upcoming school year.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Article XVIII</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>A “grievance” is an allegation by an employee of the adverse effect of a misapplication, misrepresentation,<br/>or violation of a specific provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>A “grievant” is any party covered by the terms of this Agreement and/or the Federation.</p>
<p>Step One: Informal Level</p>
<p>An alleged grievance shall be presented for informal discussion with the Site Administrator within<br/>twenty (20) work days after the grievant knew or reasonably should have known of the condition<br/>upon which the grievance is based. The Site Administrator shall respond to the grievant within ten<br/>(10) work days with his/her decision.</p>
<p>Step Two: Formal Written</p>
<p>In the event the matter is not resolved informally, a written grievance shall be filed within ten (10)<br/>work days of the Site Administrator’s response at the informal level. The grievant shall inform the<br/>Site Administrator of the specific section (s) of the Agreement which gave rise to the grievance,<br/>and the circumstances involved; and the specific remedy sought. Within ten (10) work days, the<br/>Site Administrator shall communicate in writing to the grievant his/her decision together with<br/>supporting reasons.</p>
<p>Step Three: Formal Written</p>
<p>If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant, the grievant may appeal the<br/>decision in writing to the Superintendent within ten (10) work days after receiving the Step Two<br/>decision.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) work days from the date of receiving the grievance, the Superintendent shall<br/>communicate his/her decision to the grievant in writing. At the request of either party, a meeting<br/>shall be held including all parties before the issuance of a decision.</p>
<p>Step Four: Mediation</p>
<p>Within ten (10) work days from the date of receiving the Superintendent’s Step Three decision, the<br/>Federation may appeal to mediation to assist the parties in resolving the issue. A mediator from<br/>the California Mediation and Conciliation Service shall be used.</p>
<p>Step Five: Arbitration</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step Four, the Federation may<br/>request a hearing before an arbitrator within fifteen (15) work days.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the request for arbitration, the Superintendent shall request a list of arbitrators from the<br/>California Mediation and Conciliation Service. As soon as possible after receiving the list of names from<br/>the Service, representatives of the District and the Federation shall alternately strike a name until one (1)<br/>name remains. The person named shall serve as arbitrator.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing at which both parties may present witnesses and<br/>evidence. The arbitrator shall render a decision on the issue(s) submitted.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing, and after both parties have had an opportunity to make oral and written<br/>arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to the parties his/her decision. The decision of<br/>the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and presenting its own case in arbitration. All fees<br/>and expenses of the arbitrator and the arbitration process shall be shared equally by the<br/>parties. The grievant, the grievant’s representative, and the grievant’s witnesses shall be<br/>compensated at the regular rate and provided a substitute if the arbitration hearing is held<br/>during scheduled class time.</p>
<p>Handling of Grievance Documents</p>
<p>All documents, communications, and records pertaining to a grievance shall be placed in a<br/>separate grievance file in the GTUSD District Office. Any document or record removed from a<br/>personnel file or any other file for use in a grievance shall be returned to the original file.</p>
<p>After the informal step, all grievances shall be processed on the Gold Trail Grievance form<br/>(Appendix D). Grievance forms shall be available for unit members at each site.</p>
<p>No Reprisals</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the Board or by any member of the administration<br/>against anyone by reason of participation in the grievance procedure or support of any participant<br/>thereto.</p>
<p>Time Limits</p>
<p>Failure by the District at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance<br/>within the specified time limits shall result in an automatic appeal to the next step of the procedure.<br/>Failure by the grievant to conform to timelines will result in the grievance being settled. The<br/>specified time limits in this procedure may be extended by mutual agreement, in writing, between<br/>the parties.</p>
<p>Other Procedures or Remedies</p>
<p>The grievance procedure provided in this Agreement shall be supplementary to, rather than<br/>exclusive of, any procedures or remedies afforded to an employee by law.</p>
<p>Representation</p>
<p>Either party may be accompanied by a representative of his/her own choosing at any level of the<br/>procedure. However, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>employee having a grievance to discuss the matter with any appropriate member of the<br/>administration, and to have the grievance resolved without intervention of the Federation -<br/>provided, however, that the resolution of the grievance is consistent with this Agreement and that<br/>prior to any agreement on the resolution of a grievance, the Federation has received a copy of the<br/>grievance and the proposed resolution. Such resolution shall not be precedent setting.</p>
<p>Pending Grievances</p>
<p>While a grievance is pending, the grievant shall continue the assigned functions until the resolution<br/>of the grievance is final.</p>
<p>Release Time</p>
<p>Insofar as possible, the processing of the grievance shall take place outside of class time.<br/>However, the grievant and his/her representative shall be provided a reasonable amount of release<br/>time to process the grievance.</p>
<p>The grievant, representative, and any necessary witnesses shall be granted paid release time to<br/>attend any hearing required by this grievance process.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>Article XIX</p>
<p>TERM OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement for the 2012-2015 contract years<br/>and thereafter until a successor agreement is negotiated.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall sunshine the initial proposal on the 2015-18 Agreement no later than<br/>the September 2015 regular meeting of the Board.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon mutual agreement the parties may reopen any Article.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to commence negotiations no later than September of 2015.</p>
<p>Agreed to and ratified by both parties as of this 5<sup>th</sup> day in February, 2015, in Placerville,<br/>California.</p>
