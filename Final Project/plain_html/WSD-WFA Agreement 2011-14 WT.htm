<p>ARTICLE 1: AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding Agreement<br/>by and between the District and the Association. It is understood and agreed that the<br/>specific provisions contained in this Agreement shall prevail over District practices,<br/>procedures, past Agreements, and over state laws to the extent permitted by those laws.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Division 4, Title 1, Chapter 10.7, Sections<br/>3540-3549 of the Government Code of the State of California. If any provision of this<br/>Agreement is, or shall be at any time contrary to law, then such provision shall not be<br/>applicable or performed or enforced except to the extent permitted by law. In the event<br/>that any provision of this Agreement is, or shall be at any time contrary to law, all other<br/>provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall remain in effect from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014, with<br/>reopeners for 2012-13 and 2013-14 on salary, health benefits, and two other Articles<br/>selected by each party. Four Articles in total.</p>
<p>For the 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 school year the student calendar will be 175 days<br/>(teacher work calendar will be 178 days) and teachers will take 7 furlough days as<br/>reflected in the 2010-11 WFA salary schedule.</p>

<p>Base Revenue Limit per ADA, after State Deficit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$5,123.08</p>
<p>For 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14, if the funded Base revenue Limit per student received by<br/>the District in any one of the foregoing years, after applying State Deficit and any other<br/>State-imposed offset (Base Revenue Limit per ADA, after State Deficit - $5,123.08), is<br/>reduced by $50.00 or more, the District may open negotiations regarding the student<br/>calendar and increasing WFA unit member furlough days and a proportionate reduction<br/>in salary.</p>
<p>For 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14, if the funded Base Revenue Limit per student received<br/>by the District in any one of the foregoing years, after applying State Deficit and any<br/>other State-imposed offset (Base Revenue Limit per ADA, after State Deficit -<br/>$5,123.08), is increased by $50.00 or more, WFA may open negotiations regarding</p>

The Association shall<br/>have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether any claim, liability, suit or<br/>judgment made or brought against the District or the Association because of such action<br/>shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended or appealed.</p>

If<br/>successful in filling one of these openings, there shall be no announced vacancy<br/>and the person filling the position shall be considered as a voluntary transfer.</p>
<p>7.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other vacancies shall be filled in accordance with Sections 7.3 or 7.4 if</p>
<p>necessary.</p>
<p>7.3 Voluntary Transfers</p>
<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request a voluntary transfer to take effect during the current<br/>school year or at the beginning of the next school year. In either event, the<br/>request shall be made on a “Request for Transfer” form and sent to the<br/>Superintendent. All unit members returning from leave and/or those returning to<br/>a full-time assignment shall be considered as voluntary transfers. Permanent unit<br/>members shall have precedence over temporary unit members in the<br/>consideration of voluntary transfers in accordance with Section 7.3.4.</p>
<p>(a) Effective July 1, 2006, a unit member will be allotted up to a maximum of<br/>$500 for instructional materials and/or supplies when voluntarily changing<br/>grade levels or schools. This includes the first year of “looping” but no<br/>subsequent years (e.g. each unit member involved in a “loop” will receive a<br/>total of $500).</p>
<p>The total amount of money allotted for these voluntary transfers shall not<br/>exceed $3,500 district-wide in one school year for voluntary and involuntary<br/>transfers. Should more than 7 voluntary transfers be approved the $3,500<br/>will be divided evenly among the unit members. Share assignment unit<br/>members shall be considered one teaching unit and eligible for up to the<br/>maximum of $500 ($250 each) or a prorated amount</p>
<p>A unit member will be extended up to (3) days of release time to observe<br/>classes/operations if needed, not to exceed a district-wide total of $1,500 per<br/>year for voluntary and involuntary transfers.</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the fifth (5th) day of posting the announcement of a vacancy that<br/>occurs during the school year, the District may proceed with filling the position.</p>
<p>7.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the request is made for a transfer to take effect at the beginning<br/>of the next school year, tentative notification shall be given the unit members as<br/>soon as administratively possible but no later than September 1 unless there are<br/>extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>7.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for evaluating a request for voluntary transfer shall be (listing does<br/>not imply any priority order):</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate credential</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority</p>
<p>Page 7</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educationally related needs of the District</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order of selection:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members currently employed</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on leave</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary unit members</p>
<p>7.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary transfer requests shall be given priority consideration over involuntary<br/>transfers except in the following cases:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such action would result in the layoff of another unit member.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such action would prevent the District from attending to the<br/>educationally related needs of the District.</p>
<p>7.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for transfer are valid for one (1) year, and prior year requests shall<br/>automatically be discarded on October 1 of the succeeding year.</p>
<p>7.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for transfer not withdrawn prior to the last day of school each year shall<br/>be considered valid for openings occurring during the summer; however, a<br/>request for transfer may be withdrawn in writing at any time prior to the granting<br/>of the transfer.</p>
<p>7.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a voluntary transfer request for which there was a vacancy is denied, the unit<br/>member, upon request, shall be provided in writing with the reasons for the<br/>denial.</p>
<p>7.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a voluntary transfer occurs during the school year the unit member may<br/>have up to three (3) days release time for observation and preparation.</p>
<p>7.4 Involuntary Transfer</p>
<p>7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be involuntarily transferred if there is another unit member<br/>with less District-wide seniority, who is credentialed to fill the vacancy unless it<br/>can be demonstrated that such a transfer is based on the educationally related<br/>needs of the District.</p>
<p>(a) Effective July 1, 2006, a unit member will be allotted up to a maximum of<br/>$500 for instructional materials and/or supplies when involuntarily changing<br/>grade levels or schools.</p>
<p>The total amount of money allotted for these involuntary transfers shall not<br/>exceed $3,500 district wide in one school year for involuntary and voluntary<br/>transfers. Should more than 7 voluntary transfers be approved the $3,500<br/>will be divided evenly among the unit members. Share assignment unit<br/>members shall be considered one teaching unit and eligible for up to the<br/>maximum of $500 ($250 each) or a prorated amount.</p>
<p>7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A properly credentialed unit member who faces involuntary transfer due to<br/>elimination of his/her position and who has District-wide seniority over other<br/>unit members within that school, may by reason of that seniority be entitled to<br/>remain at that school, and the unit member who is lowest in seniority shall be<br/>transferred to another open position in the District. If the person at that school</p>
<p>who is lowest in District-wide seniority has been involuntarily transferred within<br/>the past three (3) years, the next in line according to seniority shall be transferred.<br/>The same procedure would follow with involuntary grade level transfers at the<br/>same school. Unit members involuntarily transferred to another grade level<br/>within the last three (3) years may stay at that grade level and the person next in<br/>line according to seniority shall have to transfer.</p>
<p>7.4.3 Unit members to be involuntarily transferred shall have the right to indicate<br/>preferences from a list of vacancies available at that time. The District shall take<br/>action on such requests basing the decision on (listing does not imply any priority</p>

</table>
<p>7.4.4 Within five (5) working days after the decision has been made a unit member<br/>who is to be involuntarily transferred, shall, upon request, be notified in writing<br/>and the reasons for the transfer stated. When an involuntary transfer occurs<br/>during the school year, the unit member may have up to five (5) days release<br/>time, not to exceed a district wide total of $1,500 per year for involuntary and<br/>voluntary transfers, for observation and preparation. Release time shall be<br/>granted only after the unit member’s plans have been approved by the principal.</p>
<p>7.5 Miscellaneous</p>
<p>7.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to assist the unit member in moving all materials to the new<br/>work location regardless of what time of year the transfer occurs.</p>
<p>7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be notified in writing before the close of the school year of<br/>their tentative assignments and work location for the coming year. If tentative<br/>teaching assignments are changed during the summer, unit members shall be<br/>notified by phone or mail addressed to the unit member’s current mailing address<br/>on file with the District.</p>
<p>7.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a combination class is necessary which eliminates a position, the unit members<br/>involved, along with the site administrator, shall attempt to resolve the<br/>assignment. Failing to do so the choice to accept or deny the assignment is<br/>determined by seniority unless the educational needs of the District shall be<br/>impaired. The remaining (unassigned) unit members shall be subject to the<br/>provisions of Section 7.4 (Involuntary Transfer). If a combination class is<br/>eliminated and there is an opening for either grade level served by that<br/>combination class, the unit member from the combination class shall have first<br/>choice at filling the position(s).</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher to have grade specific experience.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher to have classroom management and discipline strategies.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher applies for, but does not get a summer session position, the selection<br/>panel must provide feedback to that teacher as to why someone else was selected.<br/>This would allow the teacher to improve and/or enhance future proposals.</p>

<p>Frequency of Evaluation:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary, temporary, and/or teachers assigned for more than one (1) semester<br/>and covered by this Agreement shall be evaluated each school year. Share<br/>assignment unit members on Temporary Contract may be evaluated less<br/>frequently at the discretion of the site administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenured teachers shall be evaluated every other school year.</p>
<p>Page 18</p>

A<br/>written summary and follow-up conference of a drop-in observation are optional<br/>and at the discretion of the principal or request of the unit member. Pertinent<br/>cumulative information from such summaries may be used in the final evaluation<br/>report, but the individual summaries themselves shall not go in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>General Procedures of Evaluation:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members scheduled to be evaluated during a particular school year shall be<br/>furnished a copy of the evaluation procedures, advised of the criteria upon which<br/>the evaluation is to be based, and notified of the identity of their evaluator within<br/>the first four (4) weeks of the year in which the evaluation is to take place.</p>

<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a good faith effort to resolve the differences themselves.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the disagreement persists, the parties may, by mutual<br/>agreement, invite a third party to assist in resolving the<br/>differences. The third party shall recommend alternatives to the<br/>unit member and evaluator.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either the unit member or evaluator reject the proposed<br/>alternatives, each shall have the opportunity to state their<br/>position on the matter(s) in dispute, and to have a written<br/>statement attached to the evaluation form, and the matter will be<br/>resolved through the grievance process.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have the right to identify any constraints which the unit<br/>member believes may inhibit his/her ability to meet the Professional</p>
<p>Page 19</p>
<p>Development Plan established. The unit member may request support such as<br/>conferences, in-service, information, and books.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, circumstances may change which<br/>require modification of the Professional Development Plan. The unit member<br/>may initiate a change of the Professional Development Plan by written<br/>notification and mutual agreement.</p>
