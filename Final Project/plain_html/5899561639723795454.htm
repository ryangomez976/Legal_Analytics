<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by a joint committee comprised</p>
<p>of two members appointed by the Association and two members appointed by the<br/>District. The terms of the committee shall be staggered two-year terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial</p>
<p>appointments shall be for one or two years.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members on active duty with the District are eligible to contribute to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires annual contribution to the Bank. Only<br/>contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank during the<br/>annual enrollment period have a waiting period of thirty days after joining the<br/>bank before becoming eligible to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution, on the appropriate form, shall be authorized by the unit member<br/>and continued from year to year until canceled by the unit member.</p>
<p>5. Cancellation, on the proper from, may be effected at any time and the unit member<br/>shall not be eligible to draw from the Bank as of the effective date of the cancellation.<br/>Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to the bank shall not be returned if<br/>the unit member effects cancellation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each school year. Unit<br/>members returning from extended leave which included the enrollment period and<br/>new hires will be permitted to contribute within thirty calendar days of beginning<br/>work.

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants whose sick leave is exhausted may withdraw<br/>from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury. Catastrophic illness or injury shall be<br/>defined as any illness or injury that incapacitates a unit member or a member of the<br/>unit member’s family for over ten consecutive duty days which requires the unit<br/>member to take time off work to care for that immediate family member as defined by<br/>Article XVI Section D.2 in the CUTA District Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten days of illness or disability must be covered by the unit member’s own<br/>sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay. Wthdrawals shall become<br/>effective immediately upon the exhaustion of sick leave or the waiting period,<br/>whatever is greater. For example, if a unit member contributed when first eligible to<br/>contribute and had ten days of accumulated sick leave when the illness began,<br/>she/he shall begin withdrawing upon the eleventh duty day, if otherwise eligible. If<br/>the unit member had fifteen days of sick leave at the beginning of the illness, she/he<br/>shall begin withdrawing days on the sixteenth duty day. If the unit member had five<br/>days of sick leave at the beginning of the illness, she/he shall begin withdrawing days<br/>on the eleventh duty day.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wthdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted on a daily basis not<br/>to exceed thirty days per request.

Members of the Committee shall keep information<br/>regarding the nature of the illness confidential. A unit member’s withdrawal from the<br/>bank may not exceed beyond the current school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualified the unit<br/>member for worker compensation benefits unless the unit member has exhausted all<br/>worker compensation leave and her/his own sick leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal<br/>request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide days and the District is<br/>under no obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If the Committee<br/>denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension of withdrawal, because of insufficient<br/>days to fund the request, they shall notify the unit member, in writing, of the reason<br/>for the denial.</p>
<p>D. Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>1. The committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the Bank. The<br/>committee shall approve all properly submitted requests complying with the terms<br/>of this Article. Wthdrawals may not be denied on the basis of the type of illness or<br/>disability.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 5 of each school year, the District shall notify the committee of the total<br/>number of days available in the Bank.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be returned to the then current members of the<br/>Bank proportionately.</p>

<p>52</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXX</p>
<p>JUST CAUSE AND DUE PROCESS</p>
<p>A. Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is to establish just cause and due process for disciplinary actions<br/>affecting bargaining unit members up to short- term suspensions without pay.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bargaining unit member will be disciplined, reduced in rank or compensation, nor<br/>otherwise subjected to adverse action as a result of alleged misconduct, without<br/>“just cause.”</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties endorse the utilization of this Agreement and the contractual grievance<br/>proceedings. Any alleged misconduct which can be remedied by progressive discipline<br/>must be remedied in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District action to terminate employment remunerated under “Extra Pay for Extra<br/>Services” contracts as specified in this Agreement shall not be reviewable<br/>under this article unless such termination is for a disciplinable offense.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, bargaining unit members have the right to secure and utilize<br/>Association representation for any disciplinary considerations.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members shall have the right to rebut any written warning or<br/>reprimand by submitting a written statement of their position. Such written rebuttal<br/>shall be attached to the warning or reprimand.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member shall acknowledge receipt of all documents intended for<br/>placement in his/her personnel file in the manner set forth in the “Personnel File”<br/>article of this Agreement. The unit member’s acknowledgement shall not be deemed<br/>to indicate their agreement with the contents of the document.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levels of Progressive Discipline</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level: The parties agree that disciplinary questions and/or issues are best<br/>resolved by means of objective discussion between supervisors and bargaining unit<br/>members. This is the first step prior to formal discipline.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Warnings: Written warnings issued to the bargaining unit member constitute<br/>the first level of formal discipline.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Reprimand:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written reprimands for placement into the bargaining unit</p>
<p>member’s personnel file constitute the second level of formal discipline. The District<br/>must append to the reprimand any prior written warnings and/or reprimands which<br/>are to be relied upon for any purpose.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspensions without Pay:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reprimand for placement into the</p>
<p>bargaining unit member’s personnel file, or suspensions without pay (not to exceed<br/>fifteen [15] working days), shall constitute the third level of formal discipline. The<br/>District must append to the reprimand any prior written warnings and/or reprimands<br/>which are to be relied upon for any purpose.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation: While progressive discipline levels may not be bypassed arbitrarily<br/>or capriciously, it is mutually recognized that certain conditions warrant full or partial<br/>bypass of such levels.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains its right to suspend with pay in accordance with the California</p>
<p>Education Code. In the event the District subsequently seeks to invoke formal<br/>discipline under grounds covered by this article, such action will be governed<br/>under the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gross Misconduct” warranting immediate implementation of dismissal<br/>proceedings in accordance with the California Education Code.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious misconduct of such a critical nature that it justifies bypassing earlier levels</p>
<p>of progressive discipline.</p>
<p>D. Notice and Appeal of Suspension without Pay</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may suspend a unit member without pay for fifteen (15) workdays or less<br/>per school year for just cause. Before discipline is imposed, the District shall notify<br/>the unit member, in writing, at least five (5) workdays prior to implementation of such<br/>proposed disciplinary action.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice shall contain a specific statement of the act(s), omission(s), or infraction(s)<br/>upon which the disciplinary action is based, the proposed disciplinary action to be<br/>taken by the District, and a statement of reasonable professional expectations, rules,<br/>regulations, or statutes which the unit member is alleged to have violated.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will be provided a notice of the right to appeal the proposed<br/>suspension by filing a written request, within five (5) workdays of service of the<br/>notice, to meet with and respond to the Superintendent as to why the unit member<br/>should not be suspended without pay.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) workdays following the meeting with and opportunity to respond, the<br/>Superintendent shall notify the unit member of his/her determination. The decision of<br/>the Superintendent shall be final.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>E.</p>
<p>Derogatory Information</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel records are mandatory permanent records which the district is required by<br/>law to retain indefinitely (5 Cal Code Regs Section 16023).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, formal discipline documents will be sealed in a<br/>bargaining unit member’s personnel file upon request of the member, if at least four<br/>years have passed without further misconduct.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealed documents shall be placed in a sealed envelope in the personnel file and not<br/>used for any purpose or released to anyone without the member’s written consent,<br/>except as follows: (1) by order of a court of competent jurisdiction that member’s<br/>interest in confidentiality yield to the disclosure of some or all of any such documents;</p>
<p>(2) in response to a lawful subpoena; (3) in the event of litigation between the parties;</p>
<p>(4) as otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>F. Mutual Disciplines</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree to conform to the following disciplines in order to</p>
<p>provide for fair, thorough and objective joint consideration in any proceeding:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable good faith disclosure of known facts, circumstances and evidence relied<br/>upon by the District in its determination of disciplinary action.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diligent joint effort to effect appropriate confidentiality, proper interpersonal behavior<br/>and objective communication during initial consideration and subsequent review of<br/>any disciplinary issue.</p>
