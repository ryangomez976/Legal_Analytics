<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an Agreement made and entered into this twenty-seventh day of March, 2013, between<br/>the Oxnard Union High School District Board of Trustees, hereinafter referred to as &quot;District&quot;,<br/>and the Oxnard Federation of Teachers and School Employees, Local 1273, hereinafter referred<br/>to as &quot;Federation.&quot;</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District confirms its recognition of the Federation as the exclusive representative for that<br/>unit of employees defined as all full-time or part-time teachers, nurses, psychologists,<br/>counselors, speech therapists, Teacher Librarian, and Adult Education teachers.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Federation agree to support restructuring efforts which utilize site based<br/>decision making to encourage better ways of serving the needs of students and promotes<br/>enhanced student learning. If decisions made by school staff require the modification of the<br/>provisions of this Agreement, the District and Federation will approve such modifications in the<br/>following manner:</p>
<p>Modifications to the daily annual schedule (including banking minutes, additional period days,<br/>block scheduling, collaboration, or other changes associated with restructuring) may be<br/>implemented only upon the recommendation of a vote of certificated unit members at the site<br/>in question. This vote shall be conducted in a single day provided that absentee ballots are made<br/>available and include the option of maintaining the current schedule in addition to the proposed<br/>changes. These schedules shall be developed jointly by the site stakeholders. Modifications shall<br/>be ratified by a 2/3 majority of those voting (full-time or part-time, including those on<br/>sabbatical leave.) Voting will take place on site and be monitored by the principal and<br/>Federation representatives and shall take place no more than one time per year. This contract,<br/>unless otherwise indicated, addresses schools that operate on a traditional six-period day. Any<br/>modifications to the school day that alter the teacher workday, benefits, release time, and any<br/>other condition will be addressed through the consultation process.</p>

<p>Page 7</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5. NON-DISCRIMINATION</p>
<p>5.1 The District and Federation agree to follow policy not to unlawfully discriminate against any unit<br/>employee on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender, age, politics, disability,<br/>sexual orientation, membership or participation in an employee organization. Alleged violations of<br/>this Article may be processed under the provisions of the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure.</p>
<p>Page 8</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6. PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right and responsibility to take disciplinary action where there are instances of<br/>unprofessional conduct, or refusal to obey the school laws of the State or reasonable regulations<br/>prescribed for the government of public schools by the State Board of Education, the Credentialing<br/>Commission, or by the Governing Board of the Oxnard Union High School District, or by reasonable<br/>school-level administrative rules, or by the requirements of the negotiated agreement. However, the<br/>Federation and the District believe that the appropriate mechanism for the discipline of professionals<br/>is one that includes other professionals in the decisions. Toward that end, the Federation and the<br/>District want a procedure which matches the conduct and the discipline, and involves unit members<br/>in the disciplinary process as outlined below. The Federation recognizes its duty of fair<br/>representation to unit members which may include at the complete discretion of the Federation<br/>advice and counsel concerning the potential disciplinary action. The Federation and the District<br/>agree not to influence the panel members outside of any hearing and to work cooperatively in the<br/>training of individual unit members appointed to the disciplinary panels.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exercising this responsibility, the District agrees to progressively discipline, except where the<br/>severity of the offense requires otherwise. In all instances, the discipline applied must relate to the<br/>severity of the offense, be for just cause, and include the following due process procedure.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive discipline shall include the following:</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fevel 1. A verbal warning from site and/or District Administrators at a meeting where a<br/>Federation representative may attend should the unit member so request. The site or District<br/>administrator may have a witness to document the warning.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fevel 2. Written warnings shall not be placed in the unit member's official personnel file or<br/>be subject to the hearing process contained below. Written warnings shall be signed and<br/>dated by the unit member receiving them, preserved in a confidential file for no longer than<br/>one (1) calendar year from the date of the incident, and attached to any subsequent<br/>discipline of the unit member for inclusion in the unit member's personnel file to be used<br/>for support of disciplinary actions. A unit member may attach a rebuttal to the written<br/>warning and have both the warning and the rebuttal placed in the personnel file should the<br/>unit member elect. It is not intended that this provision prevent the placement of material<br/>related to the Evaluation process in the personnel file.</p>
<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fevel 3. A written reprimand may be issued for a severe or repeated infraction or violation.<br/>In that event, the unit member may respond in writing and have that writing attached to the<br/>reprimand and placed in the personnel file.</p>
<p>6.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fevel 4. A unit member may be suspended without pay, for up to fifteen (15) days, or have<br/>other corrective disciplinary action (s) consistent and appropriate for the type and severity<br/>of the offense. The unit member is entitled to a hearing upon written request.</p>
<p>6.3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member requests a hearing, a panel of three (3) Oxnard Union High<br/>School District certificated unit members shall be appointed to review the evidence<br/>and determine whether discipline is appropriate. It shall be within the authority<br/>of the panel after having reviewed the evidence to recommend private or public<br/>reproval, to determine whether suspension is appropriate, or to shorten the length<br/>of the recommended suspension.</p>
<p>6.3.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel shall be composed of one (1) certificated unit member appointed by the<br/>District, one (1) certificated unit member appointed by the Federation, and one<br/>(1) unit member selected from a list of six (6) names, three (3) submitted by the<br/>District and three (3) by the Federation. The order of striking shall be determined<br/>by lot.</p>
<p>6.3.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the unit members shall be taken from a list of trained disciplinary panel</p>
<p>Page 9</p>
<p>members appointed bi-annually by Federation and the District. The training for<br/>panel members shall include but not be limited to rules of conduct for panel<br/>members, topics of importance such as ex parte contact, burden of proof,<br/>questioning strategy, credibility determinations, rules of evidence, and other<br/>concepts of elemental fairness. If this disciplinary procedure is required prior to<br/>the training, the selected employees shall be trained prior to the hearing.</p>
<p>6.3.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be entitled to a hearing at which no attorneys would be<br/>present. The District and the Federation intend to balance the possible deprivation<br/>of unit member interests with the hearing process. Hearings are not intended to<br/>be courtroom dramas. The formal rules of evidence don't apply, and only key<br/>witnesses will be allowed to testify in front of the panel. All others will have their<br/>testimony conveyed to the panel by oath or affirmation given under penalty of<br/>perjury. In the event of a dispute over whether a witness may testify, the panel's<br/>determination shall be final. The total time for the hearing is restricted to four (4)<br/>hours (unless the panel specifically determines additional time is necessary for<br/>findings and recommendations for discipline).</p>
<p>6.3.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order of Case</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District presentation of witnesses and evidence.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panel questions.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accused questioning. (Limited to ten (10) minutes without panel approval</p>
<p>for extension.)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accused presentation of witnesses and evidence.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panel questions.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District questioning. (Limited to ten (10) minutes without panel approval for</p>
<p>extension.)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District final statement.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accused final statement.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panel questions on any topic (optional).</p>
<p>6.3.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel shall provide a written recommendation for discipline which contains<br/>findings of fact on key issues.</p>
<p>6.3.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the burden of proof.</p>
<p>6.3.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the panel determines that the discipline is not warranted, no record of the<br/>incident leading to the proposed discipline shall be contained in the unit member's<br/>personnel file. If the panel determines discipline is justified, a record of the<br/>findings shall be forwarded to the school principal for incorporation, if<br/>appropriate, in the evaluation process. It is intended that the decision of the panel<br/>is final and binding.</p>
<p>6.3.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the presentation of the case, at the request of either the District, the<br/>Federation, or the accused unit member, a mandatory settlement conference shall<br/>be held to explore a possible compromise. Settlements shall be in writing.</p>
<p>6.3.5 Except as disciplinary actions may be introduced in support of actions taken under<br/>Education Code Article 44932, this article shall not be construed as modifying those<br/>provisions or dismissal for cause. The parties intend that even the maximum penalty which<br/>can be imposed through this process is not intended to constitute a substantial deprivation<br/>of a unit member's property interest in his or her employment.</p>
<p>Page 10</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7. GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>7.1</p>
<p>General Provisions.</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance is defined as an allegation by a unit member or the Federation that the District<br/>has violated, misapplied or misinterpreted a specific term of this Agreement and that by<br/>reason of such violation the grievant believes that unit member rights have been adversely<br/>affected. All other matters and disputes of any nature are beyond the scope of these<br/>procedures. Also excluded from these procedures are those matters so indicated elsewhere<br/>in this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent in all cases shall be the District itself rather than any individual. The filing<br/>or pendency of a grievance shall not delay or interfere with implementation of any District<br/>action during the processing thereof.</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District makes an error which results in a cost to the Unit Share, and the Unit Share<br/>would not have incurred the cost had the error not been made, then the District will be<br/>financially responsible. Revenue projections, enrollment projections, or other Formula-<br/>related decisions do not constitute errors by the District subject to this provision.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level. Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall make a reasonable</p>
<p>attempt to resolve it by means of an informal conference with grievant's immediate administrator.</p>
<p>Either the grievant or immediate administrator may have a witness present at said informal</p>
<p>conference providing 24 hours advance notice is given to the other party.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level.</p>
<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I.</p>
<p>7.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee or the Federation wishes to initiate a formal grievance, the<br/>employee or Federation must do so within ten (10) workdays after the occurrence<br/>of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance by presenting such grievance in<br/>writing to the immediate administrator. If neither the grievant nor the Federation<br/>had actual or constructive knowledge of the occurrence of the grievable act or<br/>omission, and could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence have known<br/>about it, then the ten (10) day time limit shall begin to run on the date upon which<br/>either the grievant or Federation knew or could with reasonable diligence have<br/>known of the occurrence.</p>
<p>7.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written statement shall be a clear and concise statement of the grievance,<br/>including the specific provisions of the Agreement alleged to have been violated,<br/>misapplied or misinterpreted; the circumstances involved; and the specific remedy<br/>sought. The written statement described herein shall be submitted on a jointly-<br/>developed Grievance Form provided by the District, and said statement shall not<br/>be changed at later levels of the grievance and arbitration procedure, as described<br/>in this Article.</p>
<p>7.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may request a personal conference with the other party. The<br/>administration shall communicate a decision to the employee in writing within<br/>ten (10) workdays after receiving the grievance and such action will terminate<br/>Level I.</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II.</p>
<p>7.3.2.1 In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the grievant<br/>may appeal the decision in writing to the Superintendent, or designee, within ten<br/>(10) workdays after the termination of Level I.</p>
<p>7.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This written appeal described herein shall be submitted on a Level II Grievance<br/>Form provided by the District, and shall include a copy of the original grievance,<br/>the decision rendered at Level I, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for<br/>the appeal. Either the grievant or the Superintendent, or designee, may request a<br/>personal conference.</p>
<p>7.3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent, or designee, shall communicate a written decision within ten<br/>(10) workdays after receiving the appeal and such a decision will terminate Level</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III Mediation.</p>
<p>7.4.1 If the Federation or District elects, the grievance may be referred to a mediator from the State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service (SMCS). Both the Federation and the District agree to<br/>participate in the process in good faith in an attempt to reach an equitable resolution.</p>
<p>7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the District or the Federation may contact SMCS for the assignment of the mediator.<br/>A meeting will be scheduled as soon as calendars can be arranged.</p>
<p>7.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Federation and the District agree, they may use an alternative to the SMCS.</p>
<p>7.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of mediation are to be borne equally.</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV Arbitration.</p>
<p>7.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance which is not settled at Level III, and which the Federation desires to contest<br/>further, shall be submitted to arbitration as provided herein, but only if the Federation gives<br/>written notice to the District of its desire to arbitrate the Grievance within ten (10) workdays<br/>after the termination of Level III. It is expressly understood that the only matters, which are<br/>subject to arbitration, are grievances as defined above which were processed and handled<br/>in accordance with the limitations and procedures of this Article. Processing and discussing<br/>the merits of an alleged grievance by the District prior to Level II shall not constitute a waiver<br/>by the District of a defense that the dispute is not grievable. However, District failure to<br/>raise such an arbitrability or grievability issue at Level I shall constitute a waiver of non¬<br/>arbitrability or non-grievability at subsequent levels of this procedure.</p>
<p>7.5.1.1 Upon the mutual and written agreement of the District and the Federation, the<br/>parties may elect to utilize the expedited arbitration procedures of the American<br/>Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of Arbitrator. The District and the Federation agree to request from the State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service an odd numbered panel of arbitrators qualified to render<br/>a decision in the public schools of California. The order of striking shall be determined by<br/>lot. The last name remaining shall serve in accordance with the procedures of SMCS. If<br/>either the District or the Federation wants to reject the entire list before striking, a request<br/>for another panel will be forwarded to SMCS. If for some reason that arbitrator cannot<br/>serve, a new list shall be requested from SMCS and the above process begun again.</p>
<p>7.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion to Dismiss. The District may claim that a grievance should be dismissed because, for<br/>example, it falls outside the scope of the procedure, or was filed in violation of the time limits<br/>provided for herein, or that the dispute has become moot, or that a party has breached the<br/>confidentiality provisions.</p>
<p>7.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations Upon Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change,<br/>add too, or subtract from any of the terms of this Agreement, but shall determine only<br/>whether or not there has been a violation, misapplication, misinterpretation of this<br/>Agreement in the respect alleged in the Grievance. In determining whether the District has<br/>violated an express term of this Agreement, the standard of review for an arbitrator is to be<br/>whether the District acted in an arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory manner. The</p>
<p>decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented<br/>to him by the respective parties in the presence of each other, and upon arguments presented<br/>in briefs.</p>
<p>7.5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement constitutes a contract between the parties which shall be<br/>interpreted and applied by the parties and by the arbitrator in the same manner<br/>as any other contract under the laws of the State of California. The function and<br/>purpose of the arbitrator is to determine disputed interpretation of terms actually<br/>found in the Agreement, or to determine disputed facts upon which the<br/>application of the Agreement depends. The arbitrator shall therefore not have<br/>authority, nor shall he consider it his function, to decide any issue not submitted<br/>or to so interpret or apply the Agreement as to change that which can fairly be<br/>said to have been the intent of the parties as determined by generally accepted<br/>rules of contract construction. Past practice of the parties in interpreting or<br/>applying terms of this Agreement may be considered relevant evidence. The<br/>arbitrator shall not render any decision or award, or fail to render any decision or<br/>award, merely because in his opinion such decision or awards is fair or equitable.</p>
<p>7.5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive beyond the beginning<br/>of the fiscal year prior to the ten (10) day period specified in Level I of the<br/>grievance procedure. The arbitrator shall have no power to render an award on<br/>any grievance occurring before or after the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator may hear and determine only one (1) grievance at a time unless the<br/>District expressly agrees otherwise. However, both parties will in good faith<br/>endeavor to handle in an expeditious and convenient manner cases which involve<br/>the same or similar facts and issues.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitrator's Decision</p>
<p>7.6.1 The decision of the arbitrator within the limits herein prescribed shall be final and binding</p>
<p>on all parties.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenses. All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Federation and<br/>District. Each party shall bear the expenses of the presentation of its own case.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to Meet Time Limits. Time limits hereunder may be lengthened or shortened in any particular<br/>case only by mutual written agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to adjust time limit<br/>problems which occur above Level I as a result of the summer recess.</p>
<p>7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federation Representation. In situations where the Federation has been requested in writing not to<br/>represent the grievant, the District shall not agree to a final resolution of the grievance until the<br/>Federation has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the<br/>opportunity to state its view on the matter.</p>
<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable Released Time. Grievance meetings normally will be scheduled by the District so as not<br/>to conflict with assigned duties. However, if the meeting is expected to be of such duration that it<br/>would extend beyond the normal business hours of the District's Central Office, the District shall<br/>provide released time with no loss of pay to one (1) authorized representative of the Federation so<br/>that the session can be accommodated within such business hours.</p>
<p>7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality. In order to encourage a professional and harmonious disposition of unit members<br/>complaints, it is agreed that from the time a grievance is filed until it is processed through arbitration,<br/>neither the grievant nor the Federation nor the District shall make public either the grievance or<br/>evidence regarding the grievance.</p>
<p>7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Reprisal. There shall be no reprisal against a unit member for filing a grievance or assisting a</p>
<p>grievant in the above procedure.</p>
<p>Page 13</p>
<p>7.13 Grievance Files. The District's records dealing with the filing and processing of a grievance shall be<br/>maintained separately from the grievant's personnel file and the name of the grievant struck from<br/>uses of the materials/records.</p>
<p>Page 14</p>

<p>ARTICLE 9. EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation. The Teacher Assessment and Support Program will serve as the evaluation procedure<br/>for the district’s certificated employees.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change to this program shall be made by mutual agreement of Federation and the District.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and Federation agree to a set of Standards for the Teaching Profession that establish<br/>satisfactory performance for certificated employees.</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards for regular classroom teachers and counselors shall be in six (6) domains,<br/>currently outlined in the OUHSD Standards for the Teaching /Counseling Profession<br/>documents.</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Standards shall apply to Special Education Teachers in two (2) domains.</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards for Psychologists, Nurses, and Library Media Teachers will be established, which<br/>define satisfactory levels of performance in the same format as the Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession. These standards shall be implemented according to the following<br/>schedule: Psychologists and Nurses—SY 2007-08, Speech Therapists—SY 2008-09, Library<br/>and Media Teachers—SY 2009-10.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated staff (including administration) shall be responsible for maintaining Professional<br/>Standards at all times.</p>
<p>9.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As administrators observe in classrooms or work settings, they have the responsibility to<br/>identify any concerns related to the Professional Standards.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-Assessment. Each year, all certificated employees shall conduct a Self-Assessment. The Self-<br/>Assessment shall be in each domain and sub domain of the Continuum of Teacher Abilities. Using<br/>this Continuum, each teacher shall establish goals and objectives focusing on their own performance<br/>for the year.</p>
<p>9.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees shall not be obligated to share their Self-Assessment with anyone.</p>
<p>9.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall sign the Self-Assessment completion form each year, stating they have<br/>completed the self-assessment and their goals and objectives for the year.</p>
<p>9.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of administrators to provide support to teachers with respect to their<br/>goals and objectives.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all certificated unit members with permanent status who have been employed at least 10 years<br/>with the school district, are highly qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec 7801, and whose previous<br/>evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, the evaluation cycle shall be five<br/>years, if the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree. The certificated employee<br/>or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time. These changes encourage focused evaluation<br/>of beginning teachers and are not intended to limit the principal’s ability to observe classroom<br/>instruction and assure quality teaching and maintenance of professional standards. For all others,<br/>the formal, biannual or triennial teacher evaluation program for tenured teachers will consist of<br/>three (3) options. A list of timelines/deadlines, and materials detailing the evaluation process shall<br/>be distributed to all employees. For those teachers electing the Partner Option, the evaluation cycle<br/>shall be three (3) years for the period of time the current waiver is applicable.</p>
<p>9.6.1 Probationary, temporary, emergency, or categorical (non-permanent) employees will be<br/>evaluated annually on the Administrative Option for their first two (2) years. Administrators<br/>shall be responsible, by March of the second year, for certifying that the employee has met<br/>the Professional Standards in each domain applicable to them. Employees unable to meet<br/>each of the standards shall not be granted tenure.</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>9.6.1.1 The evaluation process shall be completed in sufficient time so that each teacher<br/>shall receive his/her evaluation no later than March 15.</p>
<p>9.6.1.2 The evaluator shall make formal observations of not less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>9.7 Assistance. Any permanent teacher identified as performing below the Professional Standards shall<br/>be placed on pre-assistance or assistance. The primary purpose of this program is to improve the<br/>quality of classroom instruction and promote higher student achievement. Article 13: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer</p>
<p>Assistance and Review (PAR) program will be utilized to implement the assistance phase of this<br/>process.</p>
<p>9.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement on Pre-Assistance shall occur prior to placement on Assistance.</p>
<p>9.7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase I. Pre-Assistance. Before a permanent teacher may be placed on Pre-<br/>Assistance, two (2) consecutive observations by the principal or designee of at least<br/>30 minutes in duration shall occur. To be placed on Pre-Assistance, the principal<br/>or designee must find both observations “unsatisfactory.” Placement on pre¬<br/>assistance will coincide with placement in TASP (the administrative mandate<br/>referenced in this Evaluation Article).</p>
<p>9.7.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first “unsatisfactory” observation, a written notice will be<br/>given to the teacher which will include the following information:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the problem, including the Professional Standard<br/>the problem encompasses.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the desired behavior.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date(s) the problem occurred.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date by which the problem is to be resolved.</p>
<p>9.7.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase II—When a teacher is placed in Pre-Assistance, two (2) formal<br/>observations, including a pre and post-conference between the<br/>teacher and the principal or designee will take place. Pre-Assistance<br/>shall be at least ten (10) weeks in length. During this time, the<br/>Evaluating Teacher will be asked to provide input and assistance.<br/>After the Pre-Assistance period, the teacher will either be placed on<br/>Assistance (PAR) if the “unsatisfactory” area has not been corrected as<br/>shown by an “unsatisfactory” evaluation; or returned to the former<br/>evaluation option. If the problem is resolved, then no written record<br/>of the Pre-Assistance shall be placed in the employee's permanent<br/>Personnel File (although one may be preserved and filed if the teacher<br/>is placed on a Pre-Assistance Plan for the second time for the same or<br/>substantially similar problem area).</p>
<p>9.7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase III. Assistance. The duration of Assistance shall be a minimum of 20 weeks.<br/>Teachers on assistance are not eligible for transfer. Assistance includes intensified<br/>observations and conferences between evaluatee and the Evaluating Teacher,<br/>along with specific guidance and support, and a written Assistance Plan. The<br/>Assistance Plan shall include the following, and shall become a part of the<br/>employee's permanent Personnel File.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the problem and existing conditions.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific objectives for the evaluatee.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific methods and resources which the evaluatee will use to remedy the<br/>problem.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific guidance that will be offered to the evaluatee.</p>
<p>9.7.1.2.1 Formal assistance is generally assigned for the entire school year. If,<br/>however, a teacher has corrected noted problems, he/she could be</p>
<p>Page 17</p>
<p>taken off Assistance.</p>
<p>9.7.1.2.2 If a unit member does not agree with placement on an Assistance Plan,<br/>the unit member may request that PAR Panel (Article 13.1.5) review<br/>documentation and make a recommendation for the Superintendent's<br/>consideration.</p>
<p>9.7.1.3 An employee who transfers shall take their evaluation option and cycle with them.</p>
<p>9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of documents associated with this Evaluation Procedure are cited and incorporated. Any<br/>changes in these documents must be done by mutual agreement. Failure of the District to maintain<br/>records cannot result in a certificated employee receiving an off-cycle evaluation.</p>

<p>9.9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Evaluation Documentation File shall include any official observations of an<br/>employee, and any other pertinent information that may be considered for<br/>inclusion in the subsequent evaluation of the employee. If said observation and</p>
<p>other pertinent information are not included in the subsequent evaluation of the<br/>employee, it shall be removed from the Evaluation Documentation File not later<br/>than the end of the school year in which the evaluation takes place, unless the<br/>process set out above in 9.7.1.1.2 has been utilized.</p>

<p>13.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent teachers desiring assistance in improving their teaching may apply for<br/>such assistance on a confidential basis. Participation in the voluntary program<br/>does not preclude placement in the mandatory program. Documentation will not<br/>be placed in the personnel file so long as participation continues on a voluntary<br/>basis.</p>
<p>13.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Teacher Intervention Program - Mandatory</p>
<p>13.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This component shall provide intervention to permanent teachers who receive two<br/>(2) consecutive “unsatisfactory” observations.

<p>13.1.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “unsatisfactory” observation will be based on Article 9.7.1.1 of this<br/>agreement. The observation shall reflect an overall “unsatisfactory<br/>performance as related to the adopted Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession.</p>
<p>13.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Program is to assist and offer remediation to permanent<br/>teachers whose performance has been observed as “unsatisfactory” by the<br/>principal /designee. The prime focus of this Program is to provide assistance to<br/>renew quality teaching.</p>

<p>g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties understand that every possible subject matter<br/>competency may not be available with the district, and therefore<br/>it shall occasionally be necessary to secure additional assistance<br/>to fully address identified deficiencies. In such cases, the<br/>Consulting Teacher shall maintain prime responsibility for<br/>assuring the availability of appropriate resources.</p>
<p>13.1.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of assistance, the permanent teacher's evaluation shall be the<br/>joint responsibility of the Evaluating Teacher and the principal or designee.

<p>ARTICLE 16. SALARIES</p>
<p>16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 2014-15 contract year, the following Unit Share formula shall be employed<br/>to govern annual modifications to unit member compensation and benefits:</p>
<p>Step 1: Determine District revenue from the base grant of the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)<br/>provided that the base portion of the total LCFF grant equals 92.7% of the total LCFF grant. In such<br/>years that the base portion of the grant does not equal 92.7% of the total LCFF grant, the total LCFF<br/>grant shall be multiplied by 92.7 to determine includable revenue for purposes of this Step 1.</p>
<p>Step 2: Multiply the result of Step 1, by the Unit Share of 70%.</p>
<p>Step 3: Subtract all Unit related expenditures from the result of Step 2. ‘Expenditures historically<br/>recognized shall continue to be recognized for purposes of the formula except that Adult Education<br/>certificated expenditures shall be recognized as long as the revenue continues to be embedded in the<br/>base grant. If Adult Education revenue is ever removed from the base grant, the Adult Education<br/>expenditures would no longer be recognized.</p>
<p>Step 4: The result of Step 3 shall be the positive or negative amount of money that shall be allocated<br/>to the bargaining unit.</p>
<p>Step 5: The result of Step 4 shall be divided by the cost of a 1% raise to determine the percentage<br/>increase or decrease to the salary schedule.</p>
<p>2014-15</p>
<p>For 2014-15 only, if the unit share formula does not generate an increase in salaries due to the<br/>increased cost of health and welfare benefits exceeding five (5) percent, the parties agree to work<br/>together to request the transfer of CSEBO reserves to the District in order to produce a mutually<br/>agreeable increase in salary.</p>
<p>For 2014-15 only, $325,000 is allocated to the Federation for distribution to members in the form<br/>of a one- time off- schedule bonus which will be paid in the December 2014 warrant. The amount<br/>payable to each member shall be determined by the Federation, but the total shall not exceed<br/>$325,000.</p>
<p>16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the release of the governor’s January proposed budget, estimated unit share computations<br/>shall be made by the District based upon the format attached. The formula computations shall be<br/>revised following the adoption of the state budget and again by the end of October of the year<br/>immediately following the adoption of the state budget. Teacher warrants starting in November (the<br/>next month) shall reflect any increase or decrease justified by the formula computation.</p>
<p>On or after February 1 each year, each party may request to consult with the other party concerning<br/>the application of the formula for the following year. After a request is made for consultation, unless<br/>mutually agreed otherwise, the District and the Federation shall meet at least twice per month to<br/>discuss options that would alter the application of the formula. Should no agreement be reached by<br/>June 30, the parties agree to mutually request the appointment of a SMCS mediator. If no agreement<br/>has been reached by August 15, the District may implement the formula without modification.</p>
<p>16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for Formula Adjustments. Certificated employees, to be eligible for a Salary Schedule<br/>Adjustment, must have been employed during the school year for which the adjustment is being<br/>made. Employees who worked less than a full year will receive a prorated adjustment based on the<br/>fraction of a full year for which they worked. Employees who were on sabbatical will receive one-<br/>half the adjustment amount if on a full-year sabbatical, and three-fourths the adjustment if on a<br/>one-semester sabbatical.</p>
<p>16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula shall be used to determine, in addition to the salary schedule:</p>
<p>Page 47</p>
<p>16.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District contributions for health, dental, vision, life insurance, and retirement plans for unit<br/>members and eligible retirees.</p>

<p>16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year the District and Federation shall schedule no fewer than four (4) meetings on formula<br/>review and analysis: In August; within two (2) weeks of CBEDS; within three (3) weeks of P-2; and<br/>in June. The meetings shall receive up-to-date information on unit share and calculate the then<br/>current unit share for the budget year.</p>
<p>16.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formula Monitoring. The District agrees to meet monthly with representatives of OFT to<br/>review the current status of the formula. OFF The Federation will present questions to the<br/>District 14 days prior to the meeting. The District will provide answers if they are reasonably<br/>available no later than seven (7) days prior to the meeting.</p>
<p>16.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Unit Share&quot; will constitute the total funds to be allocated to unit compensation which<br/>includes salaries and fringe benefits of unit members, health and welfare benefits for unit<br/>members and retirees, extra duty pay and department chair stipends for unit members,<br/>retirement plans for current and past unit members, or currently provided by the District,<br/>and adjustments from prior year calculations of unit compensation, based upon actual<br/>income and expenditures.</p>
<p>16.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Unit Share&quot; is defined as in 16.1 above.</p>
<p>16.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stipend of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) will be paid three (3) teachers appointed by<br/>the OFT to assist in monitoring the formula. Five hundred dollars ($500.00) of the stipend<br/>will be paid on December 10 and five hundred dollars ($500.00) will be paid May 10.</p>
<p>16.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days for monitoring the formula shall be scheduled by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>16.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dollar amount of the unit share has been determined in each year, it shall be used as follows:</p>
<p>16.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dollar amount of the unit share shall be used for items listed below in order shown until<br/>that amount is exhausted (Items 16.7.2 through 16.7.6).</p>
<p>16.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fund the base salary of all unit members at the rate of the previous year's certificated<br/>salary schedule.</p>
<p>16.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fund the retirement plans and fringe benefit costs for all unit members and eligible<br/>retirees previously in the program.</p>
<p>16.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fund step and column and anniversary increment increases that have occurred since the<br/>previous year.</p>
<p>16.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fund increased fringe benefit costs to maintain current benefit levels and fund retirement<br/>plans for new retirees.</p>
<p>16.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fund a salary increase of up to the current year Consumer Price Index for All Urban<br/>Consumers-Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim-Metropolitan Area, plus any deficit between<br/>on-schedule increases and the CPI during the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>16.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If after applying the dollar amount of the unit share as in 16.7 above there is a balance remaining,<br/>the District shall negotiate with the Federation to determine what portion will be applied to the<br/>following:</p>
<p>16.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund an additional salary schedule increase.</p>
<p>16.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund an improvement in the level of fringe benefits.</p>
<p>Page 48</p>
<p>16.7.3 Fund an improvement in site teacher/counselor staffing ratios. An ultimate goal for<br/>counselor staffing ratio, should adequate funding be available, will be 425 to 1.</p>

<p>16.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each comprehensive high school shall be staffed at a ratio of 27 students to 1 teacher,<br/>exclusive of Special Education and categorically funded programs based upon mutually<br/>agreed upon District-Student Projections for the following year.</p>
<p>16.8.1.1 Staffing will be mutually agreed upon after District and the Federation meets<br/>to review District-Student Projection for the following year.</p>
<p>16.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the comprehensive high school site teacher-staffing ratio rises above 28 to 1, the<br/>District shall add the number of teachers necessary to reduce the site teacher-staffing ratio<br/>below 28 to 1.</p>

<p>16.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculation of ratios in 16.6 and 16.7 shall occur in April of each year during consultation with the<br/>Federation for next year’s staffing using historical CBEDS to P2 holding power, initial site CBEDS<br/>enrollment projections and next year’s projected P2 enrollments based on the above. The District<br/>will not be compelled to reduce staff if the actual number of students causes staffing ratios to fall<br/>below those stated above in the next succeeding year. Should the staffing not be adequate to meet<br/>class size requirements, the contractual class size restrictions are waived for the year.</p>
<p>16.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When and if the state ceases utilizing the Local Control Funding Formula or makes material changes<br/>to it, the parties shall meet to determine what changes to make to the formula.</p>
<p>16.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hourly wages for summer school and adult education teachers shall increase the same percentage<br/>as that applied to the regular unit salary schedule.</p>
<p>16.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra duty pay assignments will increase by the percent applied to the regular unit salary<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>16.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer School Pay. Any percentage increase applied to the Certificated Salary Schedule will apply<br/>to the hourly rate for summer school.

<p>ARTICLE 17. FRINGE BENEFITS</p>
<p>Preamble:</p>
<p>It is the intent of this section to encourage all employees of the OUHSD to achieve eligibility for Medicare<br/>benefits so that when they are retired and have reached Medicare eligibility, in conjunction with a<br/>supplement health policy supplied and paid for by unit share, they and their dependents will have health<br/>insurance coverage for the life of the retired employee.</p>
<p>It is also the intent of this section to have the OUHSD supply and pay for health benefits for an employee<br/>hired prior to July 1,2004 upon his/her retirement and his/her reaching Medicare eligibility, and to his/her<br/>eligible dependents for the life of the retiree when the retiree cannot achieve 40 Medicare quarters by the<br/>age of 55. Thus an employee aged 49 with 18 Medicare quarters, could, if the Medicare division took place<br/>within the next six (6) months, acquire at least 22 additional quarters by the age of 55, whereas an employee<br/>of the same age with 14 quarters could not acquire 40 quarters by age 55. The health plan supplied and<br/>paid for by the OUHSD to this group of employees will be at least equal to the plan supplied to active<br/>employees in the District.</p>
<p>It is also the intention of this section to guarantee health benefits supplied and paid for by the OUHSD to all<br/>retirees hired prior to July 1, 2004 between the ages of 55 and 65 and to their dependents during the life of<br/>the retirees. This health policy shall be the same as that supplied to employees then currently active in the<br/>OUHSD.</p>
<p>It is further understood that an employee to be eligible for any retiree health benefits must have worked a<br/>minimum of 15 years in the OUHSD and be 55 years of age.</p>
<p>For all active unit members:</p>
<p>17.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide a health insurance program through Coastal Schools Employee Benefit<br/>Organization or a like organization.</p>
<p>17.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation and the District shall have equal representation on the CSEBO Executive<br/>Board. The Federation shall have the right to appoint a representative of their choosing.</p>
<p>17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide a dental insurance program (the same program as is in effect at the time<br/>of ratification) through said Coastal Schools Benefit Organization or like organization.</p>
<p>17.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide a Vision Service Plan.</p>
<p>17.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide a mutually agreed upon life insurance program.</p>
<p>17.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall maintain the benefits described in sections 17.1 through 17.4 above, for the<br/>duration of this agreement, unless mutually agreed to revise coverage.</p>
<p>17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless modified in subsequent negotiations for a successor agreement, upon the expiration of this<br/>Agreement the District shall only be obligated to continue contributing the premium amounts then<br/>in force for the fringe benefit coverages described in sections 17.1 through 17.4 above.</p>
<p>17.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare. Upon retirement, current employees hired prior to July 1, 2004 who have reached the<br/>age of 55 with 15 years of District service shall be covered at District expense with the then current<br/>District medical plan for active employees for the retiree and dependents for the lifetime of the<br/>retiree, except as restricted below.</p>
<p>17.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employees 45 or younger, on December 1, 1992, and dependents eligible for District<br/>coverage, will receive the District's supplementary insurance upon retirement and having<br/>reached that age at which Medicare is generally granted to participants (currently age<br/>65). However, it is not necessary for an individual to be eligible for Medicare to receive</p>
<p>Page 51</p>
<p>the District's supplementary package.</p>
<p>17.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees older than 45 on December 1,1992, who could achieve a total of forty quarters<br/>toward Medicare eligibility by age 55 and dependents eligible for District coverage, will<br/>receive only the District's supplementary insurance upon retirement and having reached<br/>that age at which Medicare is generally granted to participants (currently age 65).<br/>However, it is not necessary for an individual to be eligible for Medicare to receive the<br/>District's supplementary package.</p>
<p>17.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District supplementary plan when added to Part A and Part B of Medicare will provide<br/>coverage at least equivalent to the then existing health plan of the District.</p>
<p>17.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may at its option elect to pay from the unit share for an individual's Medicare<br/>Part B or include the payment for Part B medical costs within the supplementary plan.</p>
<p>17.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At hired prior to July 1, 2004, the District may at its option substitute Medicare Parts A<br/>and B and the District supplementary insurance plan for its own then existing District<br/>medical plan as long as this plan it at least equivalent to the plan provided to then active<br/>OUHSD unit members.</p>
<p>17.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Retiree Medical Benefit funding entity is dissolved during the life of this contract, the surplus<br/>after the liabilities are paid will be assigned to all beneficiaries.</p>
<p>17.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a joint Federation/District standing Medical Benefits Committee to monitor and<br/>review Employee Insurance to maximize coverage and minimize cost. Federation shall appoint one<br/>(1) participant from each comprehensive school and the alternative programs. Federation shall also<br/>appoint a representative from the classified and paraeducator unit. The District shall appoint a<br/>maximum of five (5) participants. Representatives shall serve two-year, renewable terms. The chair<br/>of the committee shall rotate annually between Federation and the District. The committee shall be<br/>responsible for making recommendations to the District and Federation regarding health benefits<br/>and overseeing health benefits for active employees, analyzing medical, dental and vision programs.<br/>The representatives or alternatives from the District and Federation to CSEBO or a like organization<br/>shall report to the committee and keep them informed on a regular basis.</p>
<p>17.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that a joint subcommittee of the District and Federation representatives will be<br/>established to explore retirement benefits for employees hired after July 1,2004.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 18. WORKDAY AND WORK YEAR</p>
<p>18.1</p>
<p>18.2</p>
<p>Workday</p>

<p>18.1.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library Media Teachers or any unit member who works in the Library<br/>Media Center at lunch shall be compensated commensurate with home<br/>teaching pay.</p>
<p>18.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of sections 18.1.1.2 above shall only be observed providing the safe entry<br/>and safe dismissal of students have been provided for by unit members during a national<br/>disaster, student unrest, or school emergency.</p>
<p>18.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the basic workday provisions described above, unit members shall be<br/>required to perform one (1) adjunct duty assignment. One (1) adjunct duty assignment<br/>can be a sequence of tasks adding up to approximately 12 allocated hours of duty in<br/>accordance with past practice. If adequate period substituting is available, those not<br/>wishing to perform a particular adjunct duty may satisfy the requirement by substituting<br/>for 12 teaching periods. The District shall make a good faith effort to distribute equitably<br/>the adjunct duty assignments among unit members at a given site and shall give priority<br/>consideration to employee preference for a particular duty.</p>
<p>18.1.3.1 If requested, a Special Education teacher will have all adjunct duties forgiven<br/>for the duration of the contract.</p>
<p>18.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to allow one (1) person at each high school to satisfy his adjunct duty<br/>assignment by service as a Federation building representative.</p>
<p>18.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make a good faith effort to schedule no more than two (2) meetings per<br/>month; one (1) faculty meeting and one (1) department meeting.

<p>18.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall allow for a staff preference vote on changed configurations in<br/>minutes and consider the results of such a vote in conjunction with the school site<br/>council or the leadership team.</p>
<p>18.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifications to the daily annual schedule (including banking minutes, block scheduling,<br/>collaboration, or other changes associated with restructuring) may be implemented only<br/>upon the recommendation of a vote of certificated unit members at the site in question.<br/>This vote shall be conducted in a single day provided that absentee ballots are made<br/>available and include the option of maintaining the current schedule in addition to the<br/>proposed changes. These schedules shall be developed jointly by the site stakeholders.<br/>Modifications shall be ratified by a 2/3 majority of those voting (full-time or part-time,<br/>including those on sabbatical leave.) Voting will take place on site and be monitored by<br/>the principal and Federation representatives.</p>
<p>18.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure equitability, for the STAR testing (4 days) and the administration of the grade<br/>10 CAHSEE (2 days), Federation and the District shall develop a recommended district¬<br/>wide testing schedule and make that schedule available to site administrators and<br/>Federation during consultation at least 3 weeks prior to testing. The loss of prep time for<br/>the affected teachers of the CAHSEE shall be reimbursed by the unit share at the sub-rate<br/>up to the limits of the agreed upon recommended schedule. Any additional loss of prep<br/>time will be paid for by the district. With the exception of the previously mentioned testing,<br/>if the district requires unit members to use their prep period for testing purposes, they<br/>shall be compensated on an hour for hour basis by the member’s selection of either comp<br/>time or pay.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Days. There will be a minimum of seven (7) and a maximum of 12 student minimum<br/>days per year.</p>

<p>18.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back-to-School Day and Open House (The district may require teachers to attend evening<br/>activities).</p>
<p>18.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four (4) discretionary days may be utilized at the District's option under the following<br/>conditions: (a) a maximum of two (2) of the four (4) days (those exceeding the stipulated<br/>seven (7)) may be used for inservice activities, provided the District consults in advance<br/>with the Federation about the in-service activities and also provided said activities do not<br/>last beyond the normal teacher workday; (b) any discretionary minimum days other than<br/>those used for inservice activities shall be teacher minimum days unless the teacher has<br/>an assigned responsibility related to the minimum day activity.</p>
<p>18.4.3.1 A minimum day shall be defined as containing 240 minutes including passing<br/>periods, or whatever number of minutes that may be necessary to comply with<br/>State requirements.</p>
<p>18.4.4 All sites will participate equally in the use of District designated minimum days as allowed<br/>by law.</p>
<p>18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduling. The District agrees to make a good faith effort to notify unit members of their tentative</p>
<p>assignments for the upcoming semester two (2) weeks prior to the close of first semester and by the</p>
<p>last day of second semester.</p>
<p>18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensatory time</p>
<p>18.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensatory time will be given for period substituting at the rate of one (1) period of<br/>release time for each period taught.</p>
<p>18.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than eight (8) days compensatory time may be earned in an academic year.</p>
<p>18.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensatory time will be approved with one (1) week's notice except for the day before<br/>Thanksgiving, Winter Recess, President's Days, and Spring Recess.</p>
<p>18.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher is satisfying his adjunct duty requirements through period substituting, the<br/>teacher must have exhausted his twelve (12) periods of responsibility prior to earning<br/>compensatory time.</p>
<p>18.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the compensatory time program to have all of the mandatory hours within<br/>a period used prior to granting compensatory time. However, it is recognized that in<br/>particular instances it might be impossible and principals may waive the intent when<br/>necessary.</p>
<p>18.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensatory time may be taken in units of five (5) except as approved by the principal<br/>or designee, and normally should be taken no later than the semester after it is<br/>accumulated. If that is not possible, all units of five (5) must be taken by the following<br/>semester. Any fewer than five (5) periods will be carried over to the following semester.</p>
<p>18.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may elect in advance the option of compensatory time or compensation at the<br/>substitute rate.</p>
<p>18.6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors will be allowed to flex their scheduled work time to compensate for time spent<br/>working scheduled or specifically assigned evenings such as Parent nights; and Saturday<br/>assignments such as orientation and registration events. Use of flex time shall be mutually<br/>agreed to with the site principal or designee.</p>

<p>Federation has a responsibility to inform the certificated employee of their contractual<br/>obligations. If after proper notice the certificated employee does not comply with the<br/>provisions of this Article, then the Federation shall notify the District and supply the<br/>District with proof of notice to the unit member. Upon receipt of such notice and proof,<br/>the District shall withhold the service fee from the unit member's salary and submit such<br/>fee to the Federation as provided in 20.3.10 below.</p>
<p>The service fee shall equal an amount not to exceed the standard initiation fee, periodic<br/>dues and general assessments of the Federation and shall be used only for those purposes<br/>permitted by law.</p>
<p>Any certificated employee choosing to challenge the manner in which the chargeable<br/>portion of the service fee has been calculated shall do so according to the Service Fee<br/>Appeal Procedure established by the Federation pursuant to the regulations of the Public<br/>Employment Relations Board.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, any certificated employee who is a member of a religious body<br/>whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially<br/>supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join or pay a service fee.<br/>Flowever, any certificated employee who qualified as a religious objector shall pay an<br/>amount equal to the service fee to one of the three following non-religious, non-labor<br/>organization charitable funds:</p>

<p>A certificated employee paying an amount equal to the service fee to one (1) of the<br/>organizations listed above shall submit proof of such payments each year to the Federation.<br/>If such proof is not submitted in a timely manner, then upon receipt of notice and proof<br/>from the Federation, the District shall implement the provisions of 20.3.3 above.</p>
<p>It is recognized that the Federation, as exclusive representative of all certificated<br/>employees, is required to represent all such employees fairly without regard to Federation<br/>membership or non-membership. However, any employee who holds religious objections<br/>pursuant to 20.3.6 above, who requests the Federation to use the grievance procedure or<br/>arbitration procedure on his or her behalf, shall pay the Federation for such<br/>representation. The Federation shall charge the faculty member for the reasonable cost of<br/>using such procedure.</p>
<p>The Federation agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless the District from attorney's<br/>fees, costs, charges, fees, awards and damages arising out of any matter commenced<br/>against the District due to compliance by the District with its obligations under this article.<br/>The District agrees that in consideration of the Federation's obligation hereunder the<br/>District will notify the Federation in writing of any matter within seven (7) days of service<br/>thereof upon the District. The District and the Federation shall both fully cooperate with<br/>each other on any matter commenced against the District. The Federation may, at its<br/>discretion, determine whether to defend, settle in whole or in part or appeal the matter.</p>

<p>20.3.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds deducted on behalf of the Federation pursuant to this Article will be<br/>remitted to the Federation within five (5) working days of the close of the<br/>preceding pay period, provided the District shall not be responsible for<br/>delays beyond its control.</p>
<p>20.3.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide the Federation with a statement accompanying the<br/>remittance indicated the amount of the deductions during the preceding pay<br/>period and the amount to be remitted to the Federation.</p>

<p>21.1 Additional Gainful Employment Clause</p>
<p>21.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is willing to have a two-level interview process for head coaches. The first<br/>level would include Federation, community, and administrative participation to<br/>recommend the top three (3) candidates to the principal who shall make the final decision<br/>which may include the rejection of all three (3). The principal is to choose the best-<br/>qualified candidate. Best qualified is to be based upon a consideration of what is best for<br/>the academic and athletic program of the District. In-district candidates shall be<br/>interviewed.</p>
<p>21.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-District candidates who are not selected may either receive in writing the reasons for<br/>non-selection or request to meet with the principal to learn why they were not selected.</p>
<p>21.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other positions with the school for which unit members may earn additional income,<br/>the principal shall devise a process by which such positions are assigned equitably, inform<br/>the faculty of the process and advertise the position.</p>
<p>21.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain quality media services for students provided by the Library Media<br/>Center extended hours shall include any hours before or after the school day<br/>and/or during lunch. Certain qualifications are required in order to provide this<br/>quality service. Therefore, the Fibrary Media Teacher shall be considered for<br/>this additional gainful employment. If declined, applicants who hold a Library<br/>Science credential shall be considered.</p>
<p>21.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those instances where there is no one with the Library Science credential<br/>available, other unit members will be considered. The position will be advertised<br/>and interviews will be held on site. The unit member selected will be trained<br/>according to 19.1.2.</p>
<p>21.1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide continuity in the library instructional program, teachers<br/>selected for lunch or extended hours shall serve a one-year term.</p>
<p>21.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Gainful Employment</p>
<p>Selection of hourly candidates shall be according to the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members who are properly credentialed for a position for which they apply<br/>shall be deemed qualified unless they do not meet criteria agreed upon by both the<br/>OUHSD and the Federation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properly credentialed members who apply for any hourly position included shall be<br/>ranked according to the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six (6) points shall be awarded to the candidate if he/she has served in any<br/>position included in this section during the semester prior to the semester for<br/>which the position in question has been applied;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five (5) points shall be awarded to the candidate if he/she has served in any<br/>position included in this section two (2) semesters prior to the semester for<br/>which the position in question has been applied;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four (4) points shall be awarded to the candidate if he/she has served in any<br/>position included in this section three (3) semesters prior to the semester for<br/>which the position in question has been applied;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three (3) points shall be awarded to the candidate if he/she has served in any<br/>position included in this section four (4) semesters prior to the semester for</p>
<p>Page 60</p>
<p>which the position in question has been applied;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two (2) points shall be awarded to the candidate if he/she has served in any<br/>position included in this section five (5) semesters prior to the semester for<br/>which the position in question has been applied;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one (1) point shall be awarded to the candidate if he/she has served in any<br/>position included in this section six (6) semesters prior to the semester for<br/>which the position in question has been applied.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candidate with the lowest point total shall be awarded the position.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless agreed upon by the OUHSD and the Federation, positions shall be awarded<br/>on a semester basis.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case two (2) or more qualified candidates shall have the same point totals,<br/>seniority in the OUHSD shall determine the successful candidate. The candidate<br/>with the greatest amount of service to the OUHSD shall be deemed the successful<br/>candidate.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of point ties after seniority has been applied, a coin flip or other random<br/>selection mechanism agreed upon by all affected candidates shall be employed.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a candidate accepts a position and then fails to fulfill the duties of the position for<br/>the entire semester, the second ranked qualified candidate shall be offered the<br/>position.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptance of a position or partial service in a position shall be deemed sufficient to<br/>earn that candidate the same number of points awarded had he/she served in that<br/>position the entire semester.</p>
<p>9. Points shall be awarded for positions included in this section beginning with the fall,<br/>1995-96 semester.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example follows for a position available during the fall semester.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher A has served in a position during the previous fall semester and has<br/>served 11 years in the OUHSD. Teacher A has a total of five (5) points.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher B has served in a position during the previous spring semester and<br/>has served 15 years in the OUHSD. Teacher B has a total of six (6) points.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher C has served in a position during both of the previous two (2)<br/>semesters and has served 29 years in the OUHSD. Teacher C has a total of 11<br/>points.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher D has served in a position during the previous fall semester and has<br/>served 17 years in OUHSD. Teacher D has a total of five (5) points.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher A and D have the same number of points and are low point leaders<br/>among the teachers who applied for the position. However, Teacher D has<br/>more seniority than Teacher A. Therefore, Teacher D is awarded the position.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Teacher D should refuse the position, then Teacher A would be offered the<br/>position, and upon refusal, the next lowest point total teacher shall be offered<br/>the position.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may concurrently hold more than one (1) position included in this<br/>section only if there were no other qualified candidates who had applied for any of<br/>the positions awarded to said unit member.</p>

<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hourly positions may be subject to in-service training. If a position is subject<br/>to in-service training a person must complete the training prior to eligibility for<br/>payment.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An in-district candidate for a coaching position who meets the minimum<br/>qualifications set out in the posting for the coaching position will be selected. This<br/>process does not require the appointment or the consideration of a coach who has<br/>already been removed from a coaching position with the District. The process does<br/>not prevent the employment of a teacher simultaneous with the teacher's selection<br/>for a coaching position. Head coaches of varsity sports are not responsible for hiring<br/>but are responsible for the provision of input for hiring decisions both for feeder<br/>coaching programs and their own teams. All final decisions on coaching are made<br/>by the school principal in consultation with the Director of Athletics.</p>
<p>A unit member may be removed by the principal from an additional gainful<br/>employment position provided that the principal first provides a written description<br/>of the performance deficiencies and provided an opportunity for improvement if the<br/>performance deficiencies are not of sufficient gravity to seriously affect<br/>performance.

<p>33.11 Workday and Work Year</p>
<p>33.11.1 The workday is to be scheduled as per the Adult School calendar. The work year shall be<br/>established by the Adult School Administration after consultation with Federation.</p>
<p>33.11.1.1 Calendars shall be determined for the following school year no later than<br/>May 31.</p>
<p>33.11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that all calendars for all Adult School programs shall be<br/>negotiated by the District and the Federation. The Adult School year shall<br/>be a minimum of 175 days, excluding summer school.</p>
<p>33.11.1.2.1 The commencement and ending dates for Adult School<br/>calendars (traditional, year-round, and alternative programs)<br/>shall be agreed upon through consultation between Adult<br/>School Administration and Federation.</p>
<p>33.11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult School classes may remain open during winter and spring recess<br/>periods for holding scheduled classes maintained in factories, commercial<br/>enterprises or institutions.</p>
<p>33.11.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a calendar has been adopted for Adult School programs, it cannot be<br/>unilaterally changed except in compliance with agreement.</p>
<p>33.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher work assignment shall end after the end of the class.</p>
<p>33.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall be compensated for any mandatory, required meetings outside the<br/>assigned work hours.</p>
<p>33.11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mileage shall be paid when an employee is required to commute between two (2) sites,<br/>without an intervening time in the schedule of two (2) or more hours.</p>
<p>33.11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-time teacher work year shall consist of 35 weeks at thirty-two (32) hours.</p>
<p>33.11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time employees and those employees working no fewer than 75% of the hours a full¬<br/>time employee works shall have the option of electing a twelve-pay installment plan. The<br/>plan shall calculate the employee's annual entitlement and divide that amount into 12<br/>equal payments. Should it appear that the employee will not actually earn the amount<br/>estimated; the employee agrees to allow the District to recalculate the annual earnings and<br/>make the necessary adjustments either up or down so that the employee will have the final<br/>paycheck adjusted to reflect actual earnings. Should it be determined that this method of<br/>payment is a violation of wage and salary laws, the option shall terminate. Employees paid<br/>less than their actual earnings within a pay period will not be eligible for interest. The<br/>annualized pay process is specifically provided as a voluntary option for the employee.</p>
<p>33.12 Scheduling. The District agrees to make a good faith effort to notify unit members of their</p>
<p>assignments at the earliest possible opportunity. If feasible, the District shall notify teachers of their</p>
<p>tentative teaching schedules 15 calendar days prior to the start of each semester.</p>
<p>33.12.1 When the District determines to cancel a previously scheduled adult education class<br/>session, the site administrator will give the affected unit member a minimum of 12 hours<br/>notice. If the minimum notice is not given, the unit member shall be paid for the class that<br/>was cancelled.</p>
<p>33.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working Conditions. Student aides or other clerical persons shall be available four (4) nights per<br/>week for assisting faculty in clerical duties, copying, etc. provided that sufficient funds are available<br/>as reasonably determined by Adult School Administration.</p>
<p>33.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Layoff or Reduction of Unit Members for Lack of Funds</p>
<p>33.14.1 In the case of current Adult School funded personnel who are not to be renewed due to<br/>lack of work or lack of funds (when more teachers have assignment rights than course<br/>offerings), the following procedures shall apply:</p>
<p>33.14.1.1The principal or designee shall first identify the affected course(s), including<br/>closely related courses in the same subject (i.e., English 1, 2, 3 and 4).</p>
<p>33.14.1.2 The seniority of all personnel teaching the course(s) shall be reviewed.</p>
<p>Page 83</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority is measured by the number of consecutive, uninterrupted<br/>years of service. Time spent on approved unpaid leaves of absence does<br/>not count as time served but does not constitute an interruption of the<br/>&quot;consecutive&quot; service requirement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for a year of seniority, the individual must have satisfactorily<br/>served at least 75% of the weeks for full-time service (24 weeks).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service in both Adult School and categorical programs shall apply.</p>
<p>33.14.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee qualified, according to the criteria of 33.15.1.2 with the least<br/>longevity, shall be released first unless the principal reasonably determines<br/>that the person has needed instructional skills or qualifications, not<br/>possessed by an employee with greater longevity. A seniority list shall be<br/>maintained by the Adult School administration, provided to impacted<br/>employees and Federation prior to layoff pursuant to this Article. Federation<br/>shall be kept informed on the requirements for layoff during regularly<br/>scheduled consultation meetings. It is intended that any unit member who<br/>is credentialed and competent to perform continuing services will be<br/>retained, over more junior employees, even if the continued service is<br/>outside of the current assignment.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be provided notice of layoff no less than ten (10)<br/>calendar days prior to its effective date, and an opportunity to have a<br/>hearing on the matter before the Administrator of Personnel if a hearing<br/>is demanded within five (5) days of notice.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing shall give the employees the right to present evidence and<br/>provide a defense.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Superintendent-Human Resources shall make findings of<br/>fact and render the decision of the District. Should the employee be<br/>reinstated, he or she shall be entitled to back pay for the hours lost.</p>
<p>33.14.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-tenured teachers; Reduction of hours for non-tenured teachers shall be<br/>conducted in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<p>33.15 Staffing</p>
<p>33.15.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the beginning of a term, the Adult School Administration shall prepare a list of<br/>courses to be offered at that site by program. After preparing that list, the Adult School<br/>Administration shall make their assignment to those programs from the eligibility list of<br/>staff members currently teaching at that site. These positions need not be posted.</p>
<p>33.15.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the responsibility of the Adult School Administration to identify<br/>courses, which meet the needs of the various programs offered by Adult<br/>School.</p>
<p>33.15.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult School Administration shall maintain eligibility lists of qualified<br/>employees composed of those employees by credential, seniority, and past<br/>assignments. &quot;Qualified&quot; as used in this sub-section, shall mean that the<br/>applicant has taught the same course or closely related course in the same<br/>subject, possesses the requisite credential, and possesses the needed<br/>instructional skills or qualifications as stated on the job posting. The Adult<br/>School administration shall select from among the qualified applicants to fill<br/>each position.</p>
<p>33.15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first priority for assignment shall be the filling of positions by tenured staff who are<br/>guaranteed a number of hours. The second priority for assignment shall be maximizing<br/>the assignment of those tenured employees who are qualified for benefits. The third<br/>priority for assignment shall be maintaining tenured positions to no fewer than 25% of</p>

<p>APPENDIX J. SIDELETTER (IEP)</p>
<p>Side Letter of Agreement<br/>Between</p>
<p>The Oxnard Union High School District<br/>And the<br/>Oxnard Federation of Teachers<br/>Certificated Bargaining Unit</p>
<p>Due to changes in the INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AMENDMENTS (IDEA)</p>
<p>OF 2004 which modifies the required participation, to the extent appropriate, of a regular<br/>education teacher in the process of the Individual Education Plan (IEP) required for all special<br/>education students, the District and the Federation agree it is necessary to modify the existing<br/>1999 side letter of agreement related to this issue. An analysis of compliance issues conducted by<br/>the District’s counsel, Fagan, Friedman and Fulffost, related to this side-letter revealed a number<br/>of items (items 1-6) in the agreement that exposed the District to liability which the District<br/>would like to correct. The Federation expressed an interest in compensating unit members for<br/>this additional requirement for professional services outside of their contracted duties. This side<br/>addresses the interests of both parties and replaces the previous side-letter dated January 22,</p>
<p>1999.</p>
<p>1. A general education teacher and an administrator will be present for the complete IEP<br/>meeting of every OUITSD student as required members of the IEP team. The general<br/>education teacher may be required to attendjregardless of whether that student is enrolled<br/>in their classes. In compliance with 34 C.F.R. 300.321 (e)(1) and E.C. 54341 (g), a<br/>general education teacher may be excused from this meeting, in whole or in part, under<br/>the following conditions: 1) that both the parent of a child with tire disability, in writing,<br/>and administrator consent after conferring with the teacher; and 2) provided that the<br/>general education teacher submits in writing input into the development of the IEP; or 3)<br/>if the IEP team determines that the attendance of the member is not necessary because the<br/>member’s area of the curriculum or related services is not being modified or discussed in<br/>the meeting. Provided the District gives two business days notice, any and all of the<br/>student’s teachers not attending the IEP meeting will submit, prior to the IEP meeting, a<br/>copy of the student’s current grades and assignments, comments on behavior, work,<br/>effort and participation of the student in class and recommendations for any<br/>accommodations, modifications, supplementary aids or sendees necessary for the student<br/>in their class that they wish the IEP team to consider.</p>
<p>Page 97</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Revision, May 12,2011</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a general education teacher is required to attend an IEP meeting during their<br/>conference period, they may choose to be compensated either by an additional period of<br/>comp time or paid at the traditional hourly substitute comp rate. When the IEP team<br/>meeting is prior to or after-school hours, any unit share member in attendance will be<br/>compensated at an hourly rate calculated at the student contact rate. All compensation<br/>costs are to be borne by the District’s share of the Unit Share.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the parents of a special education student have not stated a preference, the District<br/>will make a good faith effort to equitably distribute the assignment of IEP participation<br/>within the guidelines of 71 Fed.Reg. 46,675 (2006) among the certificated staff. Further,<br/>the District will make a good faith effort to notify a general education teacher of an IEP<br/>meeting in which their attendance is required not less than 24 hours in advance of the<br/>meeting. Likewise, the District will make a good faith effort to notify the general<br/>education teacher of a meeting cancellation within 24 hours prior. When the general<br/>education teacher attends a meeting which is cancelled with five minutes notice or less<br/>before the scheduled meeting, the teacher will be entitled to one hour of compensation<br/>corresponding to the time periods described above.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning May 16,2011, all IEP meetings will be scheduled and conducted according to<br/>the guidelines of this side letter. This agreement replaces the previous side letter of<br/>January 22, 1999.</p>
