<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Insurance. The District shall provide members and their<br/>dependents with medical, dental, vision, paid prescription, life insurance,<br/>psychological services, and other coverage as determined by the<br/>Employer/Member Health and Welfare Review Process (4.10, 4.11) and<br/>agreed to by the parties. Such coverage shall be identified in the “CUSD<br/>Insurance Booklet.” The District shall provide each unit member with<br/>updated inserts when revisions occur. (1994)</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required Health Procedures. The Board shall provide prepaid services<br/>for all required physical examinations, communicable disease tests,<br/>and/or other health procedures. (1988)</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registered Domestic Partners. The District shall provide all benefits,<br/>rights and privileges to registered domestic partners that are provided to<br/>spouses as defined by law. (2008)</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change of Carriers. In the event the Board or the Association proposes to<br/>change insurance carriers, the proposed carrier(s) and their specifications<br/>for coverage shall be submitted to an independent insurance consultant<br/>for evaluation as to comparability of benefits and service to that of the<br/>present carriers. Upon completion of the evaluation the independent<br/>consultant shall provide a copy of the report to the parties to this<br/>Agreement. The Board shall not make the final selection of any carrier of<br/>insurance until after consulting with the Association to determine the<br/>specifications of coverage. The utilization of this process shall result in<br/>no less than maintenance of equivalent benefits.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation While on Leave. A member of the Unit on an unpaid leave<br/>of absence may participate, at the member’s option and at his/her<br/>expense, in any of the health and welfare benefits available to members<br/>of the Unit during the duration of that member’s leave.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation of Surviving Spouse/Domestic Partner/Dependents. In the<br/>event of the death of a member of the Unit, the member’s surviving spouse<br/>or domestic partner and/or dependents shall remain eligible to participate in<br/>any and all health and welfare benefits programs that would have been<br/>available to the member, at the expense of the spouse or domestic partner<br/>and/or dependents. Such coverage shall be at the active member rates.<br/>(2008,2011)</p>
<p>4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premium Costs</p>
<p>4.7.1 The District’s Fund 62 contribution shall be made according to<br/>the Participating Full Time Equivalent (PFTE) formula<br/>contained in Article 4 of the 2004-2007 Agreement, until and</p>
<p>unless the parties negotiate a successor agreement modifying<br/>such formula. (2008)</p>
<p>4.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Participating Full Time Equivalent (PFTE) is defined as all<br/>District employees participating in a District-provided medical<br/>plan (i.e., not employees who subscribe only to dental and/or<br/>vision and/or life insurance coverage.) (2004, 2008, 2013)</p>
<p>4.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PFTE Formula. An original calculation (for 2005-06) was<br/>made by dividing the total amount of the District’s contribution<br/>by the number of PFTEs in the District’s medical plans. This<br/>calculation yielded a PFTE dollar amount contribution to be<br/>made by the District into Fund 62 each year until modified<br/>through a negotiated agreement of the parties. (2008)</p>
<p>4.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-2014</p>
<p>An additional one million dollars ($1,000,000) shall be divided<br/>by the April 1, 2013 snapshot of PFTEs. This increased dollar<br/>amount per PFTE shall be added to the existing dollar amount<br/>per PFTE to create a new base of dollars per PFTE for 2013-<br/>2014, as per the District’s Tentative Agreement with all<br/>employee associations signed on May 7, 2013, which is<br/>attached hereto as Appendix “A”. (2013)</p>
<p>The increased contribution per PFTF equals $1,441.89. (2013)</p>
<p>The District’s total contribution for 2013-2014 equals $11,854<br/>per PFTE. (2013)</p>
<p>In April 2013, the District determined the number of PFTEs to<br/>be 968.063. The District’s contribution to Fund 62 for 2013-<br/>2014 shall be this number of PFTEs multiplied by the new<br/>PFTE dollar contribution (968.063 PFTEs x $11,854 =<br/>$11,475,419). (2013)</p>
<p>4.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will continue to implement an IRC Section 125<br/>program to enable affected members to contribute the premium<br/>out-of-pocket amounts required by this article through pre-tax<br/>dollars. (1998,2008)</p>
<p>4.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage shall have been earned for a full calendar year<br/>(September 1 through August 31) for any member who has been<br/>credited with a full year of paid service. Notwithstanding<br/>Section 3.10, a unit member shall have earned coverage for a<br/>full calendar year (September 1 through August 31 of any<br/>calendar year) if that member has served seventy-five (75%)<br/>percent of the number of days required service for the year in<br/>question. (1994)</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarterly Insurance Reports. The District will provide to the Association<br/>quarterly financial statements regarding the self-funded medical and<br/>dental programs through the Health and Welfare Committee.</p>
<p>4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation by Retirees</p>
<p>4.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A retired former member of the Unit may participate, at his/ her<br/>option and at his/her expense, in those health and welfare<br/>benefits, including rights of conversion, now available to<br/>retirees, as listed in the “CUSD Insurance Benefits'' booklet. Such<br/>premiums may be paid in advance.</p>
<p>4.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the death of a retiree, the surviving spouse or domestic<br/>partner and/or dependents covered at the time of the retiree’s<br/>death shall be eligible to continue participation as stated in<br/>4.9.1. Such participation shall be at the expense of the<br/>surviving spouse or domestic partner or eligible dependents.<br/>(2008)</p>
<p>4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee/Member Health and Welfare Review Process</p>
<p>4.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the Association and the District may meet<br/>quarterly (August, November, February, May) to review all<br/>summary reports for the Health and Welfare benefits program<br/>including fund transfers, reserve levels and non-confidential<br/>expenditures. At each of these meetings, the District shall<br/>notify the Association of all projected transfers out of Fund 62.</p>
<p>4.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and Association representatives may meet jointly with<br/>the insurance broker to review, consider, and discuss the<br/>broker’s proposed rate levels prior to the District establishing the<br/>annual rate levels for the self-insurance plans.</p>

<p>6.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the legitimate, educationally-related/program needs of the<br/>District cannot be met by administratively transferring the least<br/>senior member, the provisions of 6.4.5 shall apply.</p>
<p>6.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of the Unit who are involved in administrative<br/>transfers and the Association shall be informed of the reason(s) of<br/>this action by the Superintendent or designee.

<p>38</p>
<p>consent of the member unless that school is affected by<br/>declining enrollment, in which case that member will be allowed<br/>only those rights of all members.</p>

If such a transfer is to be made during<br/>time when students are not in school, the member shall receive<br/>adjunct duty pay for time spent packing and unpacking. The<br/>adjunct duty pay and substitute time will be determined by<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources. (1992)</p>
<p>Any member so affected by this provision shall be notified in<br/>writing of this available help by the transferring administrator.</p>
<p>(1994)</p>
<p>6.6 Involuntary Transfers Due to Declining Enrollment</p>

<p>6.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff allocation at any site will be determined by the staffing<br/>ratios contained in Article 7.</p>
<p>6.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the educational program needs of the school cannot be met by<br/>transferring the least senior member, exceptions can be made<br/>according to the following procedure:</p>
<p>6.6.3.1 The site administrator will meet with the Faculty<br/>Advisory Committee to discuss the situation. The site<br/>administrator shall present to the Faculty Advisory<br/>Committee and to the teachers involved in the transfer a</p>
<p>written analysis including the status of each member on</p>
<p>each of the following variables:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credential(s)</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major(s)/Minor(s)</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training in special programs</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethnicity</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gender</p>
<p>6.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of the above consultation process the site<br/>administrator shall indicate his/her intent to use the above<br/>factors for transfer rather than seniority. The administrator will<br/>then complete the transfer.</p>
<p>6.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member given an involuntary transfer shall not again be<br/>given a similar transfer for a minimum of four (4) years without<br/>the consent of the member, or unless the member requests a<br/>transfer.

<p>6.6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final placement will be made by the Human Resources<br/>Department in consultation with the principal.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening Schools. In the event that the District decides to reopen a site<br/>which is currently not in use as a school, and/or create a new school in any<br/>other way, the parties shall negotiate procedures for the transfer of<br/>members to the reopened or new school upon written request of either<br/>party. Moving existing staff and student body from one site to another<br/>would not be considered reopening a site or creating a new site. (1992)</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing/Consolidating Schools</p>
<p>6.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to consolidation, Section 6.4.3 will be used to decline the<br/>separate staffs based upon the separate projected enrollments.<br/>Staff allocations for the consolidated school may be adjusted up<br/>to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>6.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No further declining transfers will be made during the first year<br/>of the consolidation unless enrollment declines unexpectedly.</p>
<p>6.8.3 After the procedure in 6.8.3.1 has been completed, assignments<br/>in the consolidated school shall be made according to the<br/>following procedure:</p>
<p>6.8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrator shall poll all staff on assignment<br/>preferences.</p>
<p>6.8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all staff members cannot be placed in their primary<br/>preference, the site administrator shall meet with the<br/>faculty as a whole and solicit input.</p>
<p>6.8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrator shall then present to all staff<br/>members a written analysis using the variables listed in<br/>6.6.3.1. Based on these variables, the site administrator<br/>shall make assignments of all staff members.</p>
<p>6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies, Promotions Posted. The Superintendent or designee shall post<br/>all vacancies, including promotional positions, and new positions as they<br/>occur or as they are anticipated.

The parties may agree in<br/>certain cases to fix a different posting period. During the summer, any<br/>voluntary transfer applicant can call or write the Human Resources<br/>Department, and be given the latest information about vacancies. (1992,<br/>1999, 2008)</p>
<p>6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intra-District Teacher Exchange Program. With consent of the two (2)<br/>principals involved and the Superintendent or designee, any two (2)<br/>members of the Unit in different buildings may choose to exchange<br/>positions. Such request shall be made formally in writing to the Human<br/>Resources Department no later than April 1. (2004)</p>
<p>6.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirmative Action. Should the strict application of these criteria,<br/>District-wide seniority and credentials, violate the federal guidelines<br/>governing affirmative action, or Title 5 of the California Administrative<br/>Code, such criteria shall be applied until such guidelines are satisfied.<br/>Where the lateral movement transfer of a minority teacher would violate<br/>federal or California Guidelines, the Employer shall transfer instead the<br/>least senior non-minority teacher who is credentialed to perform the<br/>required services.</p>
<p>6.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disruptive Transfers</p>
<p>6.12.1 In the event a member is transferred or reassigned from the<br/>regular program to special education or vice versa, or is<br/>transferred or reassigned three (3) grade levels or more from their<br/>present assignment, or is transferred or reassigned from an</p>
<p>elementary school to a middle school or vice versa, the<br/>following provision shall apply.</p>
<p>6.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member shall be given release time from classroom duties if<br/>required. Release time must be approved by the Assistant<br/>Superintendent, Human Resources.</p>
<p>6.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member shall be provided the opportunity to attend District<br/>approved workshops/inservices and/or provided funds to<br/>purchase materials or supplies. Such expenditure must be<br/>approved by the Human Resources Department. The District’s<br/>contribution for this purpose shall not exceed $400 per member.<br/>Cash advances shall be permitted with receipts subsequently<br/>provided to the District.</p>
<p>6.12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member shall be notified in writing of the opportunities<br/>expressed in 6.12.2 and 6.12.3. (1994)</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>Class Size</p>
<p>7.1 School Level Class Size</p>
<p>7.1.1 The number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) members of the<br/>Unit assigned to each school for classroom instruction shall be<br/>done on the basis of the following formula:</p>
<p>7.1.1.1 For the first semester each elementary school shall be<br/>assigned one (1) classroom teacher member of the Unit<br/>for every thirty-one (31) students. This shall be based<br/>on enrollment as of &quot;the ten-day count&quot; (the first ten<br/>[10] student days), and resulting unit member<br/>assignments shall be completed by the end of the<br/>twentieth (20th) student day. (2004, 2008)</p>
<p>Final unit member assignments may be adjusted based<br/>on changes in student enrollment that occur after the ten-<br/>day count but prior to the end of the twentieth (20th)<br/>enrollment day. (2004)</p>
<p>Each middle school shall be assigned one (1) teacher<br/>member of the Unit for every twenty-five (25) students<br/>enrolled as of the end of the first school month.</p>
<p>ELD classes shall be assigned one (1) classroom<br/>teacher member of the Unit for every twenty-five (25)<br/>students enrolled as of the end of the first school<br/>month.</p>
<p>Special Education students carried on a separate class<br/>register shall not be included in this allocation formula.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the intent of this language is as<br/>determined by the 1992 arbitration on class size. (1992,</p>
<p>2004)</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s ability to add additional certificated<br/>staff to any school site in order to avoid situations<br/>that could negatively impact students, programs,<br/>or teachers is permitted by Section 7.1.1.1. (1996)</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association recognizes that there may be<br/>situations in which the staffing ratio as indicated<br/>in 7.1.1.1 may have a negative impact at a<br/>particular school. Therefore, another teacher may<br/>be needed in addition to the ratio expressed in</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>7.1.1.1 to mitigate said deleterious circumstances.<br/>(1996)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to adding additional teachers to a school<br/>site, the District shall inform CEA in writing.<br/>Based upon CEA’s request, the Eluman<br/>Resources Department shall meet with CEA<br/>representatives for purposes of discussion and<br/>consultation. The process and procedure for<br/>determining the need for an additional teacher<br/>shall not be delayed due to the unavailability of<br/>CEA representatives to meet on a timely basis.<br/>(1996)</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention of the District to<br/>indiscriminately assign additional teachers. (1996)</p>
<p>7. E E2 Class Size Reduction Implementation (MOU 1996)</p>
<p>7.1.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree it is<br/>in the best interests of District students<br/>and teachers to participate in the Class<br/>Size Reduction Act (Senate Bill 1777 and<br/>related bills), and to do so in a manner<br/>which minimizes, if not prevents, an<br/>adverse impact on the fiscal health of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>7.1.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Association and District<br/>agree implementation of the Act should be<br/>done in a manner which takes advantage of<br/>the special funding provided under the Act<br/>and which does not endanger other funding<br/>already received by the District and<br/>minimizes the encroachment on the<br/>General Fund.</p>
<p>7.1.1.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above considerations the<br/>parties agree that for the purposes of<br/>implementing the Act, the ratios contained<br/>in Section 7.1.1.1 shall be considered<br/>maximums, thereby allowing the District to<br/>staff at a level which conforms to the Act.</p>
<p>7.1.1.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of Section 7.1.1.1 of the<br/>Agreement provided above extends to any<br/>grade level which is participating in the<br/>Act, beginning with the 1996-97 school</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>year, and continuing thereafter for however<br/>long and to whatever degree participation<br/>continues, whether under “Option 1” (full-<br/>day reduction) or “Option 2” (half-day<br/>reduction).</p>
<p>7.1.1.2.5 The parties acknowledge the Board’s<br/>ability to decide to implement the Class<br/>Size Reduction Program. Upon request of<br/>the Association, the parties shall meet for<br/>consultation (within the meaning of Section<br/>17.15 of the negotiated Agreement) over<br/>whether participation in the Act is/will be<br/>consistent with the manner of participation<br/>described in paragraphs 1 and 2 above,<br/>with the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the</p>
<p>Administration will carry out the Board’s<br/>direction in a timely manner.</p>
<p>7.1.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining fractions of 0.5 FTE or greater shall count<br/>as a full teacher.</p>
<p>7.1.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following members of the Unit shall not be<br/>included as allocations under the formula:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource Specialists</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education Teachers</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Directors</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on Special Assignment</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELD teachers (K-5)</p>
<p>7.1.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes in grades K-8 shall not exceed State mandated<br/>limits. These shall be incorporated into District<br/>regulations.</p>
<p>7.1.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grade 4, 5 or 4-5 combination class reaches a size of<br/>34 students, one-hour of instructional assistant time per<br/>day shall be assigned to the class. If a grade 4, 5 or 4-5<br/>combination class reaches a size of 35 students, two<br/>hours of instructional assistant time per day shall be<br/>assigned to the class. (2004, 2008)</p>
<p>Once instructional assistant time is provided, it shall<br/>continue for the balance of the school year. (2004)</p>

<p>10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III — Arbitration</p>
<p>10.4.1 If the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance at Level II, or the time limits expire without the</p>
<p>issuance of the Superintendent’s written reply, the Association<br/>may submit the grievance to arbitration in accordance with the<br/>provisions of Government Code Section 3543, within twenty (20)<br/>days from the receipt of the Superintendent’s decision or the<br/>expiration of the Level II timeline. In such case, the parties shall<br/>request a list of arbitrators from the American Arbitration<br/>Association in accordance with American Arbitration<br/>Association procedures.</p>
<p>10.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No party in interest shall be permitted to assert any grounds or<br/>evidence before the arbitrator which was not previously disclosed<br/>to the other party. The arbitrator shall consider only those issues<br/>raised by the parties in interest. The arbitrator is empowered to<br/>include in any award such financial reimbursements or other<br/>remedies as judged to be proper. Each party shall bear the full<br/>costs for its representation in the arbitration. The cost of the<br/>arbitration and of the American Arbitration Association shall be<br/>divided equally between the Board and the Association or the<br/>aggrieved if not represented by the Association.</p>

The process of striking names shall<br/>occur within ten (10) days of receipt of the list from the American<br/>Arbitration Association by both parties.

<p>interest.</p>
<p>10.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at Levels I and II of the grievance procedure<br/>will be in writing setting forth the decision and the reasons<br/>therefore and will be transmitted promptly to all parties in<br/>interest and to the President of the Association.

<p>10.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in the judgment of the Association, a grievance affects a<br/>group or class of teachers, the Association may submit such<br/>grievance in writing to the Superintendent directly, and the<br/>processing of such grievance shall commence at Level II.</p>
<p>10.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals,<br/>making reports and recommendations and other necessary<br/>documents will be prepared jointly by the Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee and the Association and given appropriate<br/>distribution.</p>

<p>10.5.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No grievance shall be valid unless it shall have been presented at<br/>Level I or the Level indicated in 10.5.3 within twenty (20) days<br/>after the aggrieved knew of the act or condition and its<br/>aggrieving nature that formed the basis of the grievance, and if<br/>not so presented, the grievance will be considered as waived.</p>
<p>10.5.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision rendered at any level shall be considered final unless<br/>an appeal is registered within the time limit specified. If a decision<br/>is not given to the aggrieved within the time limit, an appeal may<br/>be taken to the next Level.</p>
<p>10.5.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No party in interest shall take reprisals affecting the employ¬<br/>ment status of any member of the Unit, party in interest, and the<br/>Association representative, or any other participant in the<br/>grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>10.5.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive representative shall be allowed two (2) periods of<br/>release time at middle school or 0.4 FTE of release time at<br/>elementary school during each school day for a grievance<br/>representative to process grievances. The Association will<br/>reimburse the District for the cost of one (1) period for a middle<br/>school exclusive representative or 0.2 FTE for an elementary<br/>school exclusive representative. At Level III, the exclusive<br/>representative shall be allowed release time for a grievance<br/>representative to attend all grievance sessions. Should the<br/>processing of any grievance require that the aggrieved be<br/>released from his/her regular assignment, the aggrieved shall be<br/>released without loss of pay or benefits. (2013)</p>
<p>10.5.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any record(s) pertaining to a grievance shall be kept in a<br/>grievance file separate from the aggrieved’s official District<br/>Office personnel file.</p>
<p>10.5.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disclosure meeting between the parties must take place prior to<br/>the arbitration for the purposes of presenting any other grounds<br/>or evidence not previously disclosed. Failure to hold such a<br/>meeting (due to the perceived lack of additional grounds/<br/>evidence) or to present additional grounds/evidence at such a<br/>meeting shall not preclude the assertion of further grounds/</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>evidence at the arbitration so long as the parties comply with<br/>sections 10.4.2 and 10.5.10 above. (1994)</p>

<p>ARTICLE 12<br/>Teaching Hours</p>
<p>12.1 Length of School Year</p>
<p>12.1.1 The number of duty days in the school year for members of the</p>
<p>Unit shall be one hundred eighty-seven (187) duty days which</p>
<p>shall be configured as follows: (1999)</p>
<p>180 Student attendance days</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;August workdays for teacher preparation (12.1.1.2)</p>

<p>1 District Inservice Day: for District-planned activities related to<br/>curriculum (12.1.1.1)</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties intend there to be flexibility regarding the<br/>scheduling of activities during the August Teacher Workdays<br/>and August District Workday. Therefore, the principal, in<br/>consultation with the Faculty Advisory Committee, may<br/>schedule site/District meetings on the August Teacher<br/>Workdays (12.1.1.2) so long as unit members retain the<br/>equivalent of two (2) full workdays for teacher preparation<br/>during the three workdays in August. (12.1.1.1 and 12.1.1.2)<br/>(2002)</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Inservice Day was formerly used to score<br/>District and/or state assessments, but as of the 2001-2002<br/>school year, is no longer used for this purpose. However, if<br/>this need arises in the future, the District will use one of the<br/>Learning Days for this purpose. (2002)</p>
<p>12.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) of the staff development days (the August<br/>District Workday and the District Inservice Day) shall<br/>be planned by the District. (2002)</p>
<p>12.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) of the 187 days before the first student day shall<br/>be for teacher preparation. (1999, 2002)</p>
<p>12.1.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three (3) Staff Development “Buy-Back Days”<br/>listed in 12.1.1 represent implementation of Assembly<br/>Bill 93. (2002,2008)</p>
<p>12.1.1.3.1 If the state eliminates or reduces these days,<br/>the days shall be removed from the teachers’<br/>duty year, and the salary schedule shall be</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>reduced by a .5% per day to reflect such<br/>elimination or reduction.</p>
<p>12.1.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning for such days and the<br/>determination of whether all unit members<br/>shall attend one activity or different<br/>activities, shall be in consultation with the<br/>Faculty Advisory Committee, based on<br/>District recommendations, priorities and<br/>guidelines. (2002, 2004)</p>
<p>Activities planned for and conducted on<br/>these days must comply with all applicable<br/>criteria set forth in state law and regulation.<br/>(2002)</p>
<p>Activities may include but are not limited<br/>to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inservice Presentations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional conferences</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Planning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual planning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level planning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual work time</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Articulation</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program visitations</p>
<p>The foregoing list of activities is by way of<br/>example only, and does not mean that any<br/>faculty or unit member may decide that<br/>they/he/she is/ are entitled to choose among<br/>them. In addition, not all unit members<br/>may need to participate in the same<br/>activities, depending on the relevance and<br/>intent, etc., of the activity. (2004)</p>
<p>A copy of such law and regulation shall be<br/>shared with the Faculty Advisory<br/>Committee prior to the planning of such<br/>days. (2002)</p>
<p>12.1.1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of discretionary leave of absence is<br/>prohibited on these days. Specifically, the<br/>following leaves are prohibited: 5.2.1.3 -<br/>Personal necessity leave for medical and<br/>dental appointments for children, parents,<br/>domestic partner, and spouse unless these</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>12.1.2</p>
<p>12.1.3</p>
<p>12.1.4</p>
<p>12.1.5</p>
<p>appointments are of an emergency nature;<br/>5.2.1.10 - Personal necessity leave for<br/>special childcare and family care needs that<br/>are non-emergency; 5.2.2.1 - Personal<br/>necessity for conducting business of a<br/>personal nature with no questions asked;<br/>and 5.13 - Organizational leave - this shall<br/>not preclude participation in activities<br/>scheduled by California Teachers<br/>Association entities other than the<br/>Association. (2002, 2008)</p>
<p>In addition to the one hundred eighty-seven (187) duty days in</p>
<p>12.1.1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;middle school counselors may be permitted to work<br/>additional days. These additional days will be authorized by the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee. (1999, 2008)</p>
<p>If the District requires nurses to work prior to the start of the<br/>school year in addition to the 187 days provided in section</p>
<p>12.1.1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such work shall be compensated at their regular hourly<br/>rate based on their per diem. (1999)</p>
<p>12.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses shall be allowed to schedule up to ten (10)<br/>workdays per year (between August 1 and June 30)<br/>based on a “flexible schedule.” This means that nurses<br/>may, for example, work on days when students are not<br/>in attendance and not work on days when students are<br/>in attendance (up to a maximum of ten (10) days.)<br/>Nurses are required to plan and coordinate schedules<br/>with approval of the supervisor to ensure that at least<br/>two (2) nurses are present at all times during the 187-<br/>day duty year.</p>
<p>Any new state/federal holidays enacted may necessitate<br/>adjustment to the calendars to maintain the work year (12.1.1).</p>
<p>Additional voluntary staff planning days may be requested by<br/>the site administrator. Such planning days shall be held in the<br/>week following the end of student instruction or in the two (2)<br/>weeks prior to the beginning of student contact time. Such<br/>planning days shall be reimbursed at the adjunct duty pay rate,<br/>or at the request of the unit member, district staff development<br/>credit will be granted. (1994)</p>
<p>12.1.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the voluntary nature of these planning days,<br/>there shall be no adverse consequences to<br/>nonparticipation therein. (1994)</p>
<p>12.2 Duty Week</p>
<p>12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Unit shall not be required to perform duties<br/>(including required meetings) which when combined with the<br/>assigned work day, exceed forty (40) hours of work inclusive of<br/>lunch in any week. The required duty week on site shall be<br/>thirty-six and one quarter (36.25) hours except as provided in<br/>Section 12.2.4. The schedule for the work week shall be set by the<br/>principal or immediate supervisor in consultation with the Faculty<br/>Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>12.2.1.1 Members of the Unit serving as resource teachers<br/>assigned out of the District office shall not be required<br/>to work more than an equivalent duty day as defined<br/>for other unit members (see section 12.2.1). Such<br/>members and their supervisors shall develop a schedule<br/>for the workday. (1999)</p>
<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A duty-free lunch period of no less than thirty (30) minutes per<br/>day shall be provided.</p>
<p>12.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty-free time of twenty (20) minutes a day will be provided to<br/>all teachers except teachers required to supervise students. Each<br/>member of the Unit shall share such duties equally and each<br/>member shall receive a minimum of ten (10) minutes on days<br/>she/he stands duty. Relief time shall be in minimum increments<br/>of ten (10) minutes and shall not be at the beginning of the work<br/>day, tacked on to the lunch period, or at the end of the work day.<br/>If afternoon relief time is provided, it will be scheduled during<br/>the afternoon instructional period provided that period is two (2)<br/>hours or more in length.</p>
<p>12.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Unit shall perform additional duties when<br/>assigned as defined in Article 17.12 within the context of the forty<br/>(40) hour workweek. Such duties shall not exceed twenty-five<br/>(25) hours per school year; however, this shall not be construed as<br/>a minimum requirement. (2002) Members of the Unit serving<br/>on School Site Councils shall accomplish these duties within<br/>the context of the forty (40) hour workweek. In the event that<br/>such additional duties assigned to unit members exceed forty (40)<br/>hours in any one week, appropriate adjustments shall be made<br/>within that week or subsequent weeks. In addition to the<br/>twenty-five (25) hours of adjunct duties, members of the Unit<br/>shall participate in not more than (1) Back-to-School night as<br/>part of their regularly assigned duties. (1996, 2002)</p>
<p>The parties will agree to maintain a list of adjunct duties, the<br/>purpose of which is specifically not to represent an exclusive</p>

<p>ARTICLE 21<br/>Variances - Site-Based Exceptions (1994)</p>
<p>21.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variance Plans—Purpose. It is the objective of the Association and<br/>District to encourage initiative and innovation at the work site through site-<br/>based decision-making. To promote and achieve this objective, the parties<br/>recognize that proposals may be generated which conflict with the<br/>negotiated Agreement. In the event of such a conflict, a variance may be<br/>warranted. The following variance process is intended to provide the<br/>necessary flexibility for site-based decision-making and at the same time<br/>protect the integrity of the negotiated Agreement.</p>
<p>21.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variance Procedure</p>
<p>21.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a faculty member (including site administrators) or<br/>group of faculty members at a school wish to establish an<br/>instructional/work program or schedule that varies from the<br/>negotiated Agreement, such variance plan shall initially be<br/>discussed with the principal. Thereafter, consideration of the plan<br/>will be initiated by petition, signed by at least twenty-five (25%)<br/>percent of the faculty members at the site, including members of<br/>“special groups“ assigned to the site (e.g., special education and<br/>counselors), and submitted to the Association President and the<br/>District Superintendent or designee. The petition must clearly<br/>identify which provisions of the Agreement are affected by the<br/>variance plan, proposed date of implementation, and duration of<br/>the plan.</p>
<p>21.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon attainment of twenty-five (25%) percent of the signatures<br/>as provided above, a secret ballot shall be conducted by the<br/>Faculty Advisory Committee and the principal at the site. The<br/>variance plan must receive the support of at least two-thirds (66<br/>2/3%) of the votes cast by faculty members assigned to the site.</p>
<p>21.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon attainment of the required vote as provided above, the<br/>variance plan shall be submitted in writing to the association<br/>president and the District Superintendent or designee for each<br/>party’s consideration.</p>
<p>21.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon approval of the variance plan by both parties, the plan will<br/>be implemented according to its provisions.</p>
<p>21.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewal and Recession of Plan. A variance plan may be renewed or<br/>rescinded by following the procedure in section 21.2.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 22<br/>Duration</p>
<p>22.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement shall be in effect through 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and<br/>2014-2015. (2013)</p>
<p>22.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to reopen articles as follows (2013):</p>

<p>22.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2013-2014, the parties agree to reopen Article 9, Article 12,<br/>Article 20 and one other article for each party. Article 3 and<br/>Article 4 are closed for 2013-2014. (2013)</p>
<p>22.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2014-2015, the parties agree to reopen Article 3, Article 4,<br/>and two other articles for each party. (2013)</p>
<p>22.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other articles may be opened by mutual consent. (2011)</p>
<p>22.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals shall be “sunshined” (presented for public review) at the first<br/>regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Education following the<br/>exchange of proposals. Negotiations shall commence within seven (7) days<br/>of completion of the sunshine requirements.</p>
<p>22.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second year of the contract, the parties agree to reopen<br/>negotiations on a successor agreement pursuant to Article 15 herein. (2011)</p>
<p>22.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the second year of the contract, reopeners on negotiations may<br/>occur if necessitated by changes in the law which mandate changes in the<br/>contract. (2011)</p>
<p>22.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Witness Whereof, the Cupertino Education Association has caused this<br/>Agreement to be signed by its President, and the Cupertino Union School<br/>District has caused this Agreement to be signed by its President attested by<br/>its Clerk.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 24<br/>Americans With Disabilities (ADA) Provision</p>
<p>24.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association acknowledge that both parties have the<br/>legal obligation to consider reasonable accommodation for qualified<br/>disabled members.</p>
<p>24.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District determines that it must reasonably accommodate a qualified<br/>disabled member, that legal obligation may supersede those sections of this<br/>agreement in conflict with the duty to accommodate.</p>
<p>24.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association recognizes that the District has the legal obligation to meet<br/>with qualified disabled members to discuss reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p>24.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member seeking accommodation has the right to representation by<br/>the Association in discussions with the District regarding such<br/>accommodation. Upon such a request, arrangements shall be made for a<br/>representative to be present before discussion continues.</p>
<p>24.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following discussion with the unit member (and his/her representative if<br/>requested), if the District determines that implementation of the reasonable<br/>accommodation will conflict with the rights of other members or with<br/>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and the parties<br/>(including the Association) have not already consented to the<br/>accommodations offered by the District, the District will give the<br/>Association written notice and an opportunity to meet to discuss<br/>alternatives before implementation of said accommodations.</p>
<p>24.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If after discussions the Association disputes the necessity for or<br/>appropriateness of the reasonable accommodation, the District will<br/>require the unit member to undergo an independent medical examination.<br/>In such case, the medical examiner shall determine, in his/her professional<br/>opinion:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether in fact a disability exists within the meaning of the ADA, and<br/>if so,</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether the proposed accommodation will allow the disabled unit<br/>member to perform the essential job functions.</p>
<p>24.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the examination referred to above answers questions (a) and (b) in the<br/>affirmative, and the Association continues to dispute the necessity for or<br/>the appropriateness of the reasonable accommodation, at the<br/>Association’s request, a conference will be held with the Superintendent,<br/>attended by Association representatives, the unit member (and/or<br/>representative), and a representative from the Human Resources<br/>Department. The Superintendent’s decision regarding the reasonable</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>accommodation shall be final. The Association agrees to keep medical<br/>information related to the reason for the reasonable accommodation<br/>confidential, unless the affected member signs a release.</p>
<p>24.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association acknowledge that particular<br/>accommodations are intended to meet the individual needs of particular<br/>persons. Acceptance by the District and the Association of a particular<br/>accommodation shall not obligate either of them to accept the same and<br/>similar accommodation for a different individual.</p>
<p>24.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any reasonable accommodation provided under the ADA shall not<br/>establish a past practice, nor shall it be cited or used as evidence of a past<br/>practice in the grievance/arbitration procedure. Any action taken to<br/>provide an accommodation pursuant to the ADA shall not be subject to<br/>challenge through Article 10 (Grievance Procedure), however disputes<br/>regarding the use of the procedure herein shall be subject to Article 10<br/>provided that an arbitrator shall have not authority to change or otherwise<br/>affect the accommodation made for the member.</p>
<p>24.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this Article/Section, “member” or “unit member”<br/>includes current unit members, members from other bargaining units<br/>whose reasonable accommodation involves assignment to a position in<br/>this bargaining unit, and new members whose employment in the<br/>bargaining unit will involve reasonable accommodation.</p>

<p>Memorandum of Understanding<br/>Between Cupertino Union School District<br/>And Cupertino Education Association</p>
<p>Extra Periods and Exceptions to Contractual Prep Time at Middle Schools</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra Periods</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school principals may elect to establish “zero periods” at their<br/>schools, either within or outside the regular teacher workday. If the zero<br/>period falls outside the regular workday, affected Unit member’s salaries<br/>shall be increased in proportion to their regular salaries.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher participation in such zero periods shall be strictly voluntary. The<br/>most senior qualified voluntccr(s) shall have first entitlement to such<br/>assignment(s). If extra periods are offered in subsequent years, a rotation<br/>system shall apply, in which the most senior qualified volunteers) who<br/>have not already taught an extra period shall have first entitlement to such<br/>assignment(s).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra periods shall either be within the school’s established staffing<br/>allocation (ratio) or funded through nongeneral fund sources.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the voluntary nature of participation in zero periods, there shall be<br/>no adverse consequence to nonparticipation therein.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the District’s intent to make every reasonable effort to meet the<br/>instructional and/or scheduling and/or facilities needs of middle schools in<br/>a manner which obviates the necessity for extra periods.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing shall be construed to enable to allow Unit members to teach<br/>classes during their contractually provided preparation time; rather, that<br/>potential situation is covered exclusively by Part II, Exceptions to<br/>Contractual Prep Time at Middle Schools.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions to Contractual Prep Time at Middle Schools</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of this Memorandum of Understanding reflects the sole, agreed-<br/>upon conditions under which a Unit member may be allowed to teach<br/>during the prep period set forth in section 12.2.5 of the negotiated<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties acknowledge that constantly evolving staffing and scheduling<br/>needs sometimes result in the need for the District to ask teachers to teach<br/>an instructional period in addition to their regular assignment (i.e., during<br/>their contractually provided preparation period).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching during one’s preparation period shall be strictly voluntary. The<br/>most senior qualified volunteers) shall have first entitlement to such<br/>assignment(s). If such assignments) are offered in subsequent years, a<br/>rotation system shall apply, in which the most senior qualified volunteer(s)<br/>who have not already taught during their preparation period shall have first<br/>entitlement to such assignments).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who teach during their preparation period shall have their salaries<br/>increased in proportion to their regular salaries.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the voluntary nature of teaching during the preparation period, there<br/>shall be no adverse consequence to nonparticipation therein.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the District’s intent to make every reasonable effort to meet the<br/>instructional and/or scheduling needs of middle schools in a manner which<br/>obviates the necessity for utilizing the “exception” provided herein.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall continue to pursue ways to meet its instructional and/or<br/>scheduling needs even after an “exception” has been implemented. The<br/>exception will be discontinued if such efforts are successful and a change<br/>can be made without unreasonably disrupting the education process.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide reasonable notice to Cupertino Education<br/>Association (CEA) during the staffing process to allow the Association to<br/>offer input, options, and advice regarding the potential need for an<br/>“exception” as provided herein.</p>
<p>III. General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any alleged violations, and/or misinterpretations, and/or misapplications of<br/>this Memorandum of Understanding shall be resolved pursuant to Article<br/>10, Grievance Procedure, of the 1998-2001 negotiated Agreement between<br/>the parties.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Memorandum of Understanding is effective for the duration of the<br/>2004-2005 through 2006-2007 agreement. However, both parties agree<br/>that renewal of this Memorandum of Understanding shall not be<br/>unreasonably withheld and that opposition to such renewal shall be based<br/>on objective data based on the implementation of this Memorandum of<br/>Understanding.</p>

<p>Appendix H</p>
<p>Education Code 49079 - Student Discipline Notification</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school district shall inform the teacher of each pupil who engaged in, or<br/>is reasonably suspected to have engaged in, any of the acts described in any<br/>of the subdivisions, except subdivision (h), of Section 48900 or in Section<br/>48900.2, 48900.3, 48900.4, or 48900.7 that the pupil engaged in, or is<br/>reasonably suspected to have engaged in, those acts. The district shall<br/>provide the information to the teacher based upon any records that the<br/>district maintains in its ordinary course of business, or receives from a law<br/>enforcement agency, regarding a pupil described in this section.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school district, or school district officer or employee, is not civilly or<br/>criminally liable for providing information under this section unless it is<br/>proven that the information was false and that the district or district officer<br/>or employee knew or should have known that the information was false, or<br/>the information was provided with a reckless disregard for its truth or<br/>falsity.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer or employee of a school district who knowingly fails to provide<br/>information about a pupil who has engaged in, or who is reasonably<br/>suspected to have engaged in, the acts referred to in subdivision (a) is guilty<br/>of a misdemeanor, which is punishable by confinement in the county jail for<br/>a period not to exceed six months, or by a fine not to exceed one thousand<br/>dollars ($1,000), or both.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 1994-95 school year, the information provided shall be from the<br/>previous two school years. For the 1996-97 school year and each school<br/>year thereafter, the information provided shall be from the previous three<br/>school years.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any information received by a teacher pursuant to this section shall be<br/>received in confidence for the limited purpose for which it was provided<br/>and shall not be further disseminated by the teacher.</p>
<p>Education Code 48910 - Student Suspension by Teacher</p>
<p>(a) A teacher may suspend any pupil from class, for any of the acts enumerated<br/>in Section 48900, for the day of the suspension and the day following. The<br/>teacher shall immediately report the suspension to the principal of the<br/>school and send the pupil to the principal or the designee of the principal for<br/>appropriate action. If that action requires the continued presence of the<br/>pupil at the school site, the pupil shall be under appropriate supervision, as<br/>defined in policies and related regulations adopted by the governing board<br/>of the school district. As soon as possible, the teacher shall ask the parent<br/>or guardian of the pupil to attend a parent-teacher conference regarding the</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>suspension. If practicable, a school counselor or a school psychologist may<br/>attend the conference. A school administrator shall attend the conference if<br/>the teacher or the parent or guardian so requests. The pupil shall not be<br/>returned to the class from which he or she was suspended, during the period<br/>of the suspension, without the concurrence of the teacher of the class and<br/>the principal.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pupil suspended from a class shall not be placed in another regular class<br/>during the period of suspension. However, if the pupil is assigned to more<br/>than one class per day this subdivision shall apply only to other regular<br/>classes scheduled at the same time as the class from which the pupil was<br/>suspended.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may also refer a pupil, for any of the acts enumerated in Section<br/>48900, to the principal or the designee of the principal for consideration of a<br/>suspension from the school.</p>
