<p>ARTICLE E: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE<br/>Section 1: Definitions</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is an allegation by a grievant that there has been a violation, misapplication,<br/>or misinterpretation of the specific provisions of the Agreement, written Board policies, or<br/>State or Federal law directly affecting matters within the scope of representation, as<br/>defined in Section 3543.2 of the Government Code or by P.E.R.B. decisions.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; may be any bargaining unit employee covered by the terms of this<br/>Agreement or the Association on behalf of one or more unit employees with their written<br/>consent.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this section, a &quot;day&quot; is any day when the grievant is regularly<br/>scheduled for work.</p>
<p>Section 2: Filings</p>
<p>No grievance may be filed unless it is filed within twenty (20) days following the act or occurrence<br/>upon which the alleged grievance is based or within twenty (20) days from the date the bargaining unit<br/>employee should have known of the act or occurrence. Failure to file the grievance within the time limits<br/>shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.</p>
<p>All time limits in this procedure may be extended by mutual written agreement. In the absence of<br/>such an agreement, failure by the grievant to meet the time requirements shall constitute a waiver of the<br/>grievance; failure by the District to meet the time requirements permits the grievant to proceed to the<br/>next level.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Agreement shall limit the right of any bargaining unit employee to present a<br/>grievance and have such grievance adjusted without the intervention of the Association at any Level<br/>below the Level of binding arbitration as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with terms of this<br/>Agreement; the District shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the Association has received<br/>a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given an opportunity to file a<br/>response.</p>
<p>Section 3: Timelines</p>
<p>The Association representatives, not to exceed two (2), will receive time off from duties for the<br/>processing of grievances for bargaining unit employees, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 1, the Association president will designate, in writing, to the Superintendent<br/>one (1) bargaining unit employee from each school site who is to receive the time off, as<br/>well as designate the Association's grievance chairperson.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four (24) hours prior to release from duties for grievance processing, the<br/>designated representative shall inform the immediate supervisor in order that a substitute<br/>may be obtained, if necessary.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That such time off shall include representing a grievant in a conference with a<br/>management person.</p>
<p>[-6-]</p>
<p>INFORMAL LEVEL</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant may attempt to resolve the grievance</p>
<p>by an informal conference with the grievant’s immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>FORMAL LEVEL</p>
<p>Level I: (Appendix A: 1)</p>
<p>Within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of the alleged act or omission, giving rise to the</p>
<p>grievance, the grievant must present such grievance, in writing, on the appropriate form to the immediate</p>
<p>supervisor. This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the decision rendered at</p>
<p>the informal conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall communicate a decision to the bargaining unit employee, in writing, within</p>
<p>ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does not respond within the time limits, the</p>
<p>grievant may appeal to the next Level. Within the above time limits, either party may request a personal</p>
<p>conference with the other party.</p>
<p>Level II: (Appendix A: 2)</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the grievant may appeal the</p>
<p>decision, on the appropriate form, to the Superintendent or designee within ten (10) days. This</p>
<p>statement should include a copy of the original grievance, the decision rendered, and a clear, concise</p>
<p>statement of the reasons for the appeal.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall communicate a decision within ten (10) days after receiving</p>
<p>the appeal. Either the grievant, or the Superintendent or designee, may request a personal conference</p>
<p>within the above time limits. If the Superintendent or designee does not respond within the time limits,</p>
<p>the grievant may appeal to the next Level.</p>
<p>Level III: (Appendix A: 3)</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, the grievant may appeal the</p>
<p>decision, in writing, within ten (10) days to the Board of Education. This statement should include copies</p>
<p>of Levels I and II grievances and their replies and any other information pertinent to the grievance. The</p>
<p>administration shall place the matter on the next available agenda. The Morongo Teachers Association</p>
<p>Grievance Chairperson may be present for the presentation of the grievance to the Board of Education.</p>
<p>Should the Board of Education decide not to review the decision, the grievant shall be notified within five</p>
<p>(5) days following the Board of Education meeting at which the grievance was received.</p>
<p>Should the Board of Education review the decision, this must be done and the decision</p>
<p>communicated within twenty (20) days following the Board of Education meeting at which the grievance</p>
<p>was received. It is important to note that a Board of Education meeting must deal with issues as a Board</p>
<p>in total, not as individuals, and are subject to time, public notification, and other legal requirements.</p>
<p>Level IV: (Appendix A: 4)</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is dissatisfied with the results of the preceding Level, or if the Board of</p>
<p>Education decides not to review, the Association may submit the matter to arbitration by filing a written</p>
<p>[-7-]</p>
<p>request. The request for arbitration must be submitted no later than five (5) days after the Association’s<br/>Executive Board’s next scheduled meeting following the Level III decision of the Board of Education.</p>
<p>If the parties are unable to mutually agree upon the arbitrator, they shall, within ten (10) days of<br/>the receipt of the request, ask the American Arbitration Association to submit a panel of seven (7)<br/>names. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list until one (1) remains, which shall be the<br/>arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be immediately notified of selection and set a hearing date mutually<br/>agreeable to the arbitrator and the parties. The arbitrator shall limit decisions to the specific issues<br/>submitted to the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall not have authority to alter, amend, add to, or subtract<br/>from the specific provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding.</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties, one-half (1/2) by<br/>the District and one-half (1/2) by the Association. The party incurring them shall pay any other costs or<br/>expenses.</p>
<p>In the event the Association elects to go to arbitration under this Agreement, this election shall<br/>constitute a clear election of remedies and a specific waiver of any administrative remedy, except for a<br/>grievance that may be reviewed by the Public Employees Relations Board under Section 3541.5(a) of<br/>the Government Code.</p>
<p>Section 4: Miscellaneous</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit employee shall have the right to be represented at all Levels of the<br/>grievance procedures by the Association, including the personal conference.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance arises as a result of action by a representative of the District management<br/>above the level of the bargaining employee’s immediate supervisor, the grievant may<br/>begin the process at the next appropriate level above that of the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All decisions shall be in writing and delivered to the grievant by certified mail, return<br/>receipt requested. Copies of the grievance, as well as decisions, shall be forwarded to the<br/>Association at the same time as they are forwarded to the grievant.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party has the option to postpone processing of a grievance during vacation periods.<br/>Time limits for appeal shall begin the day following receipt of the written decision by the<br/>grievant.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents, communications and records dealing with processing of a grievance will be<br/>maintained in a separate grievance file. This is not intended to preclude the fact that<br/>duplicate or evidentiary matter may also be located in the bargaining unit employee's<br/>personnel file subject to provisions of Article M, relating to Personnel Files.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Files: If a grievance is resolved in favor of the grievant, there will be no record of the<br/>grievance kept in the grievant's personnel file and all materials relating to the grievance<br/>will be destroyed, except that which is maintained as part of the District's grievance<br/>procedures.</p>

<p>bargaining unit employees shall be entitled to twenty (20) consecutive minutes duty-free at an</p>
<p>approximate midpoint of the teaching day.</p>
<p>Section 2: Safe and Healthy Working Conditions</p>
<p>Bargaining unit employees will not be required to work in physical plants which have been judged</p>
<p>by the Board of Education, or safety and health committee, to be unsafe or unhealthful, nor to perform in</p>
<p>such plants unless the safety and health factors creating such conditions is a short duration emergency</p>
<p>[-9-]</p>
<p>situation caused by an act of God, or other unforeseeable circumstances.</p>
<p>Each school site shall have a safety and health committee, comprised of two (2) bargaining unit<br/>employees appointed by the Association, one (1) site administrator and one (1) representative appointed<br/>by the District management. The committee shall hear bargaining unit employee complaints regarding<br/>unsafe or unhealthful conditions.</p>
<p>The committee shall draft proposed recommendations designed to solve the problem. These<br/>recommendations shall be submitted to the complaining bargaining unit employee, the site administrator<br/>and the Superintendent or his/her designee. The Superintendent or his/her designee will review and<br/>acknowledge these recommendations.</p>
<p>Of those recommendations judged unsafe or unhealthful, action will be taken to correct the<br/>condition immediately or within twenty-four (24) hours.</p>
<p>During snowy or icy conditions, custodial and maintenance staff will make a concerted effort to<br/>keep the walkways free of snow or ice, or in as reasonably safe condition as possible.</p>
<p>The school will make arrangements for security contact for those activities when security<br/>personnel are not employed.</p>
<p>At school events where large numbers of non-students are expected and risk of confrontation<br/>exists, security personnel and an administrator will be scheduled for the purpose of assisting, supporting<br/>and protecting on-duty bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p>Section 3: Classroom Interruptions</p>
<p>Bargaining unit employees shall be given twenty-four (24) hours' notice prior to classroom<br/>interruptions for maintenance and/or construction unless written approval by the bargaining unit<br/>employee has been secured. (A work order by a bargaining unit employee requesting immediate action<br/>should be given consideration as negating a twenty-four [24]-hour advance notice.) Whenever possible,<br/>major maintenance shall not take place during the school day if it is going to disrupt teaching and<br/>learning. Whenever possible, each school site will minimize non-maintenance classroom interruptions.<br/>Section 4: Conference Periods</p>
<p>a) Junior and senior high school teachers will normally have one period per day set aside for<br/>preparation, planning and to conference with parents and pupil.</p>
<p>When there is no substitute available, the principal may assign a bargaining unit employee<br/>during that person's conference period to substitute for a bargaining unit employee who is<br/>absent. The bargaining unit employee who substitutes during a preparation period shall<br/>receive the established hourly rate. (See Memorandum of Understanding)(See Article J,<br/>Adjunct Duties)</p>
<p>When secondary teachers are assigned a regularly scheduled class on an ongoing daily<br/>basis, for a period of a semester or more during their conference period, the bargaining<br/>unit employee will be compensated at the rate of one-fifth (1/5th) of the bargaining unit<br/>employee's daily rate.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the elementary level, full-session regular classroom bargaining unit employees will be<br/>provided release time for preparations or conference periods. Preparation or conference<br/>periods will take place for a minimum of one hundred (100) continuous minutes or two (2)<br/>fifty (50) continuous minutes weekly for a minimum of one hundred (100) minutes weekly<br/>as established by the District during the school day and on the school site.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education bargaining unit employees and Elementary Preparation bargaining unit<br/>employees shall schedule the equivalent of one hundred (100) minutes weekly with their<br/>site administrators for preparation or conference period.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following terms and conditions shall apply regarding conference periods and class<br/>coverage for elementary teachers when substitutes are unavailable:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special education teachers will not be used to cover classes for elementary<br/>teachers. Substitutes will be arranged for absent Special Day Class teachers.<br/>When a Resource Specialist is absent and no substitute is available, an<br/>administrator may cover the class using the instructional assistant under the direct<br/>supervision of the administrator and/or by having students remain in their regular<br/>classroom. Prior to using the instructional assistant to cover for an absent<br/>resource teacher who is under the direct supervision of the administrator, an<br/>agreement to do so will have been arranged among the resource teacher,<br/>administrator, and instructional assistant.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten teachers will be assigned specific days and times for their<br/>conference period, either one (1) one hundred (100) minute period per week or<br/>two (2) fifty (50) minute periods per week.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of elementary teachers to cover classes during their conference periods will<br/>be implemented on a voluntary basis. A list of volunteers will be kept in the office<br/>and equitable assignments will be made from the volunteer list. When no<br/>volunteers are available, regular classroom teachers may be assigned to cover<br/>classes for elementary teachers during their assigned conference periods. Such<br/>non-volunteer assignments will also be made from a duty roster that ensures fair<br/>and equitable assignments. A scheduled parental meeting is grounds for a<br/>teacher to decline such assignment. Regular classroom teachers who cover<br/>classes during their assigned preparation period will be paid at the established<br/>hourly rate. (See Memorandum of Understanding)(See Article J, Adjunct Duties)</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary preparation teachers will not have their classes cancelled to cover<br/>regular classes. If the elementary preparation teacher is absent and a substitute<br/>cannot be obtained, the site administrator may cover the class with a teacher on<br/>preparation time and/or cancel the classes and schedule a make-up day when a<br/>substitute is available.</p>
<p>Regarding rates of pay, when bargaining unit employees who are regular classroom teachers (at<br/>the secondary level, this also includes special day class and resource teachers) are required to cover<br/>classes during their conference period, when substitutes are not available, the bargaining unit employee<br/>shall be compensated at the established hourly rate as set forth in Article J.</p>

<p>When the Board is contemplating layoffs, in accordance with Education Code Section 44955, the<br/>Association will be notified of such intention when the Board first considers the matter.</p>
<p>Section 6: Medication</p>
<p>No bargaining unit employee shall be obligated to administer medication needed by students<br/>except for nurses and special education teachers where said activity is specifically noted within the<br/>bargaining unit member’s job description.</p>
<p>Section 7: Pupil Discipline</p>
<p>When it is the judgment of a bargaining unit employee that the continued presence in class of a<br/>pupil represents a physical danger to the bargaining unit employee or other students, the bargaining unit<br/>employee may institute proceedings for consideration of the pupil’s suspension and expulsion from<br/>school.</p>
<p>The District shall provide in service training on grounds for expulsion, and how to document<br/>classroom disciplinary matters. When a case is recommended for expulsion, the District will present the<br/>case or, if the case is not presented, the reasons will be forwarded to the site administrator who will then<br/>relay them to the bargaining unit employee(s) involved.</p>
<p>A written description of rights and duties of bargaining unit employees with respect to student<br/>discipline, including the rights and duties of suspended students shall be presented to each bargaining<br/>unit employee before the first day of school.</p>
<p>Each site shall develop a written policy including, but not limited to the following areas:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards of expected student&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behavior,</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling of referrals,</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling of suspensions,</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for referrals to the Board for expulsion</p>
<p>All discipline referrals shall be handled promptly and according to the aforementioned policy. The<br/>bargaining unit employee who initiates the discipline referral may request and will receive a conference<br/>within five (5) working days with the site administrator or designee to discuss any questions or concerns<br/>regarding the disposition of the referral.</p>
<p>Section 8: Student Placement</p>
<p>When a student is placed in a classroom for disciplinary reasons, the receiving bargaining unit<br/>employee will have a formal conference with the principal or administrative designee prior to the<br/>placement.</p>

<p>The District shall not normally hire any bargaining unit employee as a substitute teacher except in<br/>emergency circumstances when the District is unable to obtain sufficient substitute teachers. However,<br/>the District may, for recruitment purposes, utilize a new bargaining unit employee as a substitute until<br/>that bargaining unit employee can be assigned to a classroom. Additionally:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who substitute during their preparation/conference period pursuant to Article I,<br/>Section 4, shall be paid $50.00 per period.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that there is no substitute available at the elementary level, the class will be<br/>split into no more than three (3) groups and assigned to other classes. Teachers who<br/>have a group assigned to their class will be paid $25.00 per hour.</p>
<p>Section 11: Compensatory Release Time</p>

<p>Section 12: Budget Allocations</p>
<p>Allocations per student and grade level shall be determined by the site level administrator and<br/>presented on the first working day of the school year after reviewing input from any interested site<br/>bargaining unit employees. Control of said budget allocations and communications of changes shall be<br/>the responsibility of the site level administrator.</p>

<p>Section 3: Timelines, pre-evaluation conference).</p>
<p>1) Standards of Evaluation</p>
<p>During each evaluation period, bargaining unit employees will be evaluated on six (6)</p>
<p>California standards for the teaching profession. Each standard will include several</p>
<p>[-17-]</p>
<p>components. The standards are:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and organizing subject matter for student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a professional educator</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher Personal Goals</p>
<p>Each teacher shall set at least one measurable goal in each of the above standards.<br/>Methods to achieve these teacher-specific goals shall be discussed and mutually<br/>agreed upon, if possible. (Pre-evaluation Goals, Appendix E: 2).</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disagreement over Goal Setting</p>
<p>In the event of a disagreement over the goals, methods to attain the goals or the time<br/>schedules, the bargaining unit employee shall have the opportunity to state the<br/>bargaining unit employee's position on the matter(s) and to attach a written statement<br/>to the evaluation form.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different Standards for Non-teaching Personnel</p>
<p>Goals and standards of evaluation may be different for non-teaching bargaining unit<br/>employees (e.g. nurse, counselor, and librarian),</p>
<p>c) Formal Observations</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal classroom observations shall last at least twenty (20) minutes and shall be<br/>scheduled at least one (1) week prior to the observation.</p>

<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each observation shall be followed by a written Certificated Observation Report.<br/>(Appendix E: 5).</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the observation was satisfactory, this written report will be provided to the<br/>bargaining unit employee within fifteen (15) working days.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the observation was less than satisfactory, this report will be presented to the<br/>bargaining unit employee and a “Post Observation Conference” will be held within<br/>one week of the formal observation.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary bargaining unit employees shall ordinarily receive three (3) formal<br/>observations.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenured bargaining unit employees, whose last Evaluation was satisfactory in all<br/>areas, shall receive at least two (2) formal observations.</p>
<p>[-18-]</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenured bargaining unit employees, whose last evaluation was not satisfactory in all<br/>areas, shall receive at least three (3) formal observations.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit employee who receives an unsatisfactory observation report may<br/>request an observation by another administrator. This request will be honored<br/>provided it can occur within the timelines of the evaluation. The bargaining unit<br/>employee will select a District Office administrator from a list of two (2) provided to the<br/>bargaining unit employee by the District. This observation and follow-up report will<br/>become part of the bargaining unit employee’s permanent record. However, the<br/>primary evaluator remains responsible for the succeeding steps in the evaluation<br/>process.</p>
<p>Evaluations</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the required observations, the evaluator will complete the summary<br/>Evaluation Report (Appendix E: 3) for each bargaining unit employee. Note that each of the<br/>California Standards for the teaching profession has an overall “Standard Rating”, and the<br/>entire evaluation has an “Overall Rating”. These ratings will be determined as follows:</p>
<p>“Standard Rating”- Satisfactory, Needs Improvement, Unsatisfactory<br/>A “Standard Rating” will be considered “Unsatisfactory” if two or more components of<br/>that standard are ranked “Unsatisfactory&quot;.</p>
<p>A “Standard Rating” that is not “Unsatisfactory”, can either be “Satisfactory” or<br/>“Needs Improvement”.</p>
<p>“Overall Rating”-Satisfactory; Unsatisfactory</p>
<p>The “Overall Rating” will be considered “Satisfactory” if each “Standard Rating” is<br/>Satisfactory or if less than three (3) “Standard Ratings” are “Needs Improvement”.</p>
<p>The “Overall Rating” will be considered “Unsatisfactory” if any “Standard Rating” is<br/>“Unsatisfactory” or if the “Standard Rating” in three (3) or more standards is “Needs<br/>Improvement”.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the evaluation report for placement in the bargaining unit employee’s<br/>personnel file , the evaluator shall rely upon data collected through classroom observations,<br/>incident reports, if any, written memorandum(s), which the bargaining unit employee has<br/>had the opportunity to review and to make comments, and informal observations of day-to-<br/>day performance. The evaluation form shall contain no “ratings” other than “satisfactory”,<br/>“needs improvement”, or “unsatisfactory”. In the event the bargaining unit employee<br/>disputes the content, the bargaining unit employee may prepare a written statement that<br/>shall be attached to the evaluation.</p>
<p>[-19-]</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory Evaluations</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bargaining unit employee receives a less than satisfactory evaluation, the<br/>evaluator shall present a remediation plan (Appendix E: 6) which shall include, but not<br/>be limited to the following:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific directives for improvement (which shall be mutually agreed upon, if possible)</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct assistance to implement such recommendations</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures to measure improvement and evidence necessary to achieve<br/>satisfactory evaluation</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time schedule to achieve progress</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those bargaining unit employees with remediation plans, a second evaluation will<br/>follow the completion of the plan (See Section 3: Timelines).</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent bargaining unit employees who receive an unsatisfactory evaluation on<br/>this second evaluation shall be:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluated the following school year.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referred to the Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program for mandatory<br/>participation (See Trust Agreement for details)(Classroom teachers only)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denied the step increase on the salary schedule. If this employee receives a<br/>satisfactory evaluation during the following year, the employee will resume salary<br/>step progression at the beginning of the next school year.</p>
<p>Grievances</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance were filed concerning an evaluation, the timelines would begin with the<br/>completion date of the evaluation.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations which have an Overall Rating of &quot;satisfactory&quot; and indicate that the<br/>bargaining unit employee is recommended for retention shall not be subject to the<br/>grievance procedures.</p>
<p>Evaluations outside the normal timelines</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a tenured bargaining unit employee changes assignment and/ or site, that employee<br/>may be evaluated the school year of the change.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit employees who receive two (2) Incident Reports, defined as violations<br/>of the Education Code, School District policies, or the collective bargaining unit<br/>agreement, may be evaluated immediately, if necessary, to expedite the remediation<br/>process.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit employee begins employment in the District after October 1,<br/>timeframes will be adjusted as necessary so that an evaluation takes place by the end<br/>of the school year.</p>
<p>[-20-]</p>
<p>h) Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program</p>
<p>The Association and the District have agreed to establish and maintain a program pursuant<br/>to Education Code Section 44500, et.

Site level administrators<br/>may maintain a file necessary for day-to-day supervision and management, but copies of all material<br/>upon which action might be based shall be placed in the District file. This shall not limit the District's right<br/>to introduce relevant evidence in any hearing or litigation.</p>
<p>Materials in personnel files of bargaining unit employees, which may serve as a basis for affecting</p>
<p>the status of their employment, are to be made available for the inspection of the person involved. Such</p>
<p>[-21 -]</p>
<p>materials shall be placed in the files within ninety (90) days following the act or occurrence upon which it<br/>is based or within ninety (90) days of the date the District should reasonably have known of the act or<br/>occurrence.</p>

<p>Every bargaining unit employee shall have the right to inspect such material in either the District's<br/>or the site administrator's file upon request, provided that the inspection is made at a time when such<br/>person is not actually required to render services to the employing District. This request for an<br/>appointment shall be made at least one (1) hour in advance of the inspection. Each bargaining unit<br/>employee may have another Association employee present when inspecting and reviewing the<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>Information of a derogatory nature, except material mentioned in the third (3<sup>rd</sup>) paragraph of this<br/>section, shall not be entered or filed unless and until the bargaining unit employee is given notice and an<br/>opportunity to review and comment thereon.</p>
<p>Such review shall take place during normal business hours, and the bargaining unit employee<br/>and the bargaining unit employee designee shall be released from duty for this purpose without salary<br/>reduction.

<p>year of service. Bargaining unit employees employed less than five (5) school days a<br/>week shall be entitled, for a school year of service, to that proportion of ten (10) days<br/>leave of absence for personal illness or injury as the number of days employed per week<br/>bears to five (5). Bargaining unit employees employed eleven (11) months shall be<br/>entitled to eleven (11) days of absence for personal illness or injury, with full pay, for a<br/>school year of service.</p>
<p>Pay for any days of absence shall be the same as the pay that would have been received<br/>had the employee served during the day of absence.</p>
<p>Sick leave accounts shall be issued annually at the beginning of the school year. Each<br/>bargaining unit employee's account shall be increased by the number of sick leave days<br/>to be earned in the ensuing school year.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee does not utilize the full ten (10) days leave of absence under this section,<br/>the days shall be accumulated to the bargaining unit employee’s credit, without limit, to be<br/>used in subsequent years.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of any period of absence due to illness or injury, the bargaining unit<br/>employee, at the request of the immediate supervisor, shall submit a written statement in<br/>proof of the bargaining unit employee's medical inability to work.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit employee may be required to submit a medical release indicating the<br/>ability to assume full duties as assigned following an absence of five (5) days or more, or<br/>if cause exists to believe the employee should not be at work.

<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year, when a bargaining unit employee has exhausted all<br/>accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent from his/her duties because of illness<br/>or accident, the bargaining unit employee is entitled to an additional period of up to five (5)<br/>school months for the same illness or accident, whether or not the absence arises out of<br/>or in the course of employment. The sick leave period, including accumulated sick leave<br/>and the five-month (5) period shall run consecutively.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the extended sick leave period when the fully paid sick leave is exhausted, the<br/>bargaining unit employee will receive substitute differential pay for thirty (30) workdays.<br/>The amount deducted from the bargaining unit employee’s salary shall not exceed the<br/>sum that is actually paid the substitute or the amount that would have been paid to the<br/>substitute had one been hired. Following the thirty (30) day period and for the balance of<br/>the five (5) months, the bargaining unit employee shall receive sixty percent (60%) of the<br/>bargaining unit employee’s salary.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit employee shall not be provided more than one five (5) month period per<br/>illness or accident. However, if a school year terminates before the five (5) month period is<br/>exhausted, the balance of the five-month (5) period may be used in the subsequent<br/>school year, if needed.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no case will there be paid or unpaid leave granted beyond the five (5) month period<br/>already mentioned except as otherwise required by law. When a bargaining unit employee<br/>has used all sick leave and extended sick leave, and the bargaining unit employee is not<br/>medically able to resume the duties of the bargaining unit employee’s position, the<br/>bargaining unit employee shall be placed on a reemployment list. If the bargaining unit<br/>employee is tenured, the time period will be not more than thirty-nine (39) months. If the<br/>bargaining unit employee is probationary, the time period will not be more than twenty-four<br/>(24) months. If the bargaining unit employee becomes medically able to return to the<br/>bargaining unit employee’s duties during the twenty-four (24) or thirty-nine (39) month<br/>period, the bargaining unit employee credentialed shall be returned to employment in a<br/>position for which he or she is credentialed and qualified. The twenty-four (24) or thirty-<br/>nine (39) month period shall commence at the expiration of the five (5) month period<br/>described previously.</p>

<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for bereavement leave should be made in writing when practicable, to the site<br/>administrator, and shall indicate the name of the deceased and his/her relationship to the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit employee may request in writing an extension of bereavement leave.<br/>Such extension may be granted if necessary for travel or in carrying out the<br/>responsibilities of the bargaining unit employee in connection with the death. For this<br/>extension, the bargaining unit employee may utilize Personal Leave if available.

<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination - Types of sabbatical leaves may be combined in one (1) semester or in<br/>separate semesters in accordance with the following:</p>

<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Education's report of an industrial accident or illness shall be kept on file in<br/>the Business Office.</p>
<p>g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of leave provided in this paragraph are separate from sick leave benefits.<br/>Accordingly, sick leave deducted from the bargaining unit employee's allotment shall be</p>
<p>reinstated upon verification of absence due to industrial accident.</p>
<p>[- 29 -]</p>
<p>h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit employee is absent from the employee's duties due to industrial<br/>accident or illness, the bargaining unit employee shall be paid such portion of his/her<br/>salary for any month in which absence occurs, as when added to the bargaining unit<br/>employee's temporary disability indemnity under Division 4 (four) or Division 4.5 (four<br/>point five) of the Labor Code, and shall result in a payment to the bargaining unit<br/>employee of not more than the bargaining unit employee's full salary.</p>
<p>i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one (1) day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>

<p>n) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the bargaining unit employee<br/>shall be entitled to the benefits provided for sick leave (Section I and 2 of this article) and<br/>the bargaining unit employee's absence for such purpose shall be deemed to have<br/>commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, provided<br/>that if the bargaining unit employee continued to receive temporary disability indemnity,<br/>the bargaining unit employee may elect to take as much of the bargaining unit employee's<br/>accumulated sick leave which, when added to the bargaining unit employee’s temporary<br/>disability indemnity will result in payment to the bargaining unit employee of not more than<br/>the employee’s full salary.</p>
<p>o) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bargaining unit employee has a medical release for limited duties, the bargaining<br/>unit employee must contact the Human Resources Office to determine if the bargaining<br/>unit employee’s assignment can be modified to allow the bargaining unit employee’s<br/>return.

<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave is available to a bargaining unit employee who is unable to<br/>perform the duties of her job because of a disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or<br/>related medical conditions. Note that this is not a leave for child bonding or child rearing.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit employee who is absent from duties for disability caused by pregnancy<br/>shall be entitled to utilize available sick leave, as defined in Article N, Section I, and<br/>Extended Sick Leave, as defined in Article N, Section 2.</p>

<p>The determination, as to the date on which the leave shall begin and the duration of such leave,<br/>shall be made at the discretion of the Superintendent when considering the scheduling and replacement<br/>problems of the District.</p>
<p>The duration of such leave shall consist of no more than twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>There shall not be a diminution of employment status for child-bearing or child-rearing except that<br/>no bargaining unit employee shall be entitled to compensation or increment, nor shall the time taken on<br/>parental leave count toward credit for probationary bargaining unit employees in earning tenure status.</p>
<p>If a bargaining unit employee is on leave for childbearing preparation or child-rearing and in the<br/>event of a miscarriage, or death, of a child subsequent to childbirth, the bargaining unit employee may<br/>request an immediate assignment to a bargaining unit employee position. If there is a vacancy for which<br/>a bargaining unit employee is qualified, the District will assign the bargaining unit employee to a position<br/>as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>Section 14: Catastrophic Leave Donation</p>
<p>Pursuant to Education Code Section 44043.5(f), all certificated employees may donate sick leave<br/>credit to certificated employees when that certificated employee or a member of his or her immediate<br/>family suffers from a district-verified catastrophic illness or injury. A certificated employee may also use<br/>sick leave when there is a catastrophic illness or accident in the immediate family (as defined in<br/>bereavement leave). Business Services shall administer the records regarding the donation of sick leave<br/>credit and allocation of that credit to the affected certificated employee.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave must be requested. See Appendix H in back for proper forms for both the<br/>individual requesting and those wishing to donate. It is important that it is clearly stated why the situation<br/>is catastrophic.</p>
<p>Within 15 working days of receiving all of the completed paperwork, a committee will review the<br/>application. The committee, consisting of two association representatives and two District<br/>representatives, will be the final decision on the approval and length of leave.</p>
<p>This committee will also review the application for the possibility of converting the applicant's sick</p>
<p>[-36-]</p>
<p>leave into personal leave.</p>
<p>Effective the school year 2010-2011 catastrophic leave is designed to allow an eligible bargaining<br/>unit employee to take additional paid leave as well as assist the bargaining unit employee with the<br/>amount of money to be received for the days after the bargaining unit employee has used all of the<br/>bargaining unit employee’s fully paid days. The first twenty (20) days of catastrophic leave shall be used<br/>after the exhaustion of the eligible bargaining unit employee's own fully-paid sick leave and prior to the<br/>commencement of the five (5) school months of leave described in Section 2 of this Article. Any<br/>remaining days of catastrophic leave shall run concurrently with the five (5) months.</p>
<p>Section 15: Reinstatement from Leave</p>
<p>Except as provided in other sections, the bargaining unit employee shall be returned to the<br/>position the employee held at the time the leave was granted, provided conditions have not arisen which<br/>would have changed the bargaining unit employee's location and type of work, had that bargaining unit<br/>employee remained in active service. In the event of changed conditions, the bargaining unit employee<br/>shall be reinstated and assigned to work appropriate to that bargaining unit employee's credential, field<br/>of training or experience.</p>
<p>According to current Education Code, no salary step progression shall occur if the leave exceeds<br/>25% of the number of regularly scheduled workdays.</p>
<p>Section 16: Elected Office Leave</p>
<p>This section is implemented in recognition that a bargaining unit employee elected to office of<br/>certain local public agencies will benefit the District and its students. Further, service on such a board or<br/>council will promote the ideals of public service to students and cooperation between local agencies.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit employee is eligible for elected office leave if elected to the governing<br/>board of a local public agency that is defined as. and limited to, the San Bernardino<br/>County Board of Supervisors, a local city council, or a water district that geographically<br/>overlaps the geographical boundaries of Morongo Unified School District.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eligible bargaining unit employee is entitled to three (3) days of elected office leave<br/>each school year. The District will pay for the substitute teacher for three (3) days. The<br/>bargaining unit employee also has the potential of three (3) more matching days to be<br/>paid by the other agency. It is the bargaining unit employee's responsibility to work it out<br/>with the other agency and obtain a written commitment from the other agency prior to use<br/>of any days.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to using elected office leave, the bargaining unit employee shall take all reasonable<br/>steps to schedule the local agency business during non-school hours.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for this leave must be submitted in writing and approved by the site<br/>administrator and the Superintendent. The Superintendent or his designee will monitor<br/>the employee’s non-illness related absences to insure that there are not abuses of this<br/>section.</p>

<p>[- 49 -]</p>
<p>ARTICLE U: CONCERTED ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>It is agreed and understood that there will be no strike, work stoppage, slowdown, picketing in<br/>connection with the foregoing, or refusal or failure to fully and faithfully perform job functions and<br/>responsibilities, or other interruption of the operations of the District by the Association or by its officers,<br/>agents, or employees during the term of this Agreement, including compliance with the requests of other<br/>labor organizations to engage in such activity.</p>
<p>The Association recognizes the duty and obligation of its representatives to comply with the<br/>provisions of this Agreement and to make every effort toward inducing all bargaining unit employees to<br/>do so. In the event of a strike, work stoppage, slowdown, or other interruption of the operations of the<br/>District by bargaining unit employees who are represented by the Association, the Association agrees in<br/>good faith to take all necessary steps to cause those bargaining unit employees to cease such action.</p>
<p>It is agreed and understood that any bargaining unit employee violating this Article may be<br/>subject to discipline up to and including dismissal by the District.</p>
<p>It is understood that in the event the Association violates this Article, the District shall be entitled<br/>to withdraw any rights, privileges, or services provided for in this Agreement. In the event the<br/>Association violates this Article, the above constitutes a clear, specific waiver of its rights of bargaining<br/>unit employees it represents under Education Code Section 45060.</p>
<p>Neither the submission of the proposal, nor its expiration or violation, shall prejudice the District's<br/>legal position that the activities proscribed herein are or may be independent violations of the law<br/>notwithstanding this Article.</p>
<p>The parties also agree and understand that this Article shall be suspended if they fail to reach<br/>agreement on subjects reopened for negotiations after completing impasse procedures set forth in the<br/>Rodda Act, and either party give written notice to the other party of its intent to suspend this Article. The<br/>suspension of the Article is intended to remove contractual limitations and not as either an endorsement<br/>of either party's activities, nor shall it constitute a limitation on either party's right to contest those<br/>activities on grounds other than contract violation claims. The purpose of said suspension is to exclude<br/>the possibility that either party could seek an injunction or other relief based on this Article after it had<br/>been suspended. The Article will be reinstated upon agreement on subjects reopened for negotiations.</p>

<p>ARTICLE V: COMPLETION OF MEET AND NEGOTIATION</p>

<p>and even though such subjects or matters were proposed and later withdrawn.</p>
<p>t- 50 -]</p>
<p>This Article is not intended to relieve the District of its obligations to negotiate with the Association<br/>prior to changing any term or condition of employment within the scope of bargaining as described in<br/>Section 3543.2 of the Government Code.</p>
<p>The terms of this Agreement shall be held binding and in force, not regarding any future imposed<br/>wage increase ceilings.</p>
<p>The Morongo Teachers Association shall receive from Morongo Unified School District good and<br/>appropriate advance notice of its intent to reconfigure a school to year-round Education. If a<br/>reconfiguration is to occur, Morongo Teachers Association and Morongo Unified School District shall<br/>immediately meet to negotiate those items that affect unit employees' work conditions.</p>

<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Appendix H: 1</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave applicant submits Catastrophic Leave Request to Human Resources along with necessary<br/>supportive documents attached to form. If desired, the applicant may attend the committee review<br/>for presentation purposes.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donor submits Catastrophic Leave Donation form to Human Resources.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within fifteen (15) workdays of receiving completed paperwork, the committee reviews application<br/>according to the following criteria:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it catastrophic? (See definitions on back of leave request forms.) E.g. pregnancy leave in<br/>itself is not catastrophic. Having the flu several times is not catastrophic.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all the supportive documentation submitted?</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should applicant's sick leave be converted to personal leave? E.g. the applicant's parent is<br/>terminally ill.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much sick leave is available and how much is needed?</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were applicant’s medical services critical or elective? E.g. elective surgery should be<br/>postponed until off duty times.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is further information required?</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donor forms will be reviewed.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the committee will be final and will be communicated to the applicant as well as the<br/>donor(s).</p>

<p>TRUST AGREEMENTS</p>
<p>Included in the following pages are descriptions of various Trust Agreements currently in<br/>effect and are included herein not as an integral part of the contractual agreement but as an<br/>informational reference for staff to access.</p>
<p>SHARED CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>2013-2014<br/>TRUST AGREEMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITION</p>
<p>A shared contract is defined as one in which one teaching position is shared by two<br/>bargaining unit employees for a period of not less than one year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>The total number of bargaining unit employees in the District Shared Contract Program for<br/>any one year shall not exceed two percent (2%) rounded to the nearest whole number of<br/>the total number of bargaining unit employees in the District as of October 1 in the selection<br/>year. Each site is limited to one team per school year.</p>
<p>Shared contract positions may be obtained by current full-time employees who meet the<br/>following qualifications:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenured</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory evaluation on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most recent evaluation</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory attendance</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold a valid teaching credential for the entire ensuing year</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful completion of application and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selection process</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract-sharing team members are expected to perform all usual and customary<br/>duties of a teaching position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible site administrator and the contract-sharing team will work out<br/>operational duties.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each team member agrees to abide by current contract.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each team member agrees to attend all Staff Development Programs.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team members agree to meet regularly on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS</p>
<p>1. Each team member receives the proportional salary per placement on the current<br/>salary schedule as the percentage each member works.</p>
<p>[-111 -]</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a team member works fifty percent (50%) or more, the District will pay the same<br/>percentage of the fringe benefits as the member works. The member will pay the<br/>difference if the benefits are desired. If the fringe benefits are not desired, the<br/>member will have a one-time opportunity to decline the entire benefit package. This<br/>decision will remain in effect unless the member returns to full-time. If a team<br/>member works less than fifty percent (50%), there will be no benefits.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a team member works fifty percent (50%) or more, advancement on the current<br/>salary schedule as now prescribed under the contractual agreement applies.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a team member works less than fifty percent (50%), then step advancement on<br/>the salary schedule occurs every two (2) years.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each team member is permitted the proportional amount of any leaves chargeable.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one team member is absent, the assignment will be offered to the other<br/>member prior to requesting a substitute. The team member will be paid at a<br/>substitute’s rate of pay.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect attendance stipends will be made as a proportional entitlement.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSITION STATUS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the contract-sharing team desiring to return to full-time status the next<br/>year would so indicate by March 1. The member would then be subject to transfer<br/>procedures outlined in the current contractual agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit employees desiring to share a contract must apply each year by<br/>April 1.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one member of the contract-sharing team desired to remain in a contract-sharing<br/>arrangement, the member will follow the application process prescribed in the next<br/>section (Section “F”)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after the transfer procedures are followed and a bargaining unit employee does<br/>not have a position by June 1, then the District shall make an assignment.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPLICATION AND SELECTION PROCESS</p>
<p>1. The team member desiring a contract-sharing position would send a letter to the<br/>District Human Resources Office. To be included in this letter would be the<br/>following:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of both bargaining unit employees desiring to share a contract;</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site, grade, subject preference;</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A definite plan presented in writing to include a system for implementation<br/>of management details, i.e., duty, discipline plan, preparation time, etc.;</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Office shall conduct an initial screening of all team<br/>proposals based upon the eligibility criteria in Section “B.&quot; The school site that has<br/>set forth its criteria for the opening shall make the selection. The decision shall be<br/>based upon the applicant’s training and the advertised position description, and<br/>what is educationally sound for the students.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific approval by the Board of Education will be the final step in implementing a<br/>team into a position.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible site administrator will evaluate the program at that site by March 1.<br/>If the program is discontinued at that site for the following year, the contract-sharing<br/>team may request another site through the application process.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 8, this program will be reviewed by the District and MTA. If the program is<br/>discontinued, participating bargaining unit employees become subject to transfer<br/>procedures outlined in the current contractual agreement. If, after these procedures<br/>are followed and a need still exists, the District shall make assignments.</p>

<p>MORONGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>SCHOOL-BASED MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION<br/>PROCEDURES</p>
<p>2013-2014</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goal of School-Based Management is to improve the academic performance of all<br/>students by empowering the staff and parents at each school to develop programs that will<br/>meet the needs of their students.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School-Based Management is a process used to empower employees with the necessary<br/>decision-making authority to efficiently and effectively accomplish their jobs.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School-Based Management requires that the people most affected by a decision participate in<br/>making that decision.</p>
<p>All schools will have the benefits of LEVEL I, which include:</p>
<p>V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Decentralization - each school will have authority over its budget, both general<br/>fund and categorical dollars</p>
<p>v' Personnel Selection - to the maximum extent possible, selection of personnel will be<br/>made by a site-level committee</p>
<p>Schools may elect to move to LEVEL II, which include:</p>
<p>S Management by Elected Council - The Single Plan for Student Achievement and<br/>supporting budget will be developed by a council composed of elected teachers and<br/>parents.</p>
<p>V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waivers - The School-Based Management Council may develop programs that require<br/>waivers of Board of Education Policy, MTA or CSEA contracts, Education Code, or past<br/>practice.</p>
<p>S Flexibility - Additional flexibility in budget and allocation of resources may be granted to<br/>LEVEL II schools.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school is accountable for showing progress toward meeting Federally approved State<br/>accountability requirements through the annual School Accountability Report Card. LEVEL II<br/>schools will revert to LEVEL I if they do not show progress toward meeting the standards, as<br/>determined by the Superintendent in annual evaluations.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the effectiveness of the School-Based Management Council process at a school<br/>will be conducted by the Superintendent, if requested by fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br/>certificated and classified staff working at that site.</p>
<p>[-126-]</p>
<p>LEVEL I</p>
<p>POLITICAL DECENTRALIZATION</p>
<p>The Board of Education and District administration are responsible for:</p>
<p>S Maintaining a clear focus by developing the mission, goals and objectives for the District and<br/>communicating them to all stakeholders.</p>
<p>v' Developing and supervising the accountability system to evaluate each school’s progress<br/>toward achievement of District and site-level goals.</p>
<p>S Maintaining a centralized core curriculum.</p>
<p>s Ensuring that all schools are in compliance with state and federal regulations.</p>
<p>s Providing each school with the support needed to develop and implement effective instructional<br/>programs.</p>
<p>V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing and maintaining policies which comply with Education Code, insure a quality<br/>education for all students and support site-based efforts.</p>
<p>At LEVEL I, the Principal is responsible for:</p>
<p>v' Developing and implementing the Single Plan for Student Achievement.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demographics</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of assessment data</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action plans to support achievement of Board of Education Goals</p>
<p>S Developing and maintaining the school budget that supports the School Plan.</p>
<p>S Ensuring an effective instructional program for all students.</p>
<p>V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring that Board of Education Policies, Education Code and state and federal regulations<br/>are followed.</p>
<p>v'' Participating in the selection of personnel.</p>
<p>At all levels, the Principal is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school and is held<br/>accountable for implementation of the Single Plan for Student Achievement.</p>
<p>At LEVEL I:</p>
<p>The secondary Academic Councils have major responsibility for oversight of curriculum and<br/>instruction issues and plans.</p>
<p>The junior high Academic Councils are composed of the Principal, Department Chairpersons, Head<br/>Counselor, and MTA Representative.</p>
<p>The Comprehensive High School Academic Councils are composed of the Principal, Department<br/>Chairpersons, Head Counselor, Athletic Director, Activities Director, and MTA Representative.</p>
<p>The Continuation High School Academic Councils are composed of all certificated staff members.<br/>The Elementary Councils are composed of the Principal, two teacher representatives selected by<br/>teachers at the school; other school personnel selected by other school personnel at the school;<br/>parents of pupils attending the school who are selected by parents classroom teachers shall comprise<br/>the majority of persons.</p>
<p>[- 127 -]</p>
<p>LEVEL II</p>
<p>SHARED DECISION-MAKING</p>
<p>The authority the District shares with the school is then shared by the Principal with staff, parents,<br/>students and community members as a School-Based Management Council. Each school creates its<br/>own approach within the parameters determined by the Board of Education, following the rules<br/>contained in the Brown Act, and agreements with the employee associations as required. This is a<br/>continuously evolving process.</p>
<p>The Board of Education and District administration continue to be responsible for all items listed in<br/>LEVEL I above.</p>
<p>1. Composition of the School-Based Management Council:</p>
<p>The School-Based Management Council is composed of representatives of all stakeholders and is<br/>of sufficient size to be representative but also manageable. NOTE: Parents who are school<br/>employees may NOT be counted as non-employees for parent representation.</p>
<p>Councils are encouraged to maintain an Open Chair as a way to include all stakeholders. Any<br/>interested party may attend a Council meeting and provide input on issues of interest or concern.<br/>The Open Chair does not vote.</p>
<p>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (LEVEL II)</p>
<p>Option I:</p>
<p>The School Site Council, mandated by Single Plan for Student Achievement, may serve as the<br/>School-Based Management Council.</p>
<p>There must be parity between school employees and non-employees. Each group elects its own<br/>representatives.</p>
<p>One of the teachers must be the MTA representative. At least one classified employee, who is a<br/>CSEA member and is elected by peers, must be included on this joint council, and counts as an<br/>employee.</p>
<p>Option II:</p>
<p>The School-Based Management Council may be a different group from the School Site Council, with<br/>some members in common.</p>
<p>The School Site Council must be composed according to the rules above.</p>
<p>The School-Based Management Council must have an equal number of parents and teachers but not<br/>necessarily parity between parents and employees.</p>
<p>The MTA representative must be a member of the School-Based Management Council. One<br/>classified employee, appointed by CSEA, serves on the School-Based Management Council.</p>
<p>[-128-]</p>
<p>MIDPLE/JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL (LEVEL II)</p>
<p>At the Junior High Level, the Academic Council is composed of the Principal, Department<br/>Chairpersons, Head Counselor, and MTA Representative.</p>
<p>Option I:</p>
<p>The School Site Council, mandated by Single Plan for Student Achievement, may serve as the<br/>School-Based Management Council.</p>
<p>In this case, there must be parity between school employees and non-employees. Each group elects<br/>its own representatives.</p>
<p>The non-employee group may be composed of parents, who are not school employees, community<br/>members and students. Students may comprise up to fifty percent (50%) of this group.</p>
<p>One of the teachers must be the MTA representative. At least one classified employee, who is a<br/>CSEA member and is elected by peers, must be included on this joint council, and counts as an<br/>employee.</p>
<p>In this option, the Academic Council would be a separate body, with some members selected to serve<br/>on the School-Based Management Council.</p>
<p>Option II:</p>
<p>The Academic Council may serve as the School-Based Management Council, with the addition of at<br/>least one parent and one CSEA representative appointed by CSEA.</p>
<p>There must be a Parent Advisory Group that provides guidance to the School-Based Management<br/>Council. This group selects one or more member(s) to represent them on the School-Based<br/>Management Council, as outlined in the School-Based Management Bylaws.
