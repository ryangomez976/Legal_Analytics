<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to reasonable use of school facilities, at reasonable hours, for<br/>Association business. Requests to utilize such facilities shall be made in accordance with current District<br/>policy and shall be contingent upon securing the permission of the site administrator. The site administrator<br/>may deny permission if the facilities have been previously reserved by groups entitled to their use or if the<br/>usage by the Association would interfere with the school activities. The Association shall have the right to<br/>use District educational technology equipment and studios for Association business, so long as such use<br/>does not interfere with the District’s regular instructional program.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to post notices of activities and matters of Association concern on<br/>designated bulletin boards in each school building in areas frequented by teachers.

<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCTA will provide the district with a list of its officers, negotiators, and site representatives at the beginning<br/>of each school year.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) days of ratification of the Agreement by both parties herein, the District shall have copies<br/>prepared and delivered to the Association.

<p>ARTICLE VIII<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by one or more unit members that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision of this Agreement. The substance of an evaluation<br/>pursuant to Article XV shall not be grievable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;aggrieved party&quot; is the unit member(s) making the claim.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;party in interest&quot; is any person who might be required to take action or against whom action<br/>might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which a unit member is required to render service to the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, solutions to the problems<br/>which may from time to time arise. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>C. Pre-Grievance Procedures</p>
<p>Potential grievances should be discussed by private conference between the parties. At least two private meetings<br/>between parties may take place before the grievance procedure is invoked.</p>
<p>D. Procedure</p>
<p>Level 1</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the potential grievance is not resolved at the informal meeting(s), the grievant may implement the<br/>provisions of this Article by presenting his/her grievance, in writing, to his/her supervisor within<br/>forty-five (45) working days of the occurrence.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance shall be presented in writing to the immediate supervisor using the grievance form. The<br/>immediate supervisor shall meet with the aggrieved party and/or designated counsel and/or<br/>Association representative within ten (10) days of receipt of the grievance. The immediate<br/>supervisor shall provide a written disposition of the grievance, including the reasons therefore to all<br/>parties of interest within ten (10) days of such meeting.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved party is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance or if no disposition has<br/>occurred within ten (10) days of such meeting or ten (10) days from the date of presentation of the<br/>grievance, the grievance may be appealed to Level Two, with a copy simultaneously provided to the<br/>Association President.</p>
<p>Level 2</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee shall meet with the aggrieved party and/or designated<br/>counsel and/or Association representative within ten (10) days of receipt of the grievance appeal and<br/>shall provide a written disposition of the grievance, including the reasons therefore, to all parties of<br/>interest within ten (10) days of such meeting.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved party is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance or if no disposition has<br/>occurred within ten (10) days of such meeting or twenty (20) days from the date of the receipt of the<br/>grievance at Level 2, the aggrieved party may request the Association to submit the grievance to<br/>arbitration.</p>
<p>Level 3</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association proceeds to arbitration, it shall notify the District in writing within twenty (20) days<br/>from the receipt of the disposition at Level 2, or if no disposition has occurred, within forty (40) days<br/>from the date the grievance was filed at Level 2. Within twenty (20) days of such notification,<br/>representatives of the District and the Association shall attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable<br/>arbitrator and obtain a commitment from said arbitrator to serve. If the parties are unable to agree<br/>upon an arbitrator within the specified period, the Association shall file a Demand to Arbitrate to the<br/>California Conciliation Service. The selection of the arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings shall<br/>be conducted under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth the findings of fact, reasoning and<br/>conclusions of the issues submitted. The arbitrator will be without power or authority to add to,<br/>subtract from or modify the terms of this Agreement, or to make any decision which requires the<br/>commission of an act prohibited by law or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement. The<br/>decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the Association and the Superintendent and will be final<br/>and binding upon the parties. If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such<br/>question will be ruled upon by the arbitrator only after he/she has had an opportunity to hear the<br/>merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>2. All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem expenses, his/her<br/>travel and subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing room, will be borne equally by the<br/>Board and the Association. All other costs will be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>E.</p>
<p>Time Limits</p>
<p>1. Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day following receipt of the grievance, grievance<br/>appeal, or written decision.</p>
<p>3. Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits specified at<br/>each level should be considered to be maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the<br/>process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in<br/>this grievance procedure by the end of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of<br/>the following school year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein<br/>will be reduced by mutual agreement so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the<br/>school year or as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an administrator at any step of this procedure fails to communicate the written decision on a<br/>grievance within the specified time limits, the aggrieved employee may proceed to the next step<br/>within 30 days after the administrators' time to respond has lapsed. Failure by the grievant at any<br/>step of this procedure to initiate a grievance or appeal a written decision to the next step within the<br/>specified time limits shall be deemed to be acceptance of the decision at the step.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that employees shall during and notwithstanding the pendency of any grievance,<br/>continue to observe all assignments and applicable policies, rules and regulations of the Board, and<br/>the terms of Agreement, until such grievance and any effect thereof shall have been fully<br/>determined.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grievance has been filed by a grievant, he/she may withdraw the grievance at any time by<br/>giving written notice to the District. Once a grievance is withdrawn, it cannot be presented again by<br/>the same grievant unless there is evidence of intimidation or threats of retaliation.</p>
<p>F. No Reprisals</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by any member or representative of the administration<br/>or the Board against any aggrieved party, any party in interest, any member of the Association or any other<br/>participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>G. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of administrators required to render decisions as outlined in the procedures, the<br/>Superintendent shall appoint a substitute.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance is made by a group of employees against one supervisor, only one grievance will be<br/>processed and the decision rendered will apply to all others affected. Another grievance(s) could be<br/>filed for a separate issue(s).</p>
<p>3. If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the administration at a level<br/>above the principal or immediate supervisor, the aggrieved party shall submit such grievance in<br/>writing directly to the Superintendent and the Association with the processing of such grievance to<br/>commence at Level 2.</p>
<p>4. When it is necessary for a grievant and representative designated by the Association to attend a</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>grievance meeting or hearing during the day, each will, upon notice to the Principal or immediate<br/>supervisor by the President of the Association, be released without loss of pay in order to permit<br/>participation in the foregoing procedures: however, every effort will be made to process grievances<br/>at times other than during the instructional day. Normally all processing of grievances shall be done<br/>after regular working hours.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance will be filed<br/>in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the participants.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon mutual agreement of the Association and the Superintendent, a grievance may be taken<br/>directly to arbitration.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member alleging a grievance may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by<br/>an Association designated representative.</p>
<p>A unit member may, at any time, present grievances to the employer and have such grievances adjusted,<br/>without the intervention of the Association, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with terms of the<br/>written Agreement. If any employee presents a grievance on his/her own behalf, the Association shall have<br/>the right to be present and state its views at all grievance meetings. The District shall not agree to a<br/>resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report of Activities: Each employee on sabbatical leave shall file with the District a written report not<br/>later than sixty (60) days after his/her return. The report shall contain data as to the activities of the<br/>teacher and transcripts of all college and university work completed. Each teacher on leave shall<br/>include an appraisal of the professional value or the experience gained while on leave and the<br/>manner in which such experience or knowledge gained may be used for the benefit of the students<br/>or school in which the teacher is located.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident or Illness: If the sabbatical program is interrupted because of serious illness or accident,</p>
<p>this shall not be considered a failure to fulfill the conditions upon which the leave was granted. It<br/>shall not affect the amount of compensation to be paid the employee, provided the District shall have<br/>been notified promptly of such accident or illness. [Notification &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;registered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;letter</p>
<p>within &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifteen (15) days of the time of the accident or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevented&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extenuating</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative merit of reasons for desiring leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direct benefit to the District.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasonable distribution of applicants in the various segments of the District.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of previous sabbatical leaves granted the applicant.</p>

<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNPAID LEAVE OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher may request an unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher on unpaid leave of absence shall not be entitled to receive wage and fringe benefits.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher on unpaid leave of absence shall give written notice to the District of intentions to return no<br/>later than February 15. Failure to give such notice will be considered as notice that the teacher does<br/>not intend to return and that his/her position is vacant.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher returning from an unpaid leave of absence shall return to a position for which he/she is<br/>qualified. If the teacher is to return to a different position or school, the change of position will be<br/>made in accordance with Article XIV.</p>

<p>A male teacher shall be entitled to three (3) days of paid leave of absence to attend his wife during childbirth. Such<br/>days shall be charged to the accumulated sick leave days of the teacher.</p>
<p>L.</p>
<p>FAMILY LEAVE</p>
<p>All provisions of the Family Leave Act shall be granted to qualified employees in accordance with District policy and<br/>State and Federal regulations. If State and Federal regulations differ from one another relative to specific issues,<br/>the regulation most beneficial to the unit member will be implemented.</p>
<p>M. CATASTROPHIC LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Catastrophic Leave Program, a teacher who has exhausted all of his or her sick<br/>leave may draw upon the leave program under the following conditions:</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is experiencing catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the teacher’s immediate family is experiencing catastrophic illness or injury.<br/>Immediate family for purposes of this item is spouse, domestic partner and children; other<br/>persons are subject to approval by the catastrophic leave committee.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of this program are limited to forty (40) days per teacher per fiscal year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illness or injury to the teacher or his/her immediate family member is expected to<br/>incapacitate the teacher or require the teacher’s direct supervision for an extended period of time<br/>and the taking of extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the teacher because he/she<br/>has exhausted all sick leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible leave credits mean sick leave accrued to the donating employee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may become a member of the Catastrophic Leave Program and thereby become eligible<br/>for receipt of the benefits under the program by filing with the District Personnel Office an irrevocable<br/>donation of one (1) sick day. Employees who enroll in the Catastrophic Leave Program will<br/>contribute one sick day each year until they have contributed a total of three sick days to the bank. If<br/>the total number of days in the bank drops below 80 days, the maximum number of days to be<br/>contributed will be increased by one sick day per member. One sick day per year will be contributed<br/>by existing participants beginning 2002/03 if they have not already contributed the maximum three<br/>days. For 2002/03, the enrollment period will be extended to November 1, 2002.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee comprised of three representatives from the Association shall be established when the<br/>application is received. The committee shall meet with a representative from the District Personnel<br/>Office to review, approve or deny on a case-by-case basis applications for leaves to be charged to<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first becoming eligible may enroll<br/>by notifying the District by September 15 of any given year. These new enrollees will have a waiting<br/>period of one school year after joining the Bank before becoming eligible to withdraw days from the<br/>Bank.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly hired teachers shall have 30 calendar days from the date of employment to enroll in the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Program and shall be assessed one (1) day of sick leave. The effective date of<br/>coverage shall be the first day of the month following enrollment. Newly hired teachers who enroll<br/>during the spring semester shall enroll and be assessed one (1) sick leave day and shall be exempt<br/>from assessment for the following school year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a teacher may donate up to 20 sick leave days to a member of his/her immediate family<br/>who is a teacher as defined in the agreement between the Mariposa County Teachers' Association<br/>and the District.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>To discontinue membership in the Catastrophic Leave Program, the member must provide written<br/>notice to the District of the intent to withdraw during the period of May 30 to June 30 to be effective<br/>the following fiscal year.</p>
<p>N. MISCELLANEOUS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided in this Article, a teacher on a paid leave of absence shall be entitled to<br/>receive credit for annual salary increments provided during his/her leave and to receive during<br/>his/her leave, all other teacher fringe benefits, including but not limited to insurance and retirement<br/>benefits.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time teachers who are absent on account of illness and who have exhausted their accumulated<br/>sick leave shall continue to receive full insurance coverage to be paid by the District not to exceed<br/>the remainder of the current school year and limited to one school year only for the same illness.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide teachers on approved unpaid leaves of absence the option to continue<br/>the District group plan of health insurance during the period of the leave. The employee shall<br/>reimburse the District for all premium costs of the insurance, monthly or quarterly, in advance, by<br/>the 25<sup>th</sup> of the month.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIV</p>
<p>TRANSFERS</p>
<p>Please Note: Article XIV does not apply to counselors, school psychologists, school nurses, and speech therapists</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOLUNTARY INTER-SCHOOL TRANSFERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of teacher vacancies shall be made available at the District Office and posted in all schools<br/>(during the school year only) as they occur. A copy of such list shall be emailed to all teachers. The<br/>list shall contain a closing date to apply for each vacancy which shall be no sooner than fourteen (14)<br/>calendar days after the vacancy occurs. The vacancy notice shall include the location, grade level or<br/>subject matter assignment, credential requirements, any special needs of the position, and date by<br/>which the position is to be filled. No assignment to fill the vacancy shall be made until after the<br/>closing date of said notice. A closing date less than 14 days may be used if approved by the MCTA<br/>President.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the school year the District will notify teachers where job vacancies will be advertised<br/>and/or posted during the summer. By June 1 of each school year, a teacher may submit an email<br/>address to the District Personnel Department if they wish to be notified of all job vacancies during the<br/>summer.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may submit a formal request for transfer to a listed vacancy at any time with the<br/>knowledge of the principal. The request shall follow required application procedures and deadlines<br/>as stated on the vacancy notice. The teacher will be considered with the interviewees.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a transfer is denied, the teacher, upon request, shall be given an immediate written rationale for<br/>the denial. No teacher shall be denied a formally requested transfer for arbitrary or capricious<br/>reasons.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be transferred to an existing vacant position for which they are qualified for a<br/>medical reason in accordance with law.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INVOLUNTARY INTER-SCHOOL TRANSFERS/REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers/reassignments shall only be made for the following reasons after discussion<br/>with the teacher involved and the MCTA President: a decrease in the number of students which<br/>requires a decrease in the number of teachers, elimination of programs, and/or funding, school<br/>closings, or as it relates to the teacher evaluation and improvement plan and to resolve a local<br/>situation of severe gravity.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a decrease in the number of students or the elimination of programs and/or funding occurs, the<br/>District shall seek volunteers prior to making involuntary transfer/reassignments. A teacher who<br/>voluntarily transfers to another school site under the conditions of this paragraph shall have the right<br/>of refusal for any vacancy at the school site where they were employed when transferred in<br/>accordance with B.11, provided they have the appropriate credential. If involuntary<br/>transfer/reassignment becomes necessary, the teacher with the least seniority shall be transferred or<br/>reassigned.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particular school is to be closed, then unit members shall also be accorded first priority for filling<br/>any new or vacant positions at the school or schools at which the students at the closing school are<br/>being placed for the coming year.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member from the closed school shall also be accorded first priority for filling all vacancies<br/>that arise for which they have the appropriate credential. The determination of which unit members<br/>shall fill vacancies when two or more of these members apply shall be based on seniority.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of intent of involuntary transfers shall be given to teachers in writing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three (3) working days after receiving the notice of intent, a teacher may request a meeting<br/>with the Superintendent or his designee to discuss the intended transfer. After this meeting, the<br/>teacher shall be notified in writing of the final decision.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to District needs, an administration initiated transfer shall consider the credential, major or<br/>minor field of study, performance, and area of expertise of the transferee.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher is transferred after the first contracted work day, the teacher shall be given at least five<br/>(5) days notice before the actual transfer occurs, and up to three (3) days of non-teaching duties to<br/>prepare for the new assignment.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are transferred involuntarily shall receive mileage reimbursement, if the distance<br/>added to the commute, from their residence at the time of the transfer to their new work location is<br/>more than 25 miles one-way, for a period of one contract year. The resulting mileage calculation is<br/>based on the distance from the site at time of transfer to/from the District Office one way as follows:<br/>To/From LDP: 50 miles; To/From YVS: 43 miles; To/From EP: 26 miles; To/From CHS: 26 miles.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers involuntarily transferred due to a reduction in force shall be entitled to the first right of<br/>refusal for any vacancy at the school site where they were employed when &quot;riffed&quot;, provided they<br/>have the appropriate credential. If a teacher is offered the first right of refusal to fill a vacancy that<br/>occurs after the first day of the school year and does not wish to accept the offer, the teacher will be<br/>provided with one additional offer to fill the next available vacancy at the original school site. If the<br/>teacher refuses the second offer to return to the site, regardless of when the vacancy occurs, no<br/>further offers will be made.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order of reassignment back to the original school site under the first right of refusal provisions in<br/>section B of article XIV shall be as follows: Teachers will exercise their first right of refusal in the<br/>chronological order in which they were transferred, regardless of whether the transfer was voluntary<br/>or involuntary (i.e. first to leave is first to return). If more than one teacher was involuntarily or<br/>voluntarily transferred on the same date, reassignment shall be in order of seniority. Should<br/>teachers have the same date of hire, the tie breaker criteria outlined in the most recently adopted<br/>layoff resolution will be utilized. These first right of refusal assignments will be resolved prior to<br/>reassignment of teachers who are being displaced due to layoff in the current school year.</p>
<p>C. INTRA-SCHOOL REASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may be reassigned within a school only after the principal meets with the teacher or<br/>teachers involved to discuss the problem.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom reassignment and/or subject changes shall not be made after three (3) weeks from the<br/>beginning of each semester or trimester unless an emergency occurs.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In self-contained classroom reassignments only, paragraph B.8 of this Article will be applicable</p>
<p>28</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may suspend any pupil from the teacher's class, in accordance with the provisions of<br/>Education Code Section 48900, for the day of suspension and the day following.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher, acting within the scope of his/her employment, duties, and responsibilities, may exercise<br/>the amount of physical control which is reasonably necessary under the circumstances to protect<br/>himself/herself from attack, to protect another person including pupils, and to protect property as<br/>provided in Education Code Section 44807.

<p>36</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVIII</p>
<p>PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the District that all instruction shall be fair, accurate, objective, appropriate to the age and<br/>maturity of the student(s), and sensitive to the community needs and the needs and values of our diverse<br/>cultures and heritages. State law and District policy also allow and require the Board to adopt the curriculum<br/>for the District and select appropriate texts and other materials to implement the adopted curriculum. Within<br/>these policies and requirements, teachers are entitled to a degree of protection from censorship or prior<br/>restraint which might interfere with their obligation to pursue truth in the performance of their teaching<br/>functions. Accordingly:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall have reasonable freedom in the classroom presentations and discussions and<br/>may introduce political, religious or otherwise controversial material, provided that the said material is<br/>accurate, relevant to the course, consistent with the age and maturity of the pupils and within the<br/>scope of the law.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing teaching functions, unit members shall have reasonable freedom to express their<br/>opinions on all matters relevant to the course content, and consistent with the grade level and age<br/>and maturity of the pupils, in an objective manner. A unit member, however, shall not use his/her<br/>position to indoctrinate students with his/her own personal political and/or religious views. Teachers<br/>will be encouraged to present opposing views on controversial issues.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may, and on request of the site administrator shall, submit any supplementary<br/>material or course content to a review committee for a determination of whether the material or<br/>content complies with the provisions of this article and current law. The review committee shall<br/>consist of one teacher selected by the Association who shall not be employed at the site of the<br/>teacher involved, an administrator not employed at the school of the teacher involved selected by the<br/>Superintendent and a member of the Board of Trustees selected by the President of the Board. The<br/>determination of the Review Committee shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal life of the unit member is not an appropriate concern of the District for purposes of evaluation<br/>or disciplinary action unless it interferes with the unit member's performance of his/her assigned duties,<br/>except as authorized by Education Code.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to full rights of citizenship, and no religious or political activities, or lack<br/>thereof, of any unit member shall be used for the purposes of evaluation or disciplinary action unless said<br/>activities violate local, state, or federal law.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIX</p>
<p>PUBLIC CHARGES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative and/or unsatisfactory evaluation shall be predicated upon information or material of a derogatory<br/>or critical nature which has been received by the evaluator from students, parents and/or citizens unless the<br/>following procedures have been followed:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any student, parent or citizen complaint about a unit member shall be reported to the unit member by<br/>the administrator receiving the complaint, within five (5) work days of receipt, if the complaint may be<br/>used against the member. Notification of a complaint received during the summer recess period will<br/>be mailed to the unit member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the involved unit member or the site administrator believe the allegations in the complaint<br/>warrant a meeting, the supervisor shall attempt to schedule a meeting between the unit member, the<br/>complainant and the administrator. At the request of the unit member, an Association representative<br/>may be present at the meeting.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is not resolved at the meeting to the satisfaction of the complainant, he/she may put the<br/>complaint in writing and submit the original to the unit member, with a copy to the unit member's<br/>immediate supervisor. The unit member shall be given time during the duty day, without salary<br/>reduction, to review the complaint. The complaint will not be placed in the unit member's personnel<br/>file unless the provisions of Article XV are followed.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints which are not reduced to writing are withdrawn or shown to be false shall neither be placed in<br/>the unit member's personnel file nor utilized in any evaluation or disciplinary action against the member.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>ARTICLE XX</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>Please Note: Article XX does not apply to counselors, school psychologists, school nurses, and speech therapists</p>
<p>A. Current contract language concerning class size will be maintained provided the District continues to monitor<br/>class size and explore solutions. It is recognized that variations in class size will occur and that class size is<br/>directly related to the availability of funds and space. Therefore, the District agrees to establish goals and<br/>guidelines as follows:</p>
<p>1. Self-contained Grades*<br/>K</p>
<p>1-3</p>
<p>4-6</p>
<p>7-8</p>
<p>Desirable</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>26<br/>28<br/>28</p>
<p>Maximum</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>2. Multi-graded classes in K-8 (self-contained) shall have the desirable and maximum numbers stated<br/>in paragraph A.1 adjusted as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Grades &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Students</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-3</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-4</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-5</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-6</p>
<p>3. Multi-graded classrooms in necessary small schools will have the desirable and maximum numbers<br/>stated in paragraphs A.1 adjusted as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Grades &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-3</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-5</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-7</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-9</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-11</p>
<p>It is understood that this would apply only to payment for oversize classes; not addition of teaching<br/>staff due to the difference in the way necessary small schools are funded (tier funding does not<br/>match these numbers). Payment for oversize classes under this formula would begin 05-06.</p>
<p>*Note: The above-stated desirable and maximum sizes pertain to all grade levels K though 8.</p>
<p>Grades 7 and 8 are not considered departmentalized and therefore the desirable<br/>and maximums for these grade levels will match that of grade 6.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>When departmentalization is utilized, the below-stated departmentalized sizes will pertain:</p>

<p>All classes with less than 12 students may be eliminated at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>B. If, at the end of the third month, class size equals a site average of 31 pupils per class, excluding special day<br/>class, for K-8 self-contained classes, additional teaching staff shall be added to the site. Such additional<br/>staffing shall be evaluated based on the criteria in this paragraph at the end of the school year to determine<br/>whether the position is needed for the following year. The administrator(s) of the school involved will consult<br/>with the teaching staff to determine the best grade configuration and assignment of teaching staff added<br/>under this paragraph. Sections A and C of this Article shall remain as part of the agreement. Additional<br/>teachers added pursuant to this section shall be used to determine the site average class size for<br/>subsequent years. Prep teachers hired for the purpose of fulfilling the requirements of Article X, Section C,<br/>Preparation Time, shall not be used to determine the site average class size.</p>
<p>Classes implemented in accordance with the optional Class Size Reduction Program (SB 1777) K-3 and<br/>receiving Class Size Reduction Funds (Chapter 6.10, commencing with Section 52120, of Part 28 of the<br/>Education Code) for the current year shall be excluded from determination of site averages providing such<br/>CSRP classes have no more than a total of 20 vacant student positions for growth.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the number of students in any class exceeds the stated maximum and when requested in writing by<br/>the teacher involved, the District will consider solutions to alleviate the situation. The Superintendent, or his<br/>designee, shall discuss the problem and possible solutions with the teacher. At the next meeting of the<br/>Board of Trustees, the Superintendent, or designee, shall report the problem and possible solutions.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the problems of remediation identified by the District's<br/>promotion/retention policy. Each school shall develop a remediation program within the present school<br/>and/or District resources available.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ending enrollment in any school calendar month exceeds the class size maximum, the teacher will be<br/>paid $40 per student per month for self-contained classrooms and $10 per student per month per class<br/>period for departmentalized classes for each student above the contractual maximum.</p>
<p>Payment for oversize classes for Mariposa County Independent Learning School (MCILS) will be based<br/>on the formula for self-contained classrooms as outlined in this section. All MCILS teachers must have<br/>25 assigned students prior to payment being made to an individual MCILS teacher for oversize classes.</p>
<p>School calendar months will be based on the approved school calendar. Payment will be made for 10<br/>calendar months. If the school calendar contains more than 10 school months, no payment will be made<br/>during the month with the fewest instructional days.</p>
<p>Payment will not be made for large group instruction such as Athletic PE, Music/Band, business, work<br/>experience, drama, and study hall classes. No payment will be made for elementary classes that are<br/>designed to be part of the Class Size Reduction program.</p>
<p>Payment will be made as part of the regular payroll in January and June.</p>
<p>The provisions of Article XX. B. related to adding additional teaching staff if the site average equals or<br/>exceeds 31 pupils per class may be waived with the written approval of the MCTA Executive Board on a<br/>case by case basis.</p>
<p>41</p>

<p>The payroll period shall be monthly. All teachers shall be paid in ten (10) or twelve (12) equal<br/>payments payable on the last working day of each calendar month which, in most cases,<br/>begins in September.

The required indirect and support costs will first be deducted from the<br/>annual allocation. Funds allocated under this section for substitute salaries shall not be<br/>carried over from one fiscal year to the next. If the No Child Left Behind Act is terminated<br/>in part or in total, or if funding parameters and requirements for Professional<br/>Development under Title 1, Part A of the Act are changed, the provisions of this section<br/>will terminate.</p>
<p>Conferences must meet the requirements for Title 1, Part A federal funds for professional<br/>development as determined by the district. Teachers must submit an application to be<br/>jointly developed by the association and district, and the Superintendent will review and<br/>approve each application.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health benefits will be prorated for new part-time teachers hired July 1, 1993 or later<br/>who work at least a 50% contract. The District will pay a prorated share of benefits<br/>when the employee reaches pay increments of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100%.<br/>The employee pays the balance of the cost to 100%. Employees who work 50% or<br/>more per day and who were hired prior to July 1, 1993 will continue to receive full<br/>benefits. Employees may choose not to participate in the entire benefits plan but may<br/>not opt out of only a portion of the plan.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January 1,2005, domestic partners are eligible for health benefits coverage<br/>in accordance with law under the terms of the provider’s plan document. In order for<br/>spouses or domestic partners to be enrolled for health care coverage, the employee<br/>must provide a copy of the Declaration of Domestic Partnership that was filed with<br/>the California Secretary of State or a Certificate of Marriage. If the Domestic<br/>Partnership or Marriage is terminated, the employee must provide the affidavit of<br/>Termination of Domestic Partnership or Dissolution of Marriage document.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent or probationary unit members in temporary assignments will have health,<br/>dental and vision benefits paid through August 31 immediately following their<br/>termination. Temporary unit members will have health, dental and vision benefits<br/>paid through June 30, the end of the school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time teachers who are absent on account of illness and who have exhausted<br/>their accumulated sick leave shall continue to receive full insurance coverage to be<br/>paid by the District not to exceed the remainder of the current school year and limited<br/>to one (1) school year only for the same illness.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide certificated employees on Board-approved leaves of<br/>absence the option to continue the District group plan of health insurance during the<br/>period of the leave. The employee shall reimburse the District for all premium costs<br/>of the insurance, monthly or quarterly, in advance, by the 25th.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide certificated employees retiring from the District the option to<br/>continue the District group plan of health insurance. The retiree shall reimburse the<br/>District for all premium costs of the insurance, monthly or quarterly, in advance, by<br/>the 25th.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher between the ages of 55 years and 65 years who elects to retire is eligible<br/>for continued medical insurance providing he/she has been employed by the<br/>Mariposa County Unified School District for at least eighteen (18) school years. The<br/>District will pay only the employee’s share of the insurance premium in effect at the<br/>time of the employee’s retirement during the time between ages 55 and 65. Coverage<br/>shall be in effect from the date of retirement and shall continue until he/she reaches<br/>the age of 65. The employee has the option to pay for the spouse’s coverage. If the<br/>District’s health carrier requires the District to pay a composite rate for retirees<br/>between the ages of 55 and 65, the retiree’s spouse may be covered under the same<br/>plan until the retiree reaches age 65, provided the premium does not exceed that of a<br/>current employee. Beginning July 1, 1997, this provision will apply to retired<br/>employees whose spouses were covered by the retiring MCUSD teacher’s medical<br/>insurance at the time the teacher retired.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees will be offered the same medical and dental benefits as active bargaining<br/>unit members per AB 528.</p>
<p>For unit members who retired in 2003/04 and previous years, the District will pay<br/>an amount equal to the cost of medical, prescriptions and BHA for the highest of<br/>the 3 plans currently being offered to active employees to be applied to the cost<br/>for retiree medical insurance until age 65. Any amount not expended by the<br/>retiree will be forfeited.</p>
<p>Unit members who retire in 2004/05 and beyond and who meet the 18 year<br/>requirement for fully-paid medical insurance, will be allowed an amount equal to<br/>the cost of the fully-paid plan for active employees (medical, prescription, BHP,<br/>dental and vision), to use in selecting health coverage. The amount allowed for<br/>purchase of retiree health coverage will be equivalent to the actual cost of the<br/>fully-paid plan for active employees as determined each year. Any amount not<br/>expended by the retiree will be forfeited.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Medicare eligibility age is increased, a retired teacher, who was<br/>otherwise eligible for District-paid medical benefits until age 65, may elect to<br/>purchase District group plan health insurance between age 65 and the age of<br/>Medicare eligibility, if allowed by the Districts health carrier.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who retire in the 1998/99 school year may have their retirement based on<br/>the salary of their highest paid year, or elect to receive Golden Handshake.</p>
<p>Teachers who retire in 1999/00 and future years will have their retirement based on<br/>the salary of their highest paid year.</p>
<p>The District will investigate offering Golden Handshake and implementation of the<br/>Rule of 85 should they be provided by legislation.</p>

<p>APPENDIX C</p>
<p>MARIPOSA COUNTY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>Mariposa, California</p>
<p>MARIPOSA COUNTY TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION<br/>COMPENSATION PLAN - DRAFT</p>
<p>The Mariposa County Unified School District wishes to provide its teachers with a total compensation<br/>package, salary and benefits, which will compete in a comparable market. This document<br/>represents a draft plan to implement a minimum salary of $34,000 for qualified teachers, to provide<br/>parity throughout the salary schedule, and to provide compensation for teachers that will enable the<br/>District to attract and retain teachers.</p>
<p>A. Development of a Competitive Salary Schedule</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District proposes that two MCTA negotiators be assigned to work with District staff to<br/>develop the model salary schedule. The model salary schedule would have the following<br/>characteristics:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encourage academic growth, e.g., greater emphasis will be placed on the increase between<br/>columns than the increase between steps.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase teaching skills and subject matter knowledge, e.g., approved units directly relate to<br/>better teacher performance or knowledge, unit requirements continue as the teacher<br/>advances through all steps.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encourage completion of a master’s degree.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encourage teachers to become fully credentialed. Steps for non-credentialed teachers will<br/>be limited and salary will remain under $34,000. A significant increase in salary should be<br/>provided when the teacher obtains their credential.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide parallel treatment throughout the schedule</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary schedule will be based on a five-unit increment and will include a $34,000 minimum<br/>salary for qualified teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary schedule will be developed working toward the concept that the top end of the salary<br/>schedule is twice the bottom end.</p>
<p>4. Development of a competitive salary schedule will utilize information from comparable school<br/>districts, based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparable districts will be identified and agreed upon based on geography, size<br/>and revenue limit. These districts have been agreed upon: Hughson Unified,<br/>Amador Unified, Gustine Unified, and Calaveras Unified.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparisons will include salary and health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary comparisons will include the lowest, mid-range and maximum salary</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>placements, number of service days, per diem amount, number of steps, degree<br/>requirements, step credit given for new hires, percentage of FTE receiving higher<br/>salaries at mid-range step, and step requirement for highest salary (longevity).</p>
<p>d. Health and welfare benefits comparisons will include the average district contribution<br/>for active and retired employees.</p>
<p>B. Budget Assistance</p>
<p>Two negotiators will be assigned to meet with the Director of Business Services during the year to<br/>discuss the budget.</p>
<p>The information contained in this draft plan is currently being reviewed by School Services of<br/>California and District staff and is not to be considered final. As discussed previously, the plan may<br/>be refined as part of interest-based bargaining.</p>

<p>MARIPOSA COUNTY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>CONTRIBUTION TO CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK</p>
<p>Name_Date</p>
<p>Social Security#_</p>
<p>It is my desire to participate in the Catastrophic Leave Program as specified in the agreement<br/>between MCUSD and MCTA. I understand that I must make an irrevocable donation of (1) sick<br/>leave credit (granted per Ed. Code section 44978) per year unless suspended pursuant to section 5<br/>of the Catastrophic Leave Agreement or by submitting a letter to the District between May 30th &amp;<br/>June 30th for the following year stating I wish to discontinue contributing days and to give up<br/>eligibility to request benefits from the MCTA leave bank. I understand that a committee of three<br/>MCTA members will be appointed by the executive board of MCTA who will meet with one<br/>representative of the District Office to review, approve or deny applications on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave will be considered for teachers who are experiencing catastrophic illness or<br/>injury and have exhausted all sick leave. Verification of illness or injury must be provided in a<br/>manner acceptable to the District. The teacher must have previously become a member of the leave<br/>bank. A teacher may be granted up to a maximum of 40 days in a fiscal year. The committee will be<br/>limited to granting only those days that are currently in the bank.</p>
<p>I hereby authorize the MCUSD payroll office to deduct one (1) nonrefundable sick leave credit per<br/>year for donation to the Catastrophic Leave Program.</p>
