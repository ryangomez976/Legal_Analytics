<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to sections 5.1 and 5.2 above, whether for<br/>membership dues or agency fee, the District agrees to promptly remit such monies to the Association,<br/>accompanied by an alphabetical list of bargaining unit members for whom such deductions have been<br/>made, categorizing them as to membership or non-membership in the Association, and indicating any<br/>changes in personnel from the list previously furnished.

<p>ARTICLE 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALARIES</p>

<p>6.0. 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When requested by either party, an ad hoc committee composed of representatives from the</p>
<p>District and MTA will meet to study all elements of total compensation with a proposal to be<br/>recommended as basis for negotiations.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State funded cost of living adjustment (COLA)</p>

<p>13.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall appoint an evaluator for each bargaining unit member and inform each<br/>bargaining unit member to be evaluated of his or her evaluator by the 20th day of service.<br/>The bargaining unit member may thereafter request the District to assign an alternate<br/>evaluator, but such a decision rests solely with the District. In the case of bargaining unit<br/>members assigned after the beginning of the school year, or in the event of a change in<br/>evaluators, such notification shall occur within thirty (30) calendar days of the assignment.</p>
<p>13.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall conduct at least two (2) classroom (or other site) observations for<br/>temporary and probationary bargaining unit members (and permanent bargaining unit<br/>members in “needs improvement” status.) The District shall conduct the first observation by<br/>the sixtieth (60th) day of service.</p>
<p>Permanent bargaining unit members in &quot;meets or exceeds expectations” status shall receive<br/>no less than one (1) classroom observation during the evaluation year, pro-rated<br/>appropriately.</p>
<p>13.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of probationary bargaining unit members and permanent bargaining unit<br/>members in a “needs improvement” status, and/or on an assistance plan, at least two (2) of<br/>such observations shall be pre-scheduled. This provision does not preclude nonscheduled<br/>classroom visitations and observations as an additional useful assessment technique, nor<br/>does it preclude classroom observations or visitations during a year in which the bargaining<br/>unit member is not being evaluated. Any observation which impacts a bargaining unit<br/>member's evaluation shall be written and provided to the bargaining unit member within a<br/>reasonable period of time, not to exceed twenty (20) school days. Written classroom<br/>observations shall include a notation of date, time in and time out.</p>
<p>13.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall provide the bargaining unit member with a copy of the observation report.<br/>Either the bargaining unit member or the evaluator may request a conference to discuss the<br/>observation and/or observation report prepared by the evaluator.

<p>13.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations shall not be used to harass a bargaining unit member. It is understood<br/>between the District and the Association that this section is an evaluation procedural<br/>requirement. Comments on the final evaluation may include comments and information from<br/>previous observations or other written evidence of bargaining unit member performance as<br/>related to Section 2.</p>
<p>13.2.9 Summary evaluations shall be in writing on the form attached hereto as Appendix D-1 and a<br/>copy thereof shall be transmitted to the bargaining unit member not later than thirty (30)<br/>calendar days before the last day of student attendance of the school year. A meeting shall<br/>be held between the bargaining unit member and the evaluator to discuss the evaluation,<br/>and such meeting shall be held prior to the end of the school year. If the evaluation reflects<br/>a “needs improvement” in any area, the meeting will be given priority and held within a<br/>reasonable period of time not to exceed twenty (20) school days from the date of delivery of<br/>the evaluation form to the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>13.2.10 All probationary bargaining unit members shall receive at least two (2) summative<br/>evaluations per year. All permanent bargaining unit members shall receive an evaluation<br/>during their third year of service and at least every fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) year thereafter. Summative</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Murrieta Valley Unified School District<br/>&amp; Murrieta Teachers Association<br/>July 1, 2011-June 30, 2014</p>
<p>evaluations will be written according to the criteria expressed in Appendix D-2. However, the<br/>District reserves the right to evaluate permanent bargaining unit members every year.</p>
<p>13.3 ASSISTANCE</p>
<p>13.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bargaining unit member's final evaluation reflects less than satisfactory performance in<br/>any area, he or she shall be evaluated the following year. The evaluator and the bargaining<br/>unit member shall meet and design specific recommendations for improvement of the<br/>bargaining unit member's performance. This assistance plan shall specifically address<br/>identified weaknesses and describe a process for improvement. The length or term of the<br/>Assistance Plan shall be determined on a case by case basis and shall reflect the nature of<br/>the assistance required. There shall be a conference at the conclusion of each assistance<br/>plan, as well as every six (6) weeks, at a minimum, while an assistance plan is in effect. The<br/>District may recommend or require a bargaining unit member who has received written notice<br/>of “less than satisfactory” performance to participate in a District provided program designed<br/>to improve appropriate areas of the bargaining unit member's performance. No assistance<br/>plan shall include a provision for mandatory bargaining unit member participation beyond the<br/>bargaining unit member's normal workday.</p>
<p>13.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall be notified within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed twenty (20)<br/>school days of the assignment of a bargaining unit member to an assistance plan unless the<br/>bargaining unit member involved specifically requests that the Association not be notified.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATION</p>
<p>13.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes the right of representation in employment relations provided under<br/>Government Code Section 3543.1 as that section is interpreted by PERB and courts of<br/>competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>13.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood by the District and the Association that this right currently includes the right of<br/>a bargaining unit member to have representation in any meeting with a person in a<br/>supervisory position which the bargaining unit members reasonably believes may lead to<br/>discipline or negative evaluation. Bargaining unit members shall not request and shall not be<br/>afforded Association representation at any classroom (or other site) observation.</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REBUTTAL</p>

If such response is filed, the<br/>evaluation document may be modified at the District's discretion.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association acknowledge that unusual circumstances (such as illness of either<br/>the evaluator or the bargaining unit member, or emergencies) may prevent compliance with the time<br/>limits set forth in this section; however, there will be adherence to the timelines within five (5) on-track<br/>days of the end of the unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>16.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;GRIEVANCE&quot; is a formal written allegation by a grievant that he/she has been adversely<br/>affected by a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the specific provisions of this<br/>Agreement. Actions to challenge or change the policies of the District as set forth in the<br/>rules and regulations or administrative regulations and procedures must be undertaken<br/>under separate legal processes. Other matters for which a specific method of review is<br/>provided by law, by the policy rules and regulations of the Board of Trustees, or by the<br/>administrative procedures of this District are not within the scope of this procedure.</p>
<p>16.1.2 A &quot;GRIEVANT&quot; may be any bargaining unit member or the Association.</p>
<p>16.1.3 A &quot;DAY&quot; is any day in which the administrative office of the Murrieta Valley Unified School<br/>District is open for business.</p>
<p>16.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR&quot; is the District-designated management employee who has<br/>immediate jurisdiction over the grievant, or who has been designated to adjust grievances.</p>
<p>16.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance will<br/>be filed in a separate grievance file, unless the grievance is denied at the final level of<br/>appeal, in which case the records will be transferred to the personnel file of the participant.</p>
<p>16.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to file and appeal the grievance in a timely manner shall be deemed a waiver of the<br/>grievance and bar further prosecution thereof.</p>
<p>16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INFORMAL LEVEL</p>
<p>16.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an informal<br/>conference with his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL I - IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR</p>
<p>16.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance,<br/>the grievant must present his/her grievance in writing on the appropriate form (Appendix E) to<br/>the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>16.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the contract provisions<br/>allegedly violated, the circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the informal<br/>conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>16.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall communicate his decision to the grievant in writing within ten<br/>(10) days after receiving the grievance. If the immediate supervisor does not respond within<br/>the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL II - SUPERINTENDENT OR DESIGNEE</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>16.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, he/she may within ten (10) days after<br/>receiving the decision submit a written request (Appendix E) to the Superintendent or<br/>designee for review.</p>
<p>16.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall communicate his/her decision to the grievant within ten<br/>(10) days after receiving the grievance. If the Superintendent or designee does not respond<br/>within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL III - MEDIATION</p>
<p>16.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, he/she may, within ten (10) days<br/>submit a written request (Appendix E) for mediation of the grievance. In this event the<br/>Association shall, within ten (10) days, submit to the California State Conciliation Service a<br/>written request for the immediate services of a mediator.</p>
<p>16.5.2 The function of the mediator shall be to assist the parties to achieve a mutually satisfactory<br/>resolution of the grievance. At the outset of this process, the mediator shall schedule a<br/>meeting at a mutually agreeable time for the purpose of resolving the matter through<br/>mediation. Mediation shall be limited to one day unless both parties agree to extend the<br/>mediation beyond one day.</p>
<p>16.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is achieved by means of this mediation process,<br/>both parties to the grievance shall sign a written statement to that effect, and thus waive the<br/>right of either party to any further appeal of the grievance.</p>
<p>16.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association have agreed that this level (Level III of this Grievance<br/>Procedure) may be waived by mutual agreement. If no satisfactory settlement is reached<br/>after Mediation, either party may appeal the grievance to the next level (Level IV).</p>
<p>16.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL IV - ARBITRATION</p>
<p>16.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association is not satisfied with the decision at Level III, the grievant shall within thirty<br/>(30) days after receiving the decision submit a written request (Appendix E) to the<br/>Superintendent or designee for arbitration.</p>
<p>16.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association decides to submit the grievance to arbitration, the Association and the<br/>District shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. The order of the striking shall be determined<br/>by lot.</p>
<p>16.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne equally by the District<br/>and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>16.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the issue or<br/>issues submitted to him/her. If the parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the<br/>arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written grievance and the answers<br/>thereto at each step.</p>
<p>16.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this<br/>Agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures of the District.</p>
<p>16.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written arguments, the<br/>arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties his/her award, which shall be binding.</p>

<p>MURRIETA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>EXTRA-DUTY STIPEND LANGUAGE</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stipend positions are contracted/assigned on a year-to-year basis. Positions will<br/>be renewed for the following year upon receipt of a year-end satisfactory teaching<br/>and extra-duty/stipend assignment evaluation.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All vacant extra-duty/stipend positions will be posted for ten (10) working days. Any<br/>position that opens during a season may be filled on a temporary basis by school<br/>administration until the season is concluded. These positions will be opened for the<br/>following season.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All extra-duty/stipend percentages are based on Step 1, Column A of the current<br/>teacher’s salary schedule. In cases of coaching movement from assistant to head<br/>coach within a single sport, placement will be at step guaranteeing an increased pay<br/>rate.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches of CIF playoff teams or individuals will be granted an additional 1/12 of<br/>their stipend amount for each week or any portion of a week or coaching time<br/>beyond the regularly scheduled season.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches will receive 1/60 of their extra-duty/stipend per day after two weeks of<br/>coaching during a December or April intersession. If the school calendar changes,<br/>this language will be open for revision.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra-duty stipends may be shared if all members involved and site administration<br/>are in agreement.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listed stipend does not necessarily guarantee its funding. However, the Site<br/>Leadership Team and District Office agree to work closely together to ensure that<br/>schools will have the necessary funding to provide quality programs. All stipend<br/>funding provided to the sites by the District must be utilized for contract-listed<br/>stipends.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers working off-track on curriculum and instructional activities will be paid at<br/>the daily, non-emergency credentialed teacher substitute rate.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Y-rating means the person in the extra-duty/stipend position will continue to receive<br/>their current rate of pay until they leave the position.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher release time may be substituted in lieu of hourly rate when SST meetings<br/>are held within the school day.</p>

<p>APPENDIX G</p>

<p>MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE MEASURES</p>
<p>First, there are norm-referenced tests, such as SAT 9. These tests measure the performance of students against<br/>the performance of other students within defined categories, using a constantly changing relative scale - all<br/>seventh graders in the Unified States, all seventh graders in California or all seventh graders in MVUSD. The so-<br/>called &quot;norms&quot; are statistically created for comparison groups. These &quot;norms&quot; are the references factored into the<br/>questions and potential outcomes. The results of these tests array schools and districts in the state within a<br/>matrix of categories. The results are reported by district, school, and grade level - not by teacher. AB 265<br/>specifically prohibits reporting results by teacher. The results of these tests are not a part of teacher evaluations.<br/>It is this group of tests that are widely known as &quot;standardized tests.&quot;</p>
<p>The next group of tests is criterion-referenced tests. These tests are those which measure student performance<br/>against an absolute scale -100 percent or 100 percent with a curve or 100 percent weighted in conjunction with a<br/>well-defined body of knowledge. Criterion-referenced tests are created through the prism of learning objectives<br/>and learning standards. Examples of such tests are the District assessment tests for writing (standards-based<br/>performance), English, language arts and mathematics (standards-based single answer). These criterion-<br/>referenced assessments were produced after deliberation by a number of teachers working on committees. The<br/>results of these tests do reflect on teacher performance within a framework of special circumstances that might<br/>apply to a teacher's class, such as student absences, cognitive levels of students, past student histories, English<br/>speaking abilities, etc.</p>
<p>Steady student progress or growth is the key, as reflected by assessment outcomes. This is basically common<br/>sense.</p>
<p>The third group of assessments is teacher generated. These assessments are really a form of criterion-<br/>referenced tests that are broader in scope and not necessarily pencil and paper. They can take the form of, but<br/>not be limited to, demonstrated physical performances - singing, presentation of a product - sculpture, term<br/>papers, projects, class pencil and paper tests, portfolios, teacher observation, and the results of programmed</p>
<p>instruction.</p>
<p>NEW TEACHER</p>
<p>Those teachers that were not employed with the Murrieta Valley Unified School District during the previous year’s<br/>new teacher in-service.</p>
<p>NEW SCHOOL SITE</p>
<p>A school site that was not in operation during the previous school year.</p>
<p>PRIOR TEACHING EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>A year of prior teaching experience for credit must equal seventy-five percent of the minimum 180 day teaching<br/>year required by California law. Only full-time teaching in grades K-12 or Special Education programs is<br/>accepted.</p>
<p>REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>Movement from subject area to subject area and/or grade level to grade level at the same work location.</p>
<p>STAFF DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>A course/workshop offered by the District.</p>
<p>TRAINING BEYOND BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S DEGREE</p>
<p>Accredited training beyond the Bachelor's or Master's Degree shall include only those courses taken after the date<br/>of issue of the Bachelor's or Master's Degree.</p>
<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>A documentary record of completed work certified by notarized signature or institutional seal and received by<br/>direct mail in the District Human Resources Office from an accredited institution.</p>
