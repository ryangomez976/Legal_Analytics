<p>8.2</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>It is recognized<br/>responsibilities</p>
<p>that the very nature of a unit member’s day-to-day professional<br/>does not lend itself solely to an instructional day of rigidly established<br/>length. It is recognized that time on task is a major variable affecting student<br/>achievement; therefore, both parties agree to exert every effort to make optimum<br/>use of the time allocated for each student’s instructional day. Psychologists will be<br/>on duty 714 houjrs per day, exclusive of the duty free lunch.</p>
<p>Instructional Minutes</p>

<p>19</p>
<p>substitute teacher will be compensated at a prorated amount of the<br/>standard substitute rate of pay. (Appendix C) This compensation will<br/>be paid in one warrant at the end of the school year in which it is<br/>accumulated. Should a teacher earn an equivalent of one day (6<br/>periods) during one year, that teacher could choose the option of<br/>having one compensatory day to use the following school year instead<br/>of being issued the warrant. That comp day would not be available for<br/>use immediately before or after holidays. That date may be disallowed<br/>should there already be a large number of substitutes scheduled.</p>
<p>Orjice the application for a comp day has been approved, the date may<br/>ncjt be withdrawn by the District.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13 - STANDARDS BASED EVALUATION PROCESS</p>
<p>13.1 General Information</p>
<p>13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process is designed to assist the unit member in</p>
<p>improving his/her performance and to acknowledge individual<br/>strengths. This can best be achieved in a supportive, cooperative<br/>atjmosphere. Ongoing informal classroom visits by the site<br/>aaministrator/primary evaluator throughout the year will foster this<br/>atpnosphere, and will complement formal classroom observations. The<br/>expectation is that administrators will devote as much time as needed<br/>to support unit members in their professional development.</p>
<p>Ttjie expectation is that a unit member will devote time for self-<br/>reflection and the improvement of her or his craft.</p>
<p>13.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tljie standards referred to in the following evaluation process are the<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession, as adopted by the<br/>California Commission on Teacher Credentialing for regular classroom<br/>teachers (Appendix 1-4). For school psychologists , the standards are<br/>thbse adopted by the National Association of School Psychologists<br/>(Appendix 1-5). For Speech and Language Pathologists (SLPs), the<br/>standards are those adopted by the American Speech-Language-<br/>Hbaring Association (ASHA) (Appendix 1-6). A copy of these standards<br/>ar|d their key elements, as well as a written explanation of the<br/>evaluation process, will be given to all unit members prior to<br/>implementation of this plan. Unit members new to the district will<br/>rebeive this information at the time of initial employment.</p>
<p>13.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation will be based upon data obtained from the unit member’s<br/>performance of all assigned duties and responsibilities. No evaluations<br/>wifi be based on a unit member’s political and/or organizational<br/>adtivities or preferences.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>13.1.4</p>
<p>13.1.5</p>
<p>13.1.6</p>
<p>13.1.7</p>
<p>13.1.8</p>
<p>13.1.9</p>
<p>The evaluation form will be prepared in triplicate, one (1) copy going to<br/>thie evaluatee, one (1) to the evaluator, and one (1) for the District<br/>personnel files. The evaluation will be signed by both the evaluator and<br/>the evaluatee. The signature of evaluatee indicates that the unit<br/>member has seen the evaluation, not agreement or disagreement with<br/>the evaluation.</p>
<p>Unit members will not participate in the evaluation and/or observation<br/>for evaluative purposes of other unit members.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be conducted by the site administrator for<br/>classroom teachers or district special education administrator for<br/>school psychologists and SLPs to whom the unit member is directly<br/>responsible. Although portions of the evaluation may be delegated to<br/>other administrators, the site administrator or immediate supervisor<br/>who is ultimately responsible for the final written evaluation will sign the<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>Unit members who are regularly assigned to work at more than one<br/>si|e will be evaluated by the administrator who is in charge of the<br/>pijogram in which the evaluatee works. Designated site administrators<br/>wjll also evaluate these unit members on the same basis as other unit<br/>members and will forward a copy of their evaluation to the program<br/>administrator for use in discussion with the evaluatee. A copy of the<br/>firjal evaluation will be forwarded to the site administrator where the<br/>unit member is working.</p>
<p>Inj the event a unit member has two (2) half-time assignments at two<br/>(2j) school sites, the two (2) site administrators and the unit member<br/>wjll mutually agree on which site administrator will complete the formal<br/>evaluation procedure. The second site administrator will complete an<br/>observation form and submit it to the site administrator completing the<br/>formal evaluation.</p>

<p>14.1 Definition</p>
<p>A transfer refers to movement of unit members from building to building and from<br/>District Program to District Program (a program is defined as a specialized<br/>instructional service other than that provided by the regular classroom teacher). A<br/>transfer may either be initiated by the unit member (voluntary) or initiated by the<br/>administration (Involuntary). (Appendix J)</p>
<p>14.2 Voluntary Transfer</p>
<p>Transfers andjchanges in assignments will be made on a voluntary basis whenever<br/>possible. In mjaking voluntary transfers the convenience and wishes of the unit<br/>member will b^ given consideration.</p>

<p>22.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will pay one hundred ninety-two dollars ($192) per year<br/>directly to CalPERS for each eligible retiree for medical insurance. In<br/>addition, the District will pay an amount sufficient to cover the single-<br/>only medical and dental premiums for the plans in which the retiree<br/>was enrolled at the time of retirement. Effective October 1,1994, the<br/>allocated amount will not exceed the cost of the successor CalPERS<br/>Medical and Delta Dental plans.</p>
<p>22.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payments listed in 22.1.2 above will be made for a maximum of<br/>ten (10) years or until eligible for Medicare, whichever comes first.<br/>When eligible for Medicare, the payment for medical will be reduced to<br/>an amount sufficient to cover the supplementary plan (the amount will<br/>not exceed the cost of Kaiser North or Blue Shield HMO); the District<br/>will continue to provide dental coverage for the retiree.</p>
<p>22.1.3.1 Should the retiree subsequently enroll in a more</p>
<p>expensive plan, the District’s obligation is limited to the<br/>lower amount identified in Section 22.1.2 above.</p>
<p>22.1.4 Because STRS requires that the CalPERS premiums be deducted<br/>from the retiree’s STRS check, the District will provide, in advance, a<br/>non-taxable reimbursement each quarter up to the amount designated<br/>in Section 22.1.2 above.</p>
<p>66</p>

For purposes of this section,<br/>sabbaticals and other approved leaves of absence will<br/>not constitute a break in service. Time spent on a<br/>sabbatical or other approved leave of absence will not be<br/>used in computing the five (5) year section.</p>
<p>22.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to deny granting or continuing a<br/>reduced workload for any unit member if doing so would create<br/>difficult staffing problems. The District shall make every reasonable<br/>effort to grant or continue the reduced workload.</p>

<p>Appendix 1-2</p>
<p>13.3.5</p>
<p>Process II - Possible Evaluation Methods for Alternate Plans</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Videotape or audiotape feedback. This method refers to the recording by the teacher of an actual, live classroom<br/>episode on video or audiotape. The focus could be on the teacher’s behavior or students’ reaction to the<br/>improvements to classroom instruction. Such recordings are powerful in that they allow the teacher to see them self<br/>from the students’ perspective. The teacher’s review of the taped records can involve the use of some data collection<br/>or observation instrument. For example, the teacher could chart frequencies of specified behaviors.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher maintained interactive journal. (A written journal in which a responder or responders, chosen by the<br/>evaluatee, provide regular written feedback on the evaluatee entries). Maintaining an interactive journal or thoughts,<br/>reactions, progress, etc. focusing on a particular student, class, or one’s teaching in general can be a valuable tool for<br/>self-reflection and professional growth. The focus of the interactive journal entries should be decided in advance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress through self-studv material. This method involves using some existing programmed materials for<br/>reviewing one’s teaching style or to investigate alternative teaching techniques and materials. The materials typically<br/>would involve some general introduction and then a set of modules to work through which required some kind of<br/>response from the teacher.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher maintained portfolios. Portfolios of lesson plans, instructional materials developed, student assessments<br/>used, or any other category of teaching products can be kept in a file and reviewed by the teacher as a way of<br/>constantly improving on what has been done or used. The purpose and criteria for including pieces in the portfolio can<br/>be maintained primarily for the self-reflective value to the teacher, a peer review of the content could also lead to some<br/>valuable insights.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaching. May include, but is not limited to demonstration lessons; providing release time to visit other classrooms;<br/>conference attendance, sample lesson plans; alternative strategies and techniques; support and encouragement; and<br/>responding to reasonable requests from the evaluatee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other methods as agreed to by the unit member and evaluator.</p>
