<p>1</p>
<p>The District recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative of all full-time<br/>and part-time certificated employees of the District - excluding management,<br/>confidential and supervisory employees, as defined in Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540 -<br/>3549 of the California Government Code - for the purpose of meeting and negotiating.<br/>The District Superintendent, Building Principals, and Counselors who serve in excess<br/>of 50% of their time in such capacity shall be considered management and not<br/>members of the bargaining unit.</p>
<p>No other group or organization or representative thereof shall be recognized or<br/>permitted to engage on behalf of any employee included in the bargaining unit in any<br/>activities concerning wages, hours, or terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p>The parties of the Agreement recognize that the duties and work performed by the<br/>certificated employees in the bargaining unit described above shall be performed by<br/>unit members. The District, with the approval of the Association, may hire specialists<br/>to support the instructional program in accordance with Ed Code.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings will be held at least four times per year (September, November, January,<br/>March) for the purpose of curriculum updates and staff development. If the district is<br/>involved in an ongoing staff development project that encompasses staff from the membership<br/>listed below, then the said staff development shall replace the monthly Curriculum/Staff<br/>Development Council.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership will be composed of two teachers from Hayfork Elementary School,<br/>two teachers from Hayfork High School, one teacher from Valley High School or<br/>Community Day School, one Board Member, both Principals, the Superintendent, and<br/>one CSEA member.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership for the teachers will rotate. Membership from Hayfork High School<br/>and Hayfork Elementary School will be chosen by the teachers at their respective<br/>schools. One new member is to be chosen each school year.</p>
<p>2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Curriculum/Staff Development Council will annually review Appendix E to<br/>recommend changes.</p>
<p>2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Curriculum/Staff Development Council’s recommendation for the school calendar<br/>covering the following year shall be presented to the Board of Trustees no later than the<br/>March Board Meeting.</p>
<p>2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that this procedure may not be construed to limit the right of the District<br/>to consult with any employee or the Association, or implement whatever curriculum it<br/>deems appropriate.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3 - ASSOCIATION ACTIVITY</p>
<p>The District will not discriminate against any employee because of his/her membership<br/>in the Association or his/her activity on behalf of the Association.</p>
<p>The Association may use the school mailboxes, faculty room bulletin board, and the<br/>District electronic mail services.</p>
<p>All Association business, discussion and activities will be conducted by unit members<br/>or Association officials outside the classroom instructional program. Occasional use of<br/>a unit member's preparation period or non-classroom instructional time may be<br/>necessary.</p>
<p>The Association may request the use of district facilities when such use will not<br/>interfere with school programs or community activities which have prior approval.</p>
<p>The Association may use office and technology equipment and telephones. All<br/>Association long distance telephone calls shall be paid by the Association.</p>
<p>The District shall provide the Association informational packets regarding Board of<br/>Trustees meetings, including minutes of the preceding meeting, adopted budget and<br/>monthly budget summaries.</p>
<p>The District, upon request by the Association, agrees to furnish to the Association,<br/>within ten (10) days, all available information in existing public documents concerning<br/>the financial resources and certificated and classified staffing of the District. In<br/>addition, such information, by request of the Association, shall be supplied via diskette.</p>
<p>The Association, as a whole, shall be entitled to up to six (6) days of leave per year at<br/>no loss of salary or benefits. In years when the entire contract is being negotiated, the<br/>Association, as a whole, shall be entitled to up to nine (9) days of leave per year with<br/>no loss of salary or benefits.</p>
<p>3.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association shall notify the Principal of such leave at least three (3)</p>
<p>days in advance whenever possible.</p>
<p>3.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of a substitute teacher for the absent teacher(s) shall be paid by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Any employee who is a member of the Association, or who has applied for<br/>membership in the Association, may sign and deliver to the District as assignment<br/>authorizing deduction of unified membership dues and general assessments. Pursuant<br/>to such authorization, the District shall deduct one tenth (1/10) of such dues from the<br/>regular salary check of the employee each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for<br/>the teachers who sign such authorization after the commencement of any school year<br/>shall be prorated to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to authorization of the<br/>employee, whether for membership dues or other fees, the District agrees to promptly<br/>remit such monies to the appropriate governing body accompanied by a list of<br/>employees for whom such deductions have been made and indicating any changes in<br/>personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>
<p>Upon appropriate written authorization from the employee, the District shall deduct<br/>from the salary of any teacher and make appropriate remittance for annuities, credit<br/>union, savings bonds, insurance programs or any other plans or programs jointly<br/>approved by the Association and District.</p>
<p>The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the<br/>provision of this Article.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5 - CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>The parties recognize that class size is (1) a significant factor in pupil achievement; (2)<br/>an important term of condition of employment; and (3) a major cost variable, subject to<br/>staff availability, physical facility limitations, student transportation problems, special<br/>pupil needs, the grade level and/or subject and other factors. For these reasons, the<br/>parties affirm this intention to consider class size as a matter of mutual importance and<br/>consideration.</p>
<p>With the exception of Physical Education, Work Experience, Drama and Music (Band<br/>and Chorus), the total number of pupils per teacher shall not exceed at the high school<br/>156 enrolled students per teacher.</p>
<p>The ratio of pupils to classroom teacher at the 4<sup>th</sup> - 8<sup>th</sup> levels will not exceed thirty (30)<br/>pupils per teacher, with the exception of split grade classes, in which the ratio will not<br/>exceed 28 to 1. The ratio of pupils to classroom teacher at the K-3 level will not exceed<br/>25 pupils per teacher, with the exception of split grade classes, in which the ratio will<br/>not exceed 23 to 1. If the pupil per teacher ratio exceeds 30 to 1, or 28 to 1 in split-<br/>level classes for grades 4<sup>th</sup> - 8<sup>th</sup>, or 25 to 1 or 23 in split-level classes for grades K-3,<br/>the Board and administration will make every reasonable effort to rectify the situation<br/>within 20 working days. The teachers over the maximum will have the assistance of a<br/>temporary aide.</p>
<p>The criteria for establishing the maximum number of student work stations for a<br/>specific class are: space, enrollment, safety, type of class and the equipment and<br/>furniture physically present, and each constitutes a controlling factor in the<br/>establishment of student work stations.</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an area in which the student has sufficient room and</p>
<p>adequate ventilation and heat to perform the required learning tasks.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for safety shall be determined by the activities involved in a<br/>particular class and the nature of the potential hazards present.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount and type of equipment and furniture physically present shall<br/>be determined by the equipment needed to provide proper instruction.</p>
<p>5.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt to maintain the actual number of students in all</p>
<p>classes below the maximum level.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>5.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum Numbers: The Principal will not assign students</p>
<p>above this number without consultation and dialogue with the Instructors)<br/>at the affected grade level privately before the assignment. Each<br/>additional student will require a separate conference. An observer of the<br/>Instructor's choice may be present at such conference. A decision will be<br/>made by the Building Principal with input from the Instructors at the<br/>affected grade level. If consensus is not reached, the Building Principal<br/>will have the final decision.</p>
<p>5.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High School Maximum Numbers: The Principal will not assign students<br/>above this number (Appendix E) until a conference is held with the<br/>Instructor. If this conference does not resolve the problem, a committee<br/>consisting of the Principal, the Instructor in the affected department, and a<br/>unit member of the Instructor's choice, will meet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>An agreement will be made by the Building Principal and the affected<br/>department. A decision will be made by the Building Principal with input<br/>from the affected instructors and department. If consensus is not reached,<br/>the Building Principal will have the final decision.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6 - TRANSFER/ASSIGNMENT/RE-ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer refers to any action that results in the movement of a teacher from one<br/>school to another. A re-assignment refers to any change in grade level or assignment to<br/>another subject matter area. A transfer may be teacher-initiated (voluntary) or District-<br/>initiated (involuntary). A vacancy is a newly created or vacated position within the<br/>unit after transfers/re-assignments have been made.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Superintendent has the authority to transfer teachers.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer of an employee shall not result in a reduction of the teacher's salary,<br/>seniority or any fringe benefit.</p>
<p>SECTION 1 - VOLUNTARY TRANSFER</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To another position: Prior to the last teaching day in March of each school year,<br/>teachers may apply for transfer to another position. Teachers desiring transfer shall<br/>request placement, in writing, through the Building Principals, stating their reasons for<br/>transfer. The request shall then be sent to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a vacant position: The Superintendent shall deliver to the Association and each<br/>teacher by name, post in all school buildings a list of the vacancies for any promotional<br/>positions or new positions, which occur during the school year and for the following<br/>school year upon knowledge of the vacancies. The list shall contain a closing date for<br/>submitted requests for transfer which is at least ten (10) working days following the<br/>posting date. No assignment to fill vacancies shall be made until after the closing date.<br/>The District shall notify all teachers' during summer recess of any posted openings,<br/>which may arise during the summer. Each teacher will provide their summer address if<br/>it is different than their regular address. If a teacher already has a transfer application<br/>on file, it is not necessary to make a further application in order to be considered for<br/>any vacancies for which the teacher may have applied</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No outside applicant shall be selected to fill a vacancy if there is a unit member<br/>applicant that meets the qualifications of the job description.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of selecting which unit member shall be voluntarily transferred and<br/>/or re-assigned in order to meet the needs of the District, the District shall consider the<br/>training, experience, major and minor fields of study, credential, length of service in<br/>the school and in the District, past evaluations, advanced degrees and other criteria as<br/>listed in the job posting.</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two or more teachers have equal qualification, the decision shall be based upon<br/>District-wide seniority. A teacher's seniority is established by the initial date of service<br/>to the District. Those teachers whose first day of service to the District is the same<br/>shall have their seniority established by lot. The District shall conduct the lottery in a<br/>fair, equitable and reasonable manner with Association representatives present. Once a<br/>teacher's seniority has been established by lot, such seniority date shall remain with that<br/>teacher as long as that teacher is employed by the District.</p>
<p>6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever an employee's request for transfer is denied, the District Superintendent<br/>shall, upon request, and within three (3) days, give such employee a written statement<br/>of the reason(s) for such denial. The teacher shall then be granted, upon request, a<br/>meeting with the Administrator denying the request to discuss the reasons for the<br/>denial. The teacher may be accompanied by a representative of his or her choice.</p>
<p>SECTION II - INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS/REASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent maintains the right to assign certificated employees to positions<br/>based upon qualifications, enrollment, specialized services, opportunities for<br/>performance improvement and the educationally related needs of the District. If the<br/>District determines that all the items referred to in the prior sentence are equal, then the<br/>least senior teacher shall be reassigned. Employees being assigned to a different site<br/>shall be given reasons in writing for such assignments. Employees may request<br/>assignment to one of the posted vacancies.</p>
<p>6.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary transfer shall not be made arbitrarily or capriciously. It may be made<br/>for the following reasons: A decrease in the number of pupils which requires a<br/>decrease in the number of unit members, class size considerations, elimination of<br/>program(s), decreased funding, change in school configuration or school closing. Such<br/>transfers will be subject to annual review, upon the request of the teacher.</p>
<p>6.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the unit who is to be involuntarily transferred/reassigned shall be<br/>informed by the Superintendent or designee, in writing, of the reason or reasons for the<br/>transfer. If the involuntarily transferred/reassigned unit member so requests, a<br/>conference shall be held between the unit member, an Association member chosen by<br/>the teacher, and Superintendent or designee prior to the effective date of the<br/>transfer/reassignment. The unit member may request the site principal’s attendance at<br/>the conference. This committee will render a written recommendation to the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>6.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a change of enrollment or funding requires a decrease in staff or departmental<br/>personnel at a particular school or within a particular funded program, the District shall<br/>seek volunteers prior to making any involuntary transfers. If an involuntary transfer<br/>becomes necessary, the qualified teacher with the least seniority shall be transferred.</p>
<p>9</p>

In<br/>the event of an occurrence after this date, such as death, resignation, leave of absence,<br/>change of curriculum, change in enrollment, change in funding, or other unforeseen<br/>circumstances, transfers and reassignments may be made or changed by the District as<br/>it determines necessary. In the event of such a change, the District will notify<br/>employees, in writing, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>All teachers reassigned or transferred to a grade not taught within the past 2 years or if<br/>taught in the past 2 years and the curriculum has made a major change will be given up<br/>to five (5) days during the first year of their new assignment for the purpose of<br/>visitations, professional growth, meetings with mentors, planning, or the development<br/>of curriculum materials. These days are to be taken during non-school time when<br/>possible and the teacher would be compensated at the current hourly rate.</p>
<p>6.15.1 When a teacher is transferred/reassigned during the school year, a plan</p>
<p>will be developed with that teacher and site administrator. This plan may<br/>include substitute time, compensatory time, or compensation at the extra<br/>service hourly rate.</p>
<p>If a member requests that his/her applications for transfer/reassignment be kept<br/>confidential, the principal at her/his school shall not be notified by the District of the<br/>application until after an opening has occurred.</p>
<p>Unit members returning from a leave shall be afforded all rights provided under this<br/>section.</p>
<p>If a non-classroom position within the bargaining unit is created or becomes available,<br/>each teacher and the Association will be notified and that position will be posted in a<br/>conspicuous place with deadline dates for making application. The deadline dates shall<br/>not be less than ten (10) working days after the posting. A final assignment to any such<br/>position shall not be made until after the deadline date.</p>
<p>Teachers who are transferred may receive orientation in curriculum and management at<br/>the discretion of the site administrator, or upon request of the teacher. The<br/>administrator and teacher will meet to develop a plan.</p>
<p>10</p>

<p>necessary specialized health care procedures.</p>
<p>The Teachers shall report unsafe conditions to the Principal. The Principal or his/her<br/>designee shall promptly investigate the unsafe condition, and if he/she concurs the<br/>condition is unsafe, he/she shall take appropriate action to correct the condition.</p>
<p>Any case of verbal or physical assault upon a teacher in the performance of the<br/>teacher's duties shall be promptly reported to the Superintendent or his/her<br/>representative.

<p>8.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Time</p>
<p>8.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time teachers of Grades K-12 shall have the equivalent of one period<br/>of preparation time each day, unless at the employee option he/she chooses<br/>to teach during his/her preparation period. &quot;Preparation time&quot; is defined as<br/>time when the class is not normally present in the classroom and/or under<br/>the classroom teacher's supervision. Preparation time for each teacher<br/>shall be assigned by the Administration prior to commencement of the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>8.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the district has made a reasonable effort to find a permanent preparation<br/>teacher and has been unsuccessful, the affected employee shall be<br/>compensated at the Certificated Hourly Rate for their preparation time.</p>

<p>8.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last day of school before Thanksgiving, Christmas Vacation, Spring Break and the<br/>final day of school shall be an early release day for teachers.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>8.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum days and/or early release days may be used for teacher collaboration, student<br/>study teams, contact with parents, staff development, and other areas that directly<br/>involve student performance and expectations.</p>
<p>One half of the minimum days and/or early release days will be for staff use. Each<br/>team or department will develop a plan that reflects student needs, as recognized by the<br/>team and the administration.</p>
<p>One half of the minimum days and/or early release days will be for staff development<br/>use or any other area that directly involves student performance and expectations. This<br/>use will be determined by administration.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 9 - EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed by the parties that the principle objective of evaluation is to<br/>improve the quality of instruction in the District. The Teacher Evaluation Instrument<br/>(Appendix A) meets this objective</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Board of Trustees to be in compliance with Education Code<br/>Sections 44660 Seq.</p>
<p>A. EVALUATION OF TEACHING ASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary employees shall be evaluated by the site principal or a District<br/>administrator at least twice each school year. If an additional evaluation is needed, an<br/>independent outside evaluator may be selected upon mutual agreement of the<br/>Association and the District.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent employees shall be evaluated by the site principal or District administrator<br/>at least once every other year. If an additional evaluation is needed, an independent<br/>outside evaluator may be selected upon mutual agreement of the Association and the<br/>District. On non-evaluation years, permanent employees shall be required to submit<br/>goals and objectives by November 1 that year.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employees covered under the terms of this Agreement shall be formally evaluated<br/>in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the end of the first quarter, the Principal and unit member shall</p>
<p>meet to review the basis upon which the employee is to be evaluated. The<br/>following items shall be the basis for the discussion during the pre¬<br/>evaluation conference:</p>

The process of evaluation is<br/>best served when the evaluator and the evaluatee have a mutual understanding of the<br/>goals and objectives of evaluation. The evaluator will clearly state their expectations<br/>of the workplace environment and the lesson observed.</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the class of the new employee within the first</p>

<p>ARTICLE 10 - PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the District that all instruction shall be fair, accurate, objective,<br/>appropriate to the age and maturity of the students, and sensitive to the community<br/>needs and the needs and values of our diverse cultures and heritages. Academic<br/>freedom is essential to the fulfillment of this policy and the district acknowledges the<br/>fundamental need to protect teachers from any censorship or restraint which might<br/>interfere with the teacher’s obligation to pursue truth in performance of their teaching<br/>functions. Accordingly:</p>
<p>10.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher shall have reasonable freedom in the classroom presentations<br/>and discussions and may introduce political, religious or otherwise<br/>controversial material, provided that said material is relevant to the course<br/>content and within the scope of the law.</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing teaching functions, teachers shall have reasonable freedom<br/>to express their opinions on all matters relevant to the course content in an<br/>objective manner. A teacher, however, shall not utilize his/her position to<br/>indoctrinate students with his/her own personal, political or religious<br/>views.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal life of a teacher is not an appropriate concern of the district for purpose of<br/>evaluation or disciplinary action unless it prevents the teacher from performing his/her<br/>assigned duties.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher shall be entitled to full right of citizenship. No religious or political<br/>activities, or lack thereof, shall be used for purpose of evaluation or disciplinary action<br/>unless said activities violate local, state or federal law.</p>

<p>17.3.3 below.</p>

<p>The District will consider: 1) restorations to full-time teaching positions<br/>before creating any new part-time positions; 2) reassignment of teachers<br/>who have been transferred to other schools either full or part-time back to<br/>full-time in the school to which they were originally assigned.</p>
