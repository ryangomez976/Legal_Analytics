<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size averages for each 7-12 teacher shall be calculated at P-1. Any teacher with an average<br/>class size of 33 students will be provided $30 per section for the purchase of instructional<br/>materials or other curriculum related/equipment. Any teacher with an average class size of 34<br/>students will be provided $50 per section for the purchase of instructional materials or other<br/>curriculum related materials/equipment. Any teacher with an average class size of 35 students<br/>will be provided $70 per section for the purchase of instructional materials or other curriculum<br/>related materials/equipment. These amounts are not cumulative. P.E., band, choral, dance,<br/>leadership and work experience sections shall not be considered in the average and payments<br/>shall not be made for such courses.</p>
<p>B. Grade Range staffing formulas will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade Ranges are:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9-12 comprehensive high schools</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7-8 junior high schools</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-6 elementary schools</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8-12 continuation high schools and opportunity classes</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staffing formula for a site or grade range, excluding Endeavor, is the projected average<br/>enrollment for the site or grade range multiplied by the number of students periods divided by<br/>the number of teacher periods divided by class size. The staffing for K-6 schools will use<br/>District-wide enrollment. The staffing for 7-12 schools will use school site enrollment. The<br/>resulting number equals the number of FTE’s required at that site or grade range (FTE’s will<br/>include teachers assigned to regular classrooms with regular student rosters and will not include<br/>nurses, librarians, counselors, and non- teaching periods for the activity director and athletic<br/>director).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following factors will be used for the initial staffing formula:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the comprehensive high schools (grades 9-12): student periods = 6 (allowance will be<br/>made for additional 0/7 optional periods and CSR), teacher periods = 5, class size = 30.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the junior high schools: (grades 7-8): student periods = 7, teacher periods = 6, class size<br/>= 30.</p>
<p>-16-</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elementary schools district wide (grades K-6):</p>
<p>i) . for classes participating in the state class size reduction program, student periods = 1,<br/>teacher periods = 1, class size = consistent with state funding guidelines.</p>
<p>ii) . for classes not participating in class size reduction: student periods = 1, teacher periods =<br/>1, class size = 30.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For continuation high schools and opportunity classes: student periods = 4, teacher periods<br/>= 6, class size = 21.</p>
<p>C. If changes to any of the factors in the staffing formula are desired at one site, including any</p>
<p>alternative/block schedule, the following process will be used.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site staff discusses the desired change and makes every effort to reach consensus. During<br/>consensus building all viewpoints will be discussed. If consensus cannot be reached, a 2/3<br/>majority will move the process to the next level.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the decision is reached at the site, that decision with minority opinions represented will be<br/>taken to the Superintendent for discussion at the district level. If any changes/clarification<br/>needs to be addressed, these will be communicated to the site.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a decision is reached at the site, that decision with minority opinions represented will be<br/>taken to the Association for discussion. If any changes/clarifications need to be addressed,<br/>these will be communicated to the site.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussions at the District and Association levels are complete, the proposed changes will<br/>proceed to formal negotiations.</p>

The site<br/>administrator shall be notified by the employee prior to the exchange period. Such arrangements<br/>shall not impact other leaves set forth elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjunct duties are considered to be part of a unit member’s professional obligation at grades 7-12.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For grades 9-12, by the start of the unit member’s first work day a list of adjunct duties will be<br/>made available and unit members will be allowed to choose the three they wish to perform. In<br/>the event that an adjunct duty is selected by more than one unit member, the duty will go to the<br/>unit member with the most seniority at the CUSD comprehensive high schools. If, after the end<br/>of the unit member’s last work day, before the start of the first student day of the school year, a<br/>unit member does not choose three adjunct duties they may be assigned. A unit member must<br/>be given notice at least 10 workdays in advance to change an assigned adjunct duty. Unit<br/>members may volunteer for, but will not be assigned duties during weekends, holidays, or<br/>vacation periods. Unit members will have the option of having other unit members cover their<br/>duties by mutual agreement among the unit members involved.

If, after the end of the unit member’s last work day, before the start<br/>of the first student day of the school day of the school year, a unit member does not choose<br/>nine hours worth of site supervision or adjunct duties they may be assigned. A unit member<br/>must be given notice at least 10 workdays in advance to change an assigned adjunct duty. Unit<br/>members may volunteer for, but will not be assigned duties during weekends, holiday, or<br/>vacation periods.

By the start of the unit member’s first work<br/>day, a tentative year-long schedule of site supervision duties will be made available to unit<br/>members. With prior notice to the site principal, unit members will have the option of<br/>exchanging site supervision duty assignments by mutual agreement among the unit members<br/>involved. The minutes delineated above do not include activities in which the teacher is<br/>supervising his/her own class (e.g., escorting students to and from class at the beginning or end<br/>of the school day, to and from lunch, recess or physical/music education, or supervision during<br/>rainy day schedule) or minutes that the teacher volunteers to supervise students outside the duty<br/>schedule. Subsection P3 shall be effective with the 2013-2014 school year; however, the District</p>
<p>-25-</p>
<p>shall make a good faith effort to bring sites into alignment with this subsection upon execution<br/>of this Tentative Agreement.</p>
<p>Q. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice during the school year unit members may be asked to return to “Open House” or “Back to<br/>School” night functions. Each unit member’s attendance will be required. These events will end no<br/>later than 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>R. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In lieu of” time is defined as the performance of substitute service by (K-12) employees during<br/>their assigned preparation periods, or before or after their normal teaching day, in exchange for in<br/>lieu of time off.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time off for such service shall be granted on a period for period basis up to a maximum of 18<br/>periods, or three (3) full days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu of time may be granted in portions of one period or more upon application to and<br/>approval by the principal. If denied, the principal will provide a written explanation to the<br/>employee. Under normal circumstances in lieu of time will not be granted during the first or<br/>last week of each semester, nor during the first or last week of a track.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance of in lieu of time service shall first be solicited on a voluntary basis. In the event<br/>that no volunteer can be found, employees may be equitably assigned on an occasional basis to<br/>perform in lieu of time service.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated in lieu of time may be transferred from one employee to another. The site<br/>administrator shall be notified by the employees prior to this transfer. Such arrangements will be<br/>handled in the same manner as exchange days.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XT</p>
<p>JOB SHARING/PARTIAL CONTRACT</p>
<p>Although the District believes that full-time certificated employees are in the best interest of the</p>
<p>District’s educational programs, the following types of contracted positions may be instituted at the</p>
<p>District’s discretion.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet District personnel needs, any two permanent certificated employees who want to share a<br/>single contracted position or one permanent certificated employee who wants to work a partial<br/>contract, may do so with the consent of the District and the site administrator. Participants’<br/>workdays will be scheduled and arranged by the site administrator. Participants shall be required to<br/>work half of the student days plus the first and the last student day of each school year.<br/>Participants shall be required to work the six (6) teacher work days/buy back days. For example,<br/>during a 180 day school year, a participant would work 90 days (including either the first or last<br/>student day) plus one day (either the first or last student day) plus the 6 work days/buy back days for<br/>a total of 97 days.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each participant will take part in all scheduled activities that apply to him/her on his/her assigned<br/>days. This includes, but is not limited to, school committees, staff meetings; lesson planning, extra<br/>duty schedules, testing, workshops, and in-service sessions which would be applicable to a<br/>certificated employee in the same position on a full-time basis. Job Share participants will conduct<br/>parent conferences jointly.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each participant will be responsible for all official records including attendance, progress reports,<br/>report cards, and reports on pupil progress toward academic standards. (Stull Bill)</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a job share participant be unable to fulfill his/her teaching obligation for any reason that<br/>may include, but is not limited to, death, illness, or resignation, the other participant shall assume<br/>full-time responsibility where possible until a suitable substitute can be employed.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any certificated employee who shares a position with another certificated employee shall enjoy any<br/>and all rights and privileges normally enjoyed by a full-time certificated employee. The district will<br/>pay fringe benefits at the employee only rate. All job-sharing participants will be paid at the same<br/>salary level as a full —time certificated employee of the same experience and education with the<br/>exception that they will receive a percentage of the gross pay equal to their portion of the job. Year<br/>for year step advancement and professional growth requirements will apply the same as if they held<br/>a full-time position. Job share employees will accrue sick leave at a prorated share proportionate to<br/>the employee’s percentage of full-time.</p>
<p>Any certificated employee who holds a partial contract position will be paid at the same salary level<br/>as a full-time certificated employee of the same experience and education with the exception that<br/>they will receive a percentage of the gross pay equal to their portion of the position he/she holds.<br/>The district will pay fringe benefits for partial contracts of 50% or more at the employee only rate.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing and/or partial contract positions exist on a year-to-year basis at the District’s discretion.<br/>Conditions of the position may be renegotiated yearly.</p>
<p>-29-</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a job sharing partnership or a partial contract position is discontinued, the<br/>participants may remain at the same school, or be transferred to another school, at the District’s<br/>discretion. Criteria for the decision of teacher placement will be teacher request, available job<br/>vacancies, seniority, credential and experience, school and program needs, and district need.</p>
<p>Teachers in a discontinued job share/partial contract will be eligible for full time employment if they<br/>were once full time employees, and an appropriate full time vacancy exists.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide legally required reasonable accommodation for a permanent teacher who can<br/>not find a permanent employee within CUSD to job share/partial contract, the District may employ<br/>a qualified credentialed candidate in a temporary, one year job share/partial contract. All other<br/>sections of A above and sections B-F will apply.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Voluntary transfer” shall mean the movement of a certificated employee from one work<br/>location to another work location at a different site with the certificated employee’s agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Involuntary transfer” shall mean the movement of a certificated employee from one work<br/>location to another work location at a different site without the certificated employee’s<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Voluntary reassignment” shall mean placement in another department (grades 7-12 or<br/>departmentalized settings), track, or grade level (grades K-6 or self-contained setting other than<br/>special education) at the same location with the certificated employee’s agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Involuntary reassignment” shall mean placement in another department (grades 7-12 or<br/>departmentalized settings), track, or grade level (grades K-6 or self-contained setting other than<br/>special education) at the same location without the certificated employee’s agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Vacancy” shall mean any vacated or newly created position that requires a job posting to fill as<br/>determined by the District (after internal site movements have been completed).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiating requests for transfer or reassignment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Transfer request” — in order to be considered for transfer (to a new location), a certificated<br/>employee must submit an application through the District’s application process. (See sections E<br/>and F below).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reassignment requests” — by January 15<sup>th</sup> of each year, each site administrator will email site<br/>staff for the purpose of seeking employee reassignment preferences (“reassignment requests”)<br/>at the site for the following school year. Such “reassignment requests” — shall be made in writing<br/>by January 31<sup>st</sup> to the site administrator. The decision to grant or deny the written request(s)<br/>shall be at the sole discretion of the site administrator. In the event that a position is posted, a<br/>certificated employee at a school site may use the process in section B1 to apply for a vacancy at<br/>their current site.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentialing, district-wide seniority and program needs will be the primary factors considered<br/>in deciding a voluntary transfer request or reassignment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers and reassignments</p>
<p>1. District and/or program needs may determine the necessity for involuntary transfers or<br/>reassignments.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to executing an involuntary transfer and/or reassignment, the following procedures shall</p>
<p>be followed:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee being transferred and/or reassigned will be contacted in person by<br/>their last workday of the current school year, except when filing summer vacancies. If the<br/>certificated employee cannot be contacted in person or by telephone, a registered letter will<br/>be sent.</p>
<p>Should an involuntary reassignment notification occur after the last workday of the current<br/>school year, the affected employee shall be granted three (3) hours at the curriculum<br/>participant hourly rate. Should an involuntary reassignment occur within one (1) week prior<br/>to or after the start of the student school year, the affected employee shall be granted either<br/>six (6) hours at the curriculum participant hourly rate or one (1) release days.</p>
<p>Should an involuntary transfer notification occur after the last workday of the current school<br/>year, the affected employee shall be granted six (6) hours at the curriculum participant hourly<br/>rate. Should an involuntary transfer occur within one (1) week prior to or after the start of<br/>the student school year, the affected employee shall be granted either twelve (12) hours at<br/>the curriculum participant hourly rate or two (2) release days.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting between the employee and the site administrator will occur prior to executing an<br/>involuntary transfer or reassignment. The certificated employee being involuntarily<br/>transferred and/or reassigned shall be given reasons for the transfer and/or reassignment in<br/>writing at the time the transfer and/or reassignment is initiated. The employee may request<br/>a meeting with the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel or designee if the reason(s)<br/>provided are unacceptable to the employee.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate credential, special State authorizations, program needs, and District-wide<br/>seniority will be factors in deciding which certificated employees should be involuntarily<br/>transferred and/or reassigned.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee shall have the right to indicate a preference for any vacancies that<br/>exist at the time of the transfer and/or reassignment.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final decision for the transfer and/or reassignment shall be the responsibility of the<br/>administration.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an involuntary transfer or reassignment is necessitated after the first teacher work day due<br/>to changes in student enrollment, District-wide seniority will be the primary factor<br/>considered when deciding which certificated employee should be involuntarily transferred<br/>and/or reassigned, given that the certificated employee must be appropriately credentialed<br/>for the new position. Credentialing and program needs will be the secondary factors<br/>considered.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers and reassignment shall not be arbitrary or capricious, but will be made in</p>
<p>the best interests of students and staff.</p>
<p>- 35-</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective for K-6 staffing beginning 2015-16 school year, members who have been<br/>involuntarily transferred or reassigned shall not be subject to involuntary<br/>transfer/reassignment for the following year unless credentialing or enrollment needs<br/>leave no other alternative.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective for K-6 staffing beginning 2015-16 involuntary transfer/reassignments for K-<br/>6 will be limited to a change of three grade levels up or down from the current grade level<br/>(e.g. 1<sup>st</sup> grade teacher may not be transferred higher than 4<sup>th</sup> grade) unless, upon the<br/>principal’s recommendation, the move is approved by the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Personnel or District Level Designee.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers shall be as per A and C of this article with the following exceptions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees being involuntarily transferred shall be notified two months prior to the first day<br/>of their new teaching track whenever possible.

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of pupils toward the standards established by the governing board at each grade<br/>level in each area of study. The standards are to be made available to the evaluator and the<br/>evaluatee. The evaluation and assessment of a certificated employee’s competence, pursuant to<br/>this section, shall not include the use of publisher’s norms established by standardized tests.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s adherence to curricular objectives.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the<br/>employee’s responsibilities.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final decision on whether to grant a Sabbatical Leave shall be made by the<br/>Superintendent/designee.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide the Association with copies of Sabbatical Leave application forms<br/>(Education Code 44966, 44967, 44968, 44969, 44970, 44971, and 444972)</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-Service Leave (Paid Leave)</p>
<p>1. A certificated employee shall be entitled to one (1) day of paid leave each school year for the<br/>purpose of improving his/her performance. Such leave may be used to visit classes in other<br/>schools, or to attend educational workshops related to his/her assignment. Principal approval is<br/>a prerequisite for granting this leave (Education Code 44962 and 44963).</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty Leave (Paid Leave)</p>
<p>1. The District will pay his/her salary each time a certificated employee is called for jury service<br/>(Education Code 44036) upon receipt of jury duty service verification. If the certificated<br/>employee is released from jury duty prior to noon, that employee shall return to his/her assigned<br/>work site but not necessarily to his/her individual classroom. Jury duty service fees, minus<br/>transportation, shall be remitted to the District.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Leave</p>
<p>1. Association representatives shall have a total of five (5) days of paid leave to utilize for local,<br/>state, or national conferences, or for conducting other business pertinent to Association affairs.<br/>These representatives shall be excused from school duties upon two (2) days advance</p>
<p>notification to the superintendent by the Association president. The Association shall pay for<br/>any substitutes needed, as determined by the site principal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association president and/or negotiations chairperson shall have a total of ten (10) half<br/>(1/2) days of paid leave to be used for Association business (Education Code 44962 and 44963).</p>

<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange Teaching Programs</p>
<p>The District may or may not participate in recognized Teacher Exchange Programs. Teachers<br/>interested in such participation must meet the basic criteria established by such programs.</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>In the event a certificated employee, spouse, child or member of the immediate household<br/>experiences a catastrophic illness or injury which exhausts all other sick leave or fully paid time<br/>off, except extended illness leave, he/she (or appropriate representative) may apply for a<br/>catastrophic illness leave by obtaining a physician’s verification and submitting the verification to<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Committee chairperson.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate the<br/>employee for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates a member of the employee’s<br/>family which incapacity requires the employee to take time off work from work for an extended<br/>period of time to care for that family member, and taking extended time off work creates a<br/>financial hardship for the employee because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave,<br/>other fully paid time off, and ten (10) days of substitute deduction. (Education Code 44043.5.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Catastrophic Leave Committee, composed of the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel, the<br/>chairperson; an administrator of the applicant’s school; the president of CUTA; and the<br/>chairperson of the CUTA collective bargaining team shall determine eligibility and procedures.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any district certificated employee may anonymously donate day(s) of his/her accumulated sick<br/>leave to an eligible employee on a case-by case basis. All transfers of eligible leave credit are<br/>issued to a specific individual, are irrevocable and must be in full workday increments. Donors<br/>will be notified of days used and unused days will be returned.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who receives paid leave pursuant to this section shall use any leave credits that he<br/>or she continues to accrue on a monthly basis prior to receiving paid leave pursuant to this<br/>section (Education Code 4043.5)</p>
<p>Q. Paid Leave Restrictions</p>
<p>Employees on paid leave, other than sabbatical, may not accept remuneration from another source.<br/>Jury duty is not considered a paid leave as the amount of pay is forwarded to the District.</p>
<p>- 63-</p>
<p>Therefore, if a question arises as to Code provisions, the Education Code will prevail. In cases<br/>where the Education Code authorized the District to provide guidelines, this Agreement shall be the<br/>guideline.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XX</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL GROWTH PLAN (TEPS)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ceres Unified School District encourages certificated employees to maintain and improve their<br/>professional qualifications. Professional growth should be so constituted that it shows a balanced<br/>growth in the teaching majors and teaching competencies, or is specifically related to the assignment<br/>for which one was hired or to which one has been appointed. Principals may recommend courses in<br/>other areas such as teaching minors.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification of Professional Growth Credit</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official verification of completed work must be submitted to the Personnel Office prior to<br/>October 1 of any given year to qualify for Professional Growth Credit for salary schedule<br/>placement for that year. Official verification includes official transcripts, originals of official<br/>grade cards, or official/original verifications of completion.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility for submitting all completed forms and verifications lies solely with the<br/>certificated employee. If official verification of completion of courses is not presented to the<br/>Personnel Office by October 1, the units will not be lost, but must be carried over to the next<br/>salary year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior approval for professional growth credit may be obtained by submitting a request to the<br/>Teacher Education and Professional Standards Committee (TEPS), composed of a minimum of</p>
<p>five (5) certificated employees, who will review staff requests for professional growth and<br/>provide recommendations to the superintendent for his/her decision.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may submit course-work for professional growth credit without having submitted a<br/>TEPS form for prior approval if all of the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units submitted are upper division or graduate units, which may be extension or Continuing<br/>Education Units, non-repetitive, from an accredited institution, accredited by the appropriate<br/>regional accrediting agency.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Course-work is clearly relevant to the teaching assignment, major or minor, or the current<br/>credential requirement of the certificated employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six (6) or fewer units at any one time are taken during the teaching calendar. Coursework taken<br/>during summer of off-track time is not limited.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A TEPS form for prior notification must be submitted if coursework exceeds six (6) units at any<br/>one time during the teaching calendar. This would include summer or off-track courses overlapping<br/>with the teaching calendar.</p>
<p>E A TEPS form for prior approval must be submitted if:</p>
<p>1. Junior college or lower division coursework is being taken to fill a special need.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A course is being repeated for a special reason.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is any question as to direct relevance of the coursework to teaching assignment, current<br/>teaching credential or major or minor.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coursework is undertaken leading to a new credential or additional advanced degrees.</p>
<p>G. Certificated employees at step F-14 or higher on the salary schedule will receive five hundred sixty-<br/>six dollars ($566) for acquiring four (4) semester units within any three (3) consecutive year period<br/>of time. This amount is to be paid one time only during any three (3) year period. Request for<br/>payment of this money must comply with B-l, C, and D above.</p>

<p>CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS</p>
<p>A. Effective September 30, 2013, the District will contribute $630.00 per month ($7,560 per year) for<br/>all full time unit members toward the purchase of District approved insurance plans.</p>
<p>In the event that the lowest premium employee only medical insurance plan offered to employees<br/>exceeds the amount in the above paragraph, the District agrees to increase the contribution in the<br/>above paragraph to an amount equal to the cost of that plan, effective on the date of the increase.<br/>Should the increase raise the employee only cost of the lowest premium medical plan above $700.00<br/>per month ($8,400 per year), the District may, at its discretion, elect to reopen negotiations on this<br/>article instead of increasing its contribution above $700.00 per month ($8,400 per year) for all full<br/>time unit members, toward the purchase of District approved insurance plans.</p>
<p>The District may, at its discretion, increase the District’s contribution level. The District will give<br/>employees advanced notification of this contribution increase prior to open enrollment.</p>
<p>Effective with the Open Enrollment period for coverage in the 2008 calendar year, each eligible<br/>employee shall be required to enroll in the District-selected health and welfare program. However,<br/>the District shall permit an eligible employee to opt out of the District’s medical health and welfare<br/>program if the eligible employee can provide sufficient proof to the District of other group health<br/>insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the paragraph above, employees hired on or after January 1, 2012, may not opt out<br/>of medical coverage if this enrollment provision is required by the District’s healthcare plan<br/>provider.</p>
<p>If, during open enrollment, a unit member selects medical, dental, or vision, insurance coverage<br/>which costs more than the per month District contribution listed above, the unit member will be<br/>responsible for the additional costs.</p>
<p>If the cost for District offered medical, dental, or vision, insurance coverage exceeds the District<br/>contribution level for insurance benefits, then the unit members will be responsible for the<br/>additional costs over the District contribution level. Any administrative fees charged by the<br/>District’s healthcare plan provider will be incorporated into insurance rates approved by the District.<br/>If any change in these administrative fees is proposed after rates are set, the District agrees to meet<br/>and confer with CUTA to determine how these increases will be assessed. The District will meet<br/>and confer with the bargaining unit before making any change to the District contribution to<br/>employee benefits for bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>Unit members for whom the District contributes less than the per month District contribution listed<br/>above for District offered medical, dental, and vision insurance will receive the difference or use that<br/>amount to purchase District approved plans (e.g. cancer; disability or additional life insurance; 403<br/>(b) or 457 deferred compensation tax shelter or other plans as allowed under IRS rules, subject to<br/>minimum contribution requirements of the plan provider(s) etc.) or receive cash in lieu of benefits.</p>

<p>- 71 -</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective December 1, 2004, the District contribution level for a unit member working a shared or<br/>partial contract of 50% or more shall be proportional, (for example a 60% contract receives a 60%<br/>benefit) of a full-time unit members as specified in “A” above, for medical, dental, vision and life<br/>insurance. If a unit member working a shared or partial contract of 50% or more chooses medical,<br/>dental, and vision insurance which cost the District less than 50% of the District contribution<br/>specified in A. above, they will receive the difference or use that amount to purchase District<br/>approved plans (e.g. cancer; disability or additional life insurance; 403 (b) or 457 deferred<br/>compensation tax shelter or other plan as allowed under IRS rules, subject to minimum<br/>contribution requirements of the plan providers) etc.) or receive cash in lieu of benefits.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When making adjustments to the District contribution, the calculated amount will be rounded to the</p>
<p>nearest whole number, i.e. .5 or more will be rounded up to the next highest whole number, less<br/>than .5 will be rounded to the next lowest whole number.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide a minimum of $50,000 in life insurance for full-time unit members. The<br/>cost of providing the first $10,000 of this benefit will not be included in the calculations to<br/>determine the average monthly district contribution per bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective December 1, 2004, the District will contribute up to 50% of the amount provided for<br/>full-time unit members as specified in “A” above, for medical, dental, vision and life insurance for all<br/>certificated employees and their dependents beginning at age 50 to age 65 who retired after June 30,<br/>1986 and are vested in the District. Employees who retired prior to June 30, 1986, retired after June<br/>30, 1986 without becoming vested, or who are over 65, may continue to participate in the District<br/>insurance program at the retiree’s cost.</p>
<p>Certificated employees are vested in the Ceres Unified School District retiree benefit program after<br/>ten years of paid service, of which five years must be immediately prior to retirement. Any<br/>certificated employee participating in the Ceres Unified School District retiree benefit program shall<br/>be required to participate in the District’s health and welfare program for the entire school year<br/>immediately prior to retirement and shall be required to maintain continuous enrollment in the<br/>retiree benefit program.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee has completed an entire year of service, benefits coverage will continue to<br/>complete the twelve-month calendar. Twelve-month employees who leave the district must<br/>continue to contribute their portion of the benefit cost after receiving their final check.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who leave paid status in the final month of the employment year will be considered<br/>to have earned a full year of benefits.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may participate in the District’s Insurance Committee, which will make<br/>recommendations to the Superintendent regarding the selection of plans for vision, dental, medical<br/>and life insurance.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee must be vested and be on Column D (or higher) of the salary<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee must have reached the age of fifty-five (55) years prior to the first<br/>day of the next certificated employees’ work year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee shall notify the District superintendent of his/her intention to<br/>retire no later than April 15 of the last year of employment.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum base salary for determining the Retirement Incentive pay for any certificated<br/>employee may not exceed the top of the certificated salary schedule, including the master’s<br/>degree. The base salary is die certificated employee’s present placement on the certificated<br/>salary schedule. This does not include extended contracts and extra duty pay.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No certificated employee who is to receive a Retirement Incentive payment may accept a<br/>teaching, counseling, or school administrative position in any school district in California.<br/>Substituting and short-term contracts allowed by the S.T.R.S., and not affecting S.T.R.S.<br/>retirement payments, are accepted. If this provision is violated, the amount of the<br/>Retirement Incentive payment paid to the certificated employee shall be returned to the<br/>Ceres Unified School District within six (6) months, and subsequent payments shall be<br/>terminated.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTICE: Such incentive payments will not be considered by the California State Teachers’<br/>Retirement System in determining compensation for retirement benefit payment purposes.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of the Retirement Incentive Payment</p>
<p>a. The total amount to be paid to the certificated employee from the Retirement Incentive<br/>Program is a single sum determined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty (50) percent of his/her current base salary as explained in 1-d for retiring at age 55.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-five (35) percent of his/her current base salary for retiring at age 56.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five (25) percent of his/her current base salary for retiring at age 57.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manner of Retirement Incentive Payments</p>
<p>- 74-</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee may elect to receive the Retirement Incentive payment in October<br/>of the following fiscal year, or receive the Retirement Incentive payment in installments.</p>
<p>The amount and date of such installments will be designated by the certificated employee.</p>
<p>In this way, the retiree can prevent reception of monies in excess of the amount authorized<br/>by STRS from public school employment in any fiscal year. The total of the Retirement<br/>Incentive payments shall be made within five (5) years of the retirement date.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of the death of the retiree, the unpaid portion of the Retirement Incentive payment<br/>shall be paid to his/her estate, devises, or legatees.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the prerogative of limiting the number of certificated employees, according<br/>to budget constraints, who may retire under this article in any single year. If more<br/>certificated employees apply than, by District decision, can be accommodated, those granted<br/>retirement under this Article shall be selected by seniority, unless a certificated employee<br/>with seniority waives his seniority rights in favor of another certificated employee with less<br/>seniority.</p>

The employee shall not be<br/>entitled to a public hearing. The procedure entitled “Administrative Adjudication”<br/>commencing with Government Code 11500 shall not apply to any such hearing before the<br/>Governing Board or a hearing officer. Neither the Governing Board nor a hearing officer<br/>shall be bound by rules of evidence used in California courts. Informality in any such</p>
<p>- 96-</p>
<p>hearing shall not invalidate any order or decision made or approved by the hearing officer or<br/>the Governing Board.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time before an employee’s appeal is finally submitted to the Governing Board or to a<br/>hearing ofticer for decision, the District may serve on the employee and file an amended or<br/>supplemental Notice of Disciplinary Action.
