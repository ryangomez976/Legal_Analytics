<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of fulfilling the intent of (a) above, &quot;full-time<br/>teacher&quot; shall be defined as a teacher whose assignment in<br/>the District calls for him/her to render five (5) regular<br/>teacher work days of service per week to the District during<br/>the school year.</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total sick leave earned in any one year shall be calculated<br/>to the nearest one-fourth (1/4) of an hour.</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unused sick leave upon the retirement of any employee<br/>shall be credited toward retirement based upon a formula of</p>

Such<br/>statement shall be delivered to employees no later than<br/>November 15.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are absent from the duties to which_they have<br/>been assigned by the District because of illness or accident,<br/>shall receive their regular full pay for each day and/or<br/>period of such absence insofar as such teachers have<br/>credited and/or accumulated sick leave in their accounts to<br/>cover said absence.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may, for reasonable cause, require a<br/>physician's verification of illness. If such verification is<br/>required, the cost of the physician's services shall be borne<br/>by the District and the physician may be of the District's<br/>choosing.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave account of a teacher shall be charged for<br/>each day or actual teaching period during which he/she is<br/>absent because of illness or accident, whether or not a<br/>substitute is employed in his/her place.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When absences are of five (5) consecutive workdays or<br/>more in duration, the District may require verification of<br/>suspected abuse of sick leave, including any of the<br/>following procedures:</p>

An exception<br/>to this provision may occur if the position is no longer in existence,<br/>in which case the teacher shall be assigned to a position which is<br/>substantially equivalent to the one previously held.</p>
<p>In addition to the exception listed in 12.13 .4 above, any teacher<br/>who has been on parental leave for sixty (60) or more working<br/>days and gives notification of his/her desire to return to active<br/>employment after April 30, of the regular school year, may be<br/>continued on the parental leave until the commencement of the<br/>next school year.

<p>ADDENDUM F: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIDE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LETTER</p>
<p>SIDE LETTER REFERENCE BETWEEN<br/>CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND<br/>DINUBA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree pursuant to Education Code Section 45028 [stats.<br/>1996, c. 959 (S.B. 98) section 1], the parties can agree to a salary schedule in which placement is<br/>not strictly governed by a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience.</p>
<p>The District and Association further agree that Government Code Section 3543.2<br/>subdivision (e) allows the parties to negotiate the salary schedule for certificated employees<br/>based on criteria other than a uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience.</p>
<p>The District and Association further agree that in some circumstances, qualified<br/>candidates may be lost because of strict application of the uniformity requirements.</p>
<p>The District and Association further agree that both parties realize the potential benefit of<br/>qualified teachers who have prior teaching experience with Dinuba Unified School District to<br/>return to full-time employment with the District after a break in service.</p>
<p>In light of the authority granted by Education Code Section 45028 and Government Code<br/>Section 3543.2, the District and Association hereby agree, notwithstanding Article 15.3 of the<br/>current collective Bargaining Agreement which allows credit for previous teaching experience<br/>up to six (6) years, that a teacher hired by Dinuba Unified School District for full-time<br/>employment on or after July 1, 1996, who has previous teaching experience with Dinuba Unified<br/>School District, will be given full credit for all the years of prior teaching experience earned at<br/>Dinuba Unified School District. Applicants for teacher vacancies who have prior teaching<br/>experience at Dinuba Unified School District will be considered for employment pursuant to<br/>Board Policies and District procedures, and will not be treated preferentially in the screening<br/>process.</p>
<p>The District and Association agree that to be eligible to receive any credit for experience<br/>obtained at another District, the teacher must have less than six (6) years of prior teaching<br/>experience with Dinuba Unified School District, and in such instances, the employee may<br/>receive no more than six (6) years total service credit.</p>
<p>This Agreement is applicable to teachers who previously worked for Dinuba Unified<br/>School District and return to full-time employment with the District after July 1, 1996, following<br/>an absence from employment with the District of more than 39 months. (Education Code<br/>Section 44931.)</p>
<p>Dinuba Unified School District</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>2013-2016 Agreement</p>
<p>Example 1: A teacher works four (4) years with Dinuba Unified School District and then leaves<br/>to work at another district for four (4) years. Upon this teacher's return to full-time employment<br/>with Dinuba Unified School District after July 1, 1996, the teacher receives full credit for the<br/>four (4) years with Dinuba Unified School District and two (2) years credit for work at the other<br/>district, for a total of six (6) years [i.e., when full credit for Dinuba experience is added to outside<br/>service credit the maximum amount of combined credit shall not exceed six (6) years].</p>
<p>Example 2: A teacher works twelve (12) years for Dinuba Unified School District and then<br/>leaves the Dinuba Unified School District to teach at another district for three (3) years. The<br/>teacher returns to work at Dinuba Unified School District in a full-time position after July 1,<br/>1996. Upon his or her return to Dinuba Unified School District, the teacher receives credit for<br/>the full twelve (12) years of prior teaching experience at Dinuba Unified School District.<br/>However, the teacher is not eligible to receive any credit for the three (3) years served with the<br/>other district since the teacher has already received more than six (6)years credit based on<br/>Dinuba experience alone.</p>
