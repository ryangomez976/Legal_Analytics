If the supervisor<br/>denies consent the reasons for denial shall be given in writing to the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a unit member is on the five year schedule and the immediate supervisor<br/>feels the need to withdraw their consent, notice and a written statement of<br/>reasons shall be provided to the unit member in a timely manner before re¬<br/>starting the evaluation process.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this provision shall be interpreted to limit, modify, add to, change,<br/>or otherwise restrict the rights or obligations of either the District or the<br/>employee pertaining to notices, procedures or process required by the<br/>California Education Code governing the discipline, dismissal and release of<br/>certificated employees.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct of Hearing</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of the request for hearing, the District shall immediately contact the<br/>State of California Office of Administrative Hearings to contract for services of an<br/>administrative law judge appointed by that office to conduct the hearing.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence<br/>and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence<br/>on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious<br/>affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might<br/>make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions.</p>
<p>Page 14 | 39</p>
<p>Hearsay evidence may be used for the purposes of supplementing or explaining<br/>other evidence, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it<br/>would be admissible over objection in a civil action. The rules of privilege shall be<br/>effective to the extent that they are otherwise required by statute to be recognized<br/>at the hearing. Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision of the Hearing Officer</p>

<p>5. Compensatory Time Off</p>
<p>Teachers may receive compensatory time or compensation for providing substitute service<br/>during their preparation period or for supervising an additional group of students during<br/>their scheduled instructional time, based on the following guidelines:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers can accumulate an unlimited amount of compensatory (comp) time<br/>during the school year;</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unused comp time, above the two-day maximum, will be paid off at the<br/>applicable hourly rate set by dividing the teacher’s current salary (Class and Step)<br/>by the total contract days (Currently 186 for 2012-13 school year and dividing that<br/>by 6 hours on June 30<sup>th</sup> of each of each year (Class 1, Step 1, divided by 186 days,<br/>divided by 6 hours) on June 30<sup>th</sup> of each year;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may submit time earned for payment at any time during the year, based<br/>on procedure for submitting extra time;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comp time is earned by serving during a preparation period in grades 7-12 and by<br/>prorated increments of 1/6 of a day at grades K-6;</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At grades K-6, comp time is earned by a teacher supervising 50% of another class<br/>for all or a prorated portion of the day, multiplied by 50% of the applicable hourly<br/>rate or comp time formula; Note: K teachers will not be asked to sub of a session<br/>opposite their assignment.</p>

<p>6. Home School Teaching Stipend</p>
<p>Teachers may apply for an extra assignment beyond their regular teaching assignment to<br/>teach students in the Home School. A stipend will be paid to the teacher for each student they<br/>are responsible for. The stipend amount will be based upon the teacher’s full time salary on the<br/>salary schedule divided by 186 days divided by 6 hours per day. The stipend will be prorated by<br/>the number of days the student is enrolled for the school year. For example, a teacher at Class V,<br/>Step 22 will receive a stipend of $2436 for a student who was enrolled for the 180 days.<br/>(73,471/186/6 = $65.83/hour x 37 weeks = $2436). Formula is based upon one hour a week per<br/>student. If the student is enrolled for less than 180 days, the stipend will be prorated as to how<br/>many days enrolled divided by 180. Assignment of students will be based upon seniority of<br/>teacher. If a real and compelling reason exists to conclude that the incoming students would not<br/>perform well when paired with the next teacher in line for assignment, the principal will assign</p>
<p>Page 20 | 39</p>
<p>the student the next teacher (based on seniority) who meets the needs of the student. Teachers<br/>will be paid mileage to visit the student. Mileage will be based upon the teacher’s assigned<br/>workplace to the student’s home and back.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibility</p>
<p>The Superintendent is responsible for the transfers of all certificated personnel within the<br/>District to satisfy instructional staff bal ance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publication of Vacancies</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit vacancies which occur between November 1 and June 30th of the current<br/>school year, and which are not part of unresolved involuntary transfers, will be<br/>posted. These positions may be filled from internal applicants.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions set forth above, notices of vacancies shall remain posted<br/>for at least five (5) working days in the District administration office, school site<br/>main offices, and staff rooms at each site. Vacancy notices shall be posted as soon<br/>as the District determines that a vacancy exists and shall include the position<br/>description and location, grade level or subject matter assignment, credential and<br/>other special requirements.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District shall publish vacancies through the mass email of District accounts.<br/>Teachers wishing to be informed of vacancies which occur during the summer shall<br/>make their request in writing to the Superintendent and provide a self-addressed<br/>envelope or internet email address. This request shall be submitted no later than<br/>the last workday of the school year. The date the notice of vacancy is post<br/>marked shall be considered the date of notification.</p>
<p>4. Voluntary Transfers</p>

This request shall be<br/>submitted within five working days of the publicizing of the notice of vacancy in-<br/>house. During the summer, notice of intent to request voluntary transfer may be</p>
<p>Page 25 | 39</p>
<p>communicated by phone to the Superintendent to be followed by a written request<br/>for the transfer. The telephone notice or written request must be received within<br/>five (5) workdays of notice of the vacancy.</p>

In a non-evaluation year, or after a written evaluation has been given<br/>in an evaluation year, other substantive documentation may be used to justify an<br/>involuntary transfer to improve performance. No unit member shall be<br/>involuntarily transferred for arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory reasons.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written notice of an involuntary transfer, and specific reasons when requested by<br/>the unit member, shall be given to the unit member during a conference with the<br/>originator of said change prior to implementation of the involuntary transfer. A</p>

A certificated<br/>employee employed for less than five school days a week shall be entitled, for a<br/>school year of service, to that proportion of ten days' leave of absence for illness or<br/>injury as the number of days he/she is employed per week bears to five school days<br/>per week. Pay for any day of such absence shall be the same as the pay which<br/>would have been received had the employee served during the day. Credit for leave<br/>of absence need not be accrued prior to taking such leave by the employee and such<br/>leave of absence may be taken at any time during the school year. If such employee<br/>does no take the full amount of leave allowed in any school year under this section,<br/>the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year. At the beginning of<br/>each school year, each employee shall be notified of the balance of accumulated<br/>sick leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term governing extended sick leave shall not apply to the first ten days of<br/>absence on account of illness or accident of any such employee employed five days<br/>a week or to the proportion of ten days of absence, to which such employee<br/>employed less than five days a week, is entitled hereunder on account of illness or<br/>accident.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon return to work, the employee will sign a statement attesting to the nature of<br/>the illness or injury. The Superintendent may require such proof of illness or injury<br/>as she/he deems appropriate.</p>
<p>4. Extended Sick Leave</p>
<p>When a teacher is absent from his/her duty on account of illness or accident for a period of<br/>five school months or less, whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of<br/>employment of the employee, the amount deducted from the salary due him/her for any<br/>month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum which would have been paid<br/>to a substitute had one been employed.</p>
<p>5. Maternity Leave</p>
<p>a. An employee may use paid sick leave for temporary disability related to pregnancy<br/>or childbirth. Expectant mothers who wish to absent themselves from duty for<br/>reasons other than actual physical disability prior to and following childbirth shall<br/>be granted uncompensated maternity leave.

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for maternity leave shall be submitted in writing addressed to the<br/>Governing Board and delivered to the Superintendent at least two calendar months<br/>prior to desired commencement date of the leave or by February 15th, if a leave is<br/>being requested for the following school year and such need is known by February<br/>15th.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter from the employee's physician certifying the employee is pregnant and the<br/>expectant date of birth of the child shall accompany the request for leave or in the<br/>case of the adoptive parent a letter from the adoption source certifying the adoption<br/>and the fact that the employee has the primary responsibility for child care.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee's request for leave shall specify the inclusive dates the employee<br/>desires to have the leave.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may adjust the inclusive dates of the requested leave to coincide with<br/>natural breaks in the school calendar.</p>
<p>6. Maternity Disability Leave</p>
<p>This leave commences with the onset of disability due to pregnancy unless the employee<br/>is on a Board-approved uncompensated leave. The employee may claim sick leave pay<br/>and/or extended disability pay for no more than that limited period of time when the<br/>employee's physician certifies in writing that she was actually physically disabled to<br/>perform in her duties because of pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth, and the<br/>recovery there from. It is not intended to provide for a period of rest prior to or following<br/>childbirth or for child care. At the earliest possible date the employee shall give notice to<br/>the District of expected birth. An employee shall continue to work until such time as her<br/>physician deems that her physical inability to perform her duties require the<br/>commencement of leave.</p>
<p>7. Jury Duty</p>
<p>An employee shall be entitled to leave without loss of pay for any time the employee is<br/>required to perform jury duty. The District shall pay the employee the difference, if any,<br/>between the amounts received for jury duty and the employee's regular rate of pay. A meal,<br/>mileage, and/or parking allowance provided the employee for jury duty shall not be</p>
<p>Page 30 | 39</p>
<p>8.</p>
<p>considered in the amount received for jury duty.<br/>Sick Leave Allowed for Personal Necessity</p>
<p>a. An employee may use, at his/her election, during any school year, not more than<br/>their annual allotment of sick leave in the case of personal necessity without<br/>providing the specific reason. The employee shall not be required to secure<br/>advance permission for leave taken for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. Death or serious illness of a member of his/her immediate family.<br/>Immediate family means mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, or any<br/>grandchild of the employee or of the spouse of the employee and the spouse,<br/>son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother or sister of the<br/>employee, step-parents or step-children, foster parents and children, or any<br/>relative living in the immediate household of the employee.</p>
<p>2. Accidents involving his/her person or property, or the person or property of<br/>a member of his/her immediate family.</p>
<p>b. The Superintendent, at her/his discretion, may require proof of all personal<br/>necessity requested after the employee has used their annual allotment of leave<br/>days.</p>
<p>c. In order to be granted leave for personal necessity, other than for the type shown<br/>above, the employee shall request such leave from his/her site Principal. The<br/>Principal may grant leave without pay or may allow use of sick leave days for the<br/>leave. If the employee is not satisfied with the response from the Principal, a<br/>written request for leave may be submitted to the Superintendent for review. In<br/>emergency situations where a request in advance is not possible, approval for leave<br/>taken may be given subsequent to the leave.</p>
<p>d. Except in cases of emergency, twenty-four hours prior notice shall be given to the<br/>site administrator who shall approve or deny the leave, based on district or school<br/>needs, and/or limit the number of employees who may use this leave on any one<br/>day.</p>
<p>e. The changes approved in May 2014 are in effect for one school year only. Near<br/>the end of the 2014-15 school year the negotiations team will review the data, and<br/>make recommendation to the Board to continue this practice.</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a teacher is absent from his/her duties on account of an industrial accident or<br/>illness, he/she shall be paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any month in<br/>which the absence occurs as, when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity<br/>under Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code will result in a payment to<br/>him/her of not more than his/her full salary otherwise payable for period of<br/>disability.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the<br/>employee shall be entitled to only the amount of unused sick leave due him/her for<br/>the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the employee shall be<br/>entitled to sick leave and extended sick leave. If the employee continues to receive<br/>temporary disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much of his/her<br/>accumulated sick leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability<br/>indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the employee may endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of his/her industrial<br/>accident or illness.

At least one of the teachers must be tenured and both teachers must<br/>mutually agree to work together. Teachers must submit either their request,<br/>including their plan and calendar for such an assignment, to the Superintendent<br/>or designee by March 15 of the preceding school year or their request to<br/>dissolve an existing assignment.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers requesting a shared assignment shall be informed of the status of their<br/>proposal by April 30.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Employment</p>
<p>A. Discontinued Agreements</p>
<p>Voluntary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee-dissolved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes voluntary</p>
<p>transfer/reassignment based on availability of positions.</p>
<p>Involuntary - Management-dissolved agreement becomes involuntary<br/>transfer/reassignment for amount of current contract percentage of position or<br/>greater.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers will be assigned a proportionate share of instructional days and<br/>adjunct duties. Principal must allow or require both teachers to be present at<br/>annual parent conferences.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teachers shall attend open house and back-to-school programs, and may<br/>be expected to attend staff meetings and other professional activities.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teachers will assume full responsibility for the class’s instructional<br/>program. They will meet regularly to jointly develop lesson plans and ensure<br/>clear lines of communication with parents/guardians.</p>

<p>Page 37 | 39</p>
<p>school year.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teachers are expected to work the contracted days of district “buy-back”<br/>staff development and the contracted days of district “pre-service” activities.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever one of the teachers sharing an assignment is absent, the other<br/>teacher sharing the assignment shall make every reasonable effort to perform<br/>substitute teaching duties. Days served in this capacity will not count towards<br/>service credit referenced in 5.G. of this article.</p>
<p>5. Salary. Leaves. Heath and Welfare Benefits</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher will receive their prorated salary according to their individual<br/>placement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher will be compensated, at their individual daily rate of pay, for the<br/>contracted “buy-back” days, contracted “pre-service” days, and first day of a<br/>new school year, if not part of their work calendar.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any stipend earned by individuals in a shared contract will be paid as a full<br/>stipend, not prorated.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shared contract participants, substitute pay will be based on the<br/>professional rate and conditions agreed to in the CEA-CUSD contract.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All “leave” days authorized in the CEA-USD contract will be applied on a<br/>prorated basis, sing the percentage of contracted instructional days. Full days<br/>will be rounded off, not to exceed the numbers of days granted a full-time<br/>equivalent.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be one full District contribution available for Health and Welfare<br/>Benefits for the set of shared contracts equaling one Full time Equivalent<br/>bargaining unit member position. The partners may decide on the distribution<br/>of this contribution. For example, one partner may have 100% and the other<br/>may have 0% or 50/50 or any other portion not to exceed 100%. Any decision<br/>between partners must be unanimous. If a unanimous decision cannot be<br/>reached between the partners, the District will offer a pro-rated portion of the<br/>District contribution according to percent of assignment contracted. In no<br/>case, will the District pay more for benefits than it would for a full-time<br/>equivalent in the shard position.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals will advance in “longevity steps” on the District salary schedule<br/>by obtaining at least 75% of a year’s service credit. Employees working on a<br/>partial or shared contract working 75% or more of any given school year shall<br/>receive a full year’s service credit. Employees working less than 75% in a<br/>school year shall continually accrue service credit for annual salary</p>
<p>Page 38 | 39</p>
