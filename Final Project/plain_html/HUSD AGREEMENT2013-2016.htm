<p>ARTICLE IV: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE RELATING ONLY TO</p>
<p>CONTRACT DISPUTES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this article is to provide a procedure for the consideration of<br/>grievances pertaining to a Contract dispute which is defined as an alleged violation,<br/>misapplication or misinterpretation of the specific provisions of the Contract by a<br/>bargaining unit member or the Association.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grievance procedure applies only to items covered in this Contract.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member may present grievances relating to a Contract dispute to the<br/>District representative and have such grievances adjusted without the intervention of<br/>the Association as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this<br/>Agreement. The District shall not agree to the adjustment or resolution of the<br/>grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most grievances can be settled promptly and satisfactorily on an informal<br/>administrative level. The employer and the Association agree that every effort will be<br/>made by management and the grievant to settle grievances at the lowest possible<br/>level. The filing of a grievance shall not be construed as reflecting unfavorably upon<br/>a bargaining unit member’s good standing, performance, or loyalty or desirability to<br/>the organization. Bargaining unit members, their representatives and all other persons<br/>involved in the presentation of a grievance will be free from restraint, interference,<br/>coercion, discrimination, or reprisal.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the administration to adhere to decision deadlines constitutes the right for<br/>the grievant to appeal automatically to the next step (higher level). Failure of the<br/>bargaining unit member/Association to adhere to the submission deadlines shall mean<br/>that the bargaining unit member is satisfied with the latest decision and waives any<br/>right to further appeal under this process or procedure. However, nothing prevents the<br/>parties from extending the dates by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of a grievance takes place, the grievant is required to conform<br/>to the original direction of his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately<br/>from the personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to schedule meetings for the processing of grievances at<br/>times which will not interfere with the regular work day of the participants. If any<br/>grievance meeting or hearing must be scheduled during the school day, a bargaining<br/>unit member required by either party to participate as a witness or grievant in such<br/>meeting or hearing shall be released from regular duties without loss of pay for a<br/>reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grievance has been filed by a bargaining unit member or the Association, the<br/>grievant may terminate the grievance at any time by giving notice to the public school<br/>employer or its designee. Failure to comply with time limits to attend scheduled<br/>meetings to discuss or hear the grievance, or to provide requested information of the<br/>grievance shall be deemed a termination of the grievance by the bargaining unit<br/>member/Association. The public school employer may, but shall not be required, to<br/>give written notice of such termination to the bargaining unit member/Association.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant has the right to have a representative present at any step of the grievance<br/>procedure. The grievant, however, must be present at each step of the grievance<br/>procedure, except when unable to attend due to health, hardship or distance.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions:</p>

<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Resolution:</p>
<p>1. A bargaining unit member and/or the Association who believes they have a</p>
<p>grievance shall present the grievance orally to the immediate administrator within<br/>twenty (20) days after the grievant knew, or reasonably should have known, of the<br/>circumstances which form the basis for the grievance. Failure to do so will render<br/>the grievance null and void. The administrator shall hold discussions and attempt<br/>to resolve the matter within three (3) days after presentation of the grievance. It is</p>
<p>Adopted 5/29/14</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>the intent of this information meeting that at least one (1) personal conference will<br/>be held between the grievant and the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>M. Grievances will be processed in accordance with the following steps:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1 - If the grievance is not settled during the informal discussion, the grievant<br/>shall present the grievance in writing to the immediate administrator within four</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days after the oral decision by the administrator. The administrator shall<br/>respond in writing within four (4) days after receipt of the grievance. The written<br/>information shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the specific grounds of the grievance, including names, dates,<br/>and places necessary for a complete understanding of the grievance.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the reasons why the immediate administrator's proposed<br/>resolution of the problem is unacceptable.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of specific actions requested of the public school employer which<br/>will remedy the grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2 - If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievant shall, within five</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days after receipt of the written decision, present the grievance in writing to<br/>the next level administrator with immediate responsibility for the position to<br/>which the grievant is assigned.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3 - If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance, or if<br/>no disposition has been made within five (5) days of such meeting, the grievance<br/>shall be transmitted to the Superintendent or designee. Within five (5) days from<br/>the receipt of the grievance, the Superintendent or designee shall meet with the<br/>grievant on the grievance and shall indicate the disposition of the grievance in<br/>writing within five (5) days of such meeting and shall furnish a copy thereof to<br/>the Association and to the grievant.</p>
<p>Adopted 5/29/14</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>4. Step 4 -</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall within ten (10) additional days, or more by mutual<br/>agreement, determine whether to submit the grievance to arbitration. Only the<br/>Association (exclusive representative) may refer a grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive representative and the District shall agree upon an arbitrator. If<br/>no agreement can be reached, they shall request the State Conciliation Service<br/>to supply a panel of five (5) names of persons experienced in hearing<br/>grievances in public schools. Each party shall alternately strike a name until<br/>only one name remains. The order of striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision<br/>on the issue or issues submitted to him/her. If the parties cannot agree upon a<br/>submission agreement, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to<br/>the written grievance and the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to: (1) Add to, subtract from or modify the<br/>terms of this Agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations and<br/>procedures of the district; (2) Establish modify or alter the salary structure; (3)<br/>Take action for any claim for which there is another remedial procedure or<br/>course established by law or regulation; (4) Review, modify, or alter the<br/>evaluation of members of the unit except for alleged violations of procedural<br/>matters; (5) Act for any claim for tenure or wrongful termination; (6) Change<br/>Board policy or regulation; (7) Act on matters within the jurisdiction of state<br/>or federal agencies such as EEOC, DFEH, PERB and OSHA.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and both parties have had an opportunity to make written<br/>arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties his/her findings<br/>and recommendations which shall be binding to the parties.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne by the losing party. If<br/>the arbitrator issues a &quot;split&quot; decision, these expenses shall be borne equally<br/>by the District and the exclusive representative. The arbitrator will be apprised<br/>of this provision of the arbitration process and will be directed in his/ her<br/>findings to make an award of costs pursuant to this provision. All other<br/>expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>N. If the grievance arises from an action of authority higher than the principal of a<br/>school, the employee may present such grievances at Step 2 of this procedure.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided in this Agreement may be extended by mutual agreement when<br/>signed by the parties. Failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the<br/>decision on a grievance within the specified time limit shall permit the grievant to<br/>lodge an appeal at the next step of this procedure. Any grievance not advanced from</p>
<p>Adopted 5/29/14</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>one step to the next within the time limits of that step shall be deemed resolved by the<br/>public school employer's answer at the previous step.</p>

<p>ARTICLE V: PROFESSIONAL DUES OR FEES AND PAYROLL</p>
<p>DEDUCTION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher who is not a member of the Association may make application for<br/>membership.

Any teacher may<br/>authorize payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as is present county<br/>policy for members.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Share Fee</p>
<p>Any unit member who is not a member of the HUTA/CTA/NEA, and who does<br/>not make application for membership within thirty (30) days of the effective date<br/>of this Agreement, or within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of<br/>assigned duties within the bargaining unit, shall become a member of the<br/>Association or pay to the Association a fee in an amount equal to unified<br/>membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments, payable to the<br/>Association in one (1) lump-sum cash payment in the same manner as required<br/>for the payment of membership dues, provided, however, that the unit members<br/>may authorize payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as provided in<br/>Section 1 of this Article. In the event that a unit member shall not pay such fee<br/>directly to the Association, or authorize payment through payroll deduction as<br/>provided in Section 1 above, the Association shall so inform the District and the<br/>District shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in<br/>Education Code section 45061 and in the same manner as set forth in Section 1 of<br/>this Article. There shall be no charge to the Association for such mandatory<br/>agency fee deductions.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious Beliefs and Reasons of Conscience</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who desires to be exempt from joining the Association or<br/>paying the representative fee because of religious beliefs or reasons of conscience<br/>shall file a claim of exemption with the Association within thirty (30) days<br/>following ratification of this contract or following the commencement of the unit<br/>member’s working assignment.

<p>11</p>
<p>D. Hold Harmless</p>
<p>The Association agrees to pay to the District all reasonable legal fees and legal costs<br/>incurred in defending against any court action and/or administrative action<br/>challenging the legality or constitutionality of the fair share service fee provisions of<br/>this Agreement or their implementation. The Association shall have the exclusive<br/>right to decide and determine whether any such action or proceeding referred to<br/>above shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>E. Rescission and Reinstatement</p>

There shall not be more than one vote taken during<br/>the term of any collective bargaining agreement. (Gov. Code § 3546(d))</p>

That<br/>request shall be submitted to the Governing Board along with a petition containing<br/>the signatures of at least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit. The vote<br/>shall be conducted at the worksite by secret ballot, and shall be conducted no sooner<br/>than one year after the rescission of the fair share service fee provisions.</p>
<p>If the Governing Board determines that the appropriate number of signatures have<br/>been collected, it shall conduct the vote to rescind or reinstate in a manner that it shall<br/>prescribe in accordance with Government Code § 3546.</p>

A certificated employee employed for<br/>less than five (5) schools days per week shall be entitled, for a school year of<br/>service, to that proportion of ten (10) days leave of absence for illness or injury as<br/>the number of days he/she is employed per week bears to five (5) school days;<br/>pay for any day of such absence shall be the same as the pay which would have<br/>been received had the employee served during the day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When taken and accumulation - Credit for leave of absence need not be accrued<br/>prior to taking such leave by the employee and such leave of absence may be<br/>taken at any time during the school year.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit member responsibility to provide verification - The District<br/>reserves the right to demand proof of illness, for illnesses over five (5)<br/>consecutive days or three (3) in conjunction with holidays or weekends, or when<br/>the District, has evidence that a bargaining unit member took sick leave but was<br/>not in fact ill and used the leave for other purposes. And, District may withhold<br/>approval of any claim for sick leave benefits pending the receipt of a written<br/>statement from the medical doctor in attendance or other documentation that the<br/>District deems sufficient. Verification of the illness of the bargaining unit member<br/>by the doctor will be accepted as the required proof. Verification will be provided<br/>upon request.</p>
<p>a. Requirements for proof of absence shall not discriminate against evidence of<br/>treatment and the need thereof by the practice of any well recognized church<br/>or denomination.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of unused accumulated sick leave - All certificated personnel newly<br/>employed by the Hilmar Unified School District who have served in a certificated<br/>position in another school district in California for at least one year may transfer<br/>any unused accumulated sick leave from that district to the Hilmar Unified School<br/>District for up to two (2) years of the date of transfer. It is the employee's<br/>responsibility to initiate the request on forms provided by the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Notification - Bargaining unit members must contact their principal or<br/>principal's designee prior to the close of business on the preceding day in the case<br/>of illness to permit the District time to secure substitute services.

<p>Adopted 5/29/14</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>unaware of the degree of their illness, prior to the close of business on the<br/>preceding day. Failure to provide adequate notice under the circumstances may be<br/>grounds for denial of leave with pay.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave For Pregnancy Disability</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members are entitled to use accumulated sick leave as set forth in<br/>the sick leave policy and extended leave policy for disabilities caused or<br/>contributed by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery there from on the<br/>same terms and conditions governing leaves of absence from other illness or<br/>medical disability. The length of such disability, including date on which the<br/>leave shall commence and the date on which the duties are to be resumed, shall be<br/>determined by the bargaining unit member's physician.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit employee on leave for pregnancy disability shall be entitled to return to<br/>the same position to that held at the time the leave commenced.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Illness Leave</p>
<p>1. If a teacher has utilized all of his/her accumulated sick leave and is still absent<br/>from his/her duties on account of illness or accident for a period of five (5) school<br/>months or less, then the amo unt of salary deducted in any month shall not exceed<br/>the sum which was actually paid a substitute or fifty percent (50%) of the salary<br/>due him/her during the period of absence, whichever is the lesser amount. The<br/>five (5) months or less period during which the above deduction occurs shall not<br/>begin until all other paid sick leave provisions for which he/she is eligible have<br/>been exhausted.</p>
<p>D. Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entitlement and payment - Every person employed by a school district in a<br/>position requiring certification qualifications is entitled to a leave of absence, not<br/>to exceed three (3) days, or five (5) days if out-of-state travel or one-way trips<br/>over 225 miles is required, on account of the death of any member of his/</p>

In the event that<br/>sufficient funds are not available the allocation and authorized number of mentors<br/>for each participating school district would be decreased on a pro-rate basis.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>D. Selection Committee</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentor teacher candidates are selected by a nominating committee comprised of a<br/>majority of certificated classroom teachers. These teachers are selected by the<br/>teachers at their school site. Schools with less than 400 ADA* will elect one<br/>teacher to serve on the selection committee. Schools with more than 400 ADA<br/>will elect two teachers to serve on the selection committee. Each school will be<br/>represented by one administrator. (* ADA shall be based on the figures as shown<br/>on the P2 State report)</p>
<p>The superintendent will appoint one administrator to serve as District Mentor<br/>Coordinator, and as such, this person will facilitate the recruitment, selection,<br/>implementation, and completion of fiscal reports with regard to the mentor<br/>program. The governing board may appoint parents, students, or other<br/>representatives to advise the committee or the board in the selection process.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a committee member chooses to apply for mentor teachers, the committee<br/>member will be replaced by a new committee member chosen by the classroom<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>E. Selection Process</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrator from each school will assist the teacher(s) that were elected to<br/>serve on the selection committee to develop job description(s) for their site<br/>mentor(s) based upon their site level needs. Input from all certificated staff will be<br/>solicited. These job descriptions will include specific activities that teachers<br/>perceive to be valuable for professional growth.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Mentor Coordinator will post a vacancy announcement, invite<br/>applications, and facilitate the selection process.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentors will be nominated by the selection committee to serve as &quot;site-level<br/>mentors&quot; with a primary focus on meeting site-level needs and a secondary focus<br/>on meeting district-level needs. It is the intention of the mentor selection<br/>committee to evenly distribute the mentor nominations throughout the district<br/>based on teacher population.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection committee will review the needs as expressed by each site prior to<br/>the selection interviews. Candidates who best demonstrate the ability to meet the<br/>site- level needs will be nominated for board appointment as mentors by majority.<br/>The committee may observe candidates in a classroom setting.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection committee may nominate for mentor teacher any applicant who<br/>meets the qualifications, provided the committee determines upon review of all of<br/>the information presented that the teacher has demonstrated exemplary teaching</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>ability including, but not limited to, effective communication skills, subject matter<br/>knowledge, and mastery of a range of teaching strategies.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment</p>
<p>1. Prospective mentors nominated by the selection committee will present their<br/>qualifications to meet described site-level needs to the board of trustees during a<br/>regularly scheduled meeting. Prior to designation of any nominee as a mentor<br/>teacher, the governing board may gather such further information as it deems<br/>necessary to evaluate the nominee. The governing board may reject any<br/>nomination giving written reasons to the candidate and committee for the<br/>rejections of any recommendation.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duration of Assignment</p>
<p>1. The duration of a designation as mentor teacher will be for a period of at least one<br/>year, from date of board appointment to June 30th of the following year, as<br/>directed by the superintendent. Mentor teachers may reapply for consecutive<br/>yearly assignments not to exceed three years. Upon completing three years as a<br/>mentor teacher, an individual may be renominated if the committee deems it<br/>appropriate following a review of the teacher's performance.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentors at each site will provide services in four areas: (1) assistance and<br/>guidance to new and experienced teachers, (2) staff development, (3) curriculum<br/>development, and (4) other services, i.e., teaching exemplary class lessons.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mentor teacher will not participate in the evaluation of other teachers. It will<br/>become the duty and responsibility of the mentor to carry out the prescribed<br/>activities within the budget provided.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentors will record activities by hours as prescribed by the selection committee<br/>in four sets of 42.5 hours each. Log sheets will be signed by the site supervisor<br/>and the district mentor coordinator prior to disbursement of funds. All hours must</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>be completed, recorded, approved, and filed prior to June 30th of each fiscal year,<br/>with exceptions granted only by the district superintendent of schools and board<br/>of trustees. Signature of the time log assures the district that hours have been<br/>completed in good faith.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mentor shall receive a stipend annually, consistent with and pursuant to<br/>Education Code, Sections 44490 through 44497. The stipend shall not qualify for<br/>application of STRS contributions or benefits.</p>

Mentors will collaborate with<br/>their site principal and cadre of teachers to develop a budget for support materials<br/>and services. They will submit this budget to the district mentor coordinator for<br/>approval. Mentors will be held responsible for working within the budget set<br/>forth.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment purchased with mentor funds will support prescribed mentor activities<br/>and will revert to district office inventory at the conclusion of the mentor project<br/>for reallocation the following year by the district superintendent.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All encumbrances will be signed by the site principal and the district mentor<br/>coordinator. All encumbrances will be filed prior to March 15th of each fiscal<br/>year, with exceptions granted only by the district mentor coordinator or<br/>superintendent. Exceptions will be made only for substitute and travel/conference<br/>expenses when arranged prior to March 15th.

Proration is<br/>allowed only under very limited, non-programmatic circumstances.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>K. Evaluation</p>
<p>1. The mentor selection committee will evaluate the success of each mentor upon<br/>completion with a focus on the mentor's positive impact upon the teachers and<br/>students of the district, the appropriateness of activities, maintenance of budget,<br/>and positive contribution to the schools. Written memorandums may be provided<br/>to each mentor’s site principal for inclusion in the teacher's summarative<br/>evaluation.</p>
