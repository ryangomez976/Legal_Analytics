<p>15.11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will be given the option to pay his/her share of premium<br/>payments on the same schedule as payments are made under COBRA.</p>

<p>15.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not exceed ninety (90) days, except in cases of assault or<br/>battery injury, where such leave shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) days during<br/>which the schools of the County Office are required to be in session, or when the unit<br/>member would otherwise have been performing work for the Superintendent in any one<br/>fiscal year for the same industrial accident.</p>
<p>15.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When and if there is any challenge to an unit member’s physician statement<br/>resulting from an industrial leave the Superintendent may require an independent<br/>examination if the circumstances justify a verification. Second and third opinions shall be<br/>handled according to JPA policy. The Superintendent shall pay the costs of the independent<br/>physician’s examination, including mileage, lodging and food if the examination requires a<br/>stay over, and without loss of pay.</p>

<p>15.12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member fails to endorse to the Superintendent any wage loss<br/>disability indemnity check received on account of the industrial accident or illness as<br/>provided above, the Superintendent shall deduct from the unit member's salary warrant<br/>the amount of such disability indemnity actually paid to and retained by the unit member.</p>

<p>15.16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a catastrophic illness or injury incapacitates an employee or a member of<br/>his/her family for an extended period of time and the employee has exhausted all paid<br/>leaves of absence, other employees may donate accrued vacation and/or sick leave credits<br/>to that employee under the specific requirements of the Superintendent's catastrophic leave<br/>program (SP 4161.9).</p>
<p>15.16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations made under the catastrophic leave program shall be strictly voluntary<br/>and confidential.</p>
