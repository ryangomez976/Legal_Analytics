<p>ARTICLE 1 - AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Articles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding</p>
<p>agreement by and between the Igo-Ono-Platina Union School District (hereinafter<br/>referred to as &quot;District&quot;) and the Igo-Ono-Platina Teachers Association CTA/NEA<br/>(hereinafter referred to as “Association”).</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540-3549 of the</p>
<p>Government Code. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1</p>
<p>2.1 The District confirms its recognition of the Association as the exclusive representative for<br/>those certificated employees in the representation unit recognized by the District per its<br/>resolution at the meeting of the Governing Board of June 12, 1980. The unit excludes<br/>substitutes, management, supervisory, and confidential employees.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievance which may arise between an employee and the District with respect to the<br/>interpretation or application of any of the terms of this Agreement, except as otherwise<br/>provided in this Agreement, shall be determined by the provisions of this Article. Grievant as<br/>used in this Agreement is defined as an employee of the District.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance Procedure</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<p>Step One:</p></td><td>
<p>The initial step in the adjustment of a grievance shall be a discussion between<br/>the Grievant or his representative and the Principal who will answer within ten<br/>(10) calendar days. This step shall be started within thirty (30) calendar days<br/>of the date of the action complained of, or the date the grievant became aware<br/>of the incident which is the basis for the grievance.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>Step Two:</p></td><td>
<p>If a grievance is not resolved in the first step, the second step shall be<br/>presentation of the grievance, in writing, to the Principal, who shall answer, in<br/>writing, within twenty (20) calendar days. The second step shall be taken<br/>within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the answer in Step One. The<br/>written presentation shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the<br/>circumstances involved, the pertinent dates, the decision rendered at the<br/>previous step, the section of the Agreement alleged to be violated, and the<br/>specific remedy sought.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>Step Three:</p></td><td>
<p>If a grievance is not resolved in the second step, the third step shall be the<br/>presentation of the grievance, in writing, to the Superintendent or designee,<br/>who shall answer, in writing, within twenty (20) calendar days. The third step<br/>shall be taken within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the answer in Step<br/>Two. The written presentation shall be a clear, concise statement of the<br/>grievance, the circumstances involved, the pertinent dates, the decision<br/>rendered at the previous step, the section of the Agreement alleged to be<br/>violated, and the specific remedy sought.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>Step Four:</p></td><td>
<p>If a grievance is not resolved in the third step, the fourth step shall be referral<br/>by the Association to mediation within twenty (20) calendar days of the<br/>answer in Step Three. Whenever a grievance is referred to mediation, either<br/>party shall request that the California State Mediation and Conciliation<br/>Service refer a State Mediator. The State Mediator shall assist the parties in<br/>the resolution of the grievance in the same manner as that which is normally<br/>used in the mediation of interest disputes. Referral to Step Five shall not<br/>occur until the Mediator has released the parties from the mediation process.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>Step Five:</p></td><td>
<p>If a grievance is not resolved in the fourth step, the fifth step shall be referral<br/>by the Association to arbitration within twenty (20) calendar days of the</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>3</p>
<p>An Arbitrator shall be appointed on each occasion that a grievance is<br/>submitted to arbitration. In the event that the District and the Association are<br/>unable to agree on the selection of an Arbitrator, they shall request the State<br/>of California Mediation and Conciliation Service to nominate five (5) persons<br/>to be the Arbitrator. The District and the Association each will alternately<br/>challenge two (2) of such nominees, the party having the first challenge to be<br/>determined by lot. The remaining nominee shall be accepted as the Arbitrator<br/>and his compensation and expenses shall be borne equally by the District and<br/>the Association. The District and the Association shall pay the compensation<br/>and expenses of their respective appointees and witnesses. At Association<br/>request District shall release Grievant from duty to participate in arbitration<br/>proceedings. Expense items such as court reporters, transcripts, or room rent,<br/>when requested by either the Arbitrator or by both parties, shall be borne<br/>equally by the parties. Whenever such items are requested by only one of the<br/>parties, the expense shall be borne by that party.</p>
<p>Am Arbitrator shall hold such hearings and shall consider such evidence as to<br/>the Arbitrator appears necessary and proper. The decision of the Arbitrator<br/>shall be final and binding on the District, the Association and the Grievant, and<br/>shall not in any way add to, disregard or modify any of the provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>Failure by the Grievant to meet any of the aforementioned time limits will<br/>result in forfeiture of the grievance. Except, however, that the<br/>aforementioned time limits may be extended by written mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Any employee may present grievances in accordance with this Article without<br/>the intervention of the Association, so long as the adjustment is reached prior<br/>to Arbitration and is not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this<br/>Agreement and further provided that the District shall not agree to a<br/>resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the<br/>grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to<br/>file a response.</p>
<p>A Grievant shall in no way interfere with the right of the District to proceed in<br/>carrying out its management responsibilities subject to a final decision on the<br/>grievance. In the event the grievance involved an order, requirement or other<br/>directive, the Grievant shall fulfill or carry out such order, requirements or<br/>directives, pending the final decision of the grievance.</p>
<p>All documents resulting from the processing of a grievance shall be kept in a<br/>separate grievance file and shall not be placed in an employee's personnel file.</p>

<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules for General Absences:</p>
<p>Unit members shall not be absent during a work day except on an approved leave of absence,<br/>as defined herein.</p>
<p>If an employee needs to be absent from duty, notice must be given to the District Office.<br/>Except in the event of an emergency, the District Office shall be notified prior to the day of<br/>absence. It is the responsibility of the employee to see that the class roll book, lesson plans,<br/>and other pertinent material necessary to conduct the class are made available to the school.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave:</p>
<p>Unit members employed five (5) days per week shall be entitled to ten (10) work days leave<br/>of absence for illness or injury with full pay, for each school year of service. Unit members<br/>employed less than five (5) days per week shall be entitled to a proportionate amount of sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>9.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may accumulate unused sick leave without limitation.</p>
<p>9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a doctor's verification following any absence due to illness or<br/>injury as a condition of payment of sick leave. Except in the event of a concerted<br/>activity, the District shall pay the cost of the examination. In the event that such<br/>doctor's verification does not provide the District with sufficient information, the<br/>employee shall obtain another statement from his/her physician that verifies that sick<br/>leave was for the reasons stated.</p>
<p>9.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees returning to work from Sick Leave from surgery or a serious illness, upon<br/>the request of the District, must provide a doctor's release certifying medical<br/>permission to return to work.</p>
<p>9.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member's employment terminates and more sick leave has been used than<br/>earned, the amount used but not earned shall be deducted from the final pay warrant.</p>
<p>9.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee is absent from duties on account of illness or accident for a period<br/>of five (5) school months or less, the amount deducted from the salary due the<br/>employee for any month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum actually<br/>paid any substitute employee employed to fill the position during the absence; or if no<br/>substitute employee was employed, the amount which would have been paid to the<br/>substitute had he/she been employed.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Leave:</p>
<p>Unit members are entitled to use sick leave as set forth in Section 9.2 for disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom, on the same<br/>terms and conditions governing leaves of absence for other illness or medical disability. Such</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>leave shall not be used for child care, child rearing, or preparation for childbearing, but shall<br/>be limited to those disabilities as set forth above. The length of such disability leave, including<br/>the date on which the leave shall commence and the date on which the duties are to be<br/>resumed, shall be determined by the unit member and the unit member’s physician, provided<br/>that such verification clearly demonstrates to the District that such leave is solely for<br/>pregnancy-related disability purposes. In the event that such doctor's verification does not so<br/>demonstrate to the District, the employee shall obtain another statement from her physician<br/>which verifies that such leave is solely for pregnancy-related disability purposes.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Care Leave:</p>
<p>Unit members may be granted parental child care leave of up to one (1) year for the purpose<br/>of preparing for and caring of a newly bom or newly adopted child.</p>

<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for such leave must be made at least thirty (30) work days (except in the<br/>event of an unforeseen circumstance) prior to the requested beginning date in the case<br/>of a newly bom child and as far in advance as possible in the case of an adoption. In<br/>the event of such unforeseen circumstance, the leave request shall be submitted as<br/>soon as possible prior to the leave. The beginning date and duration of such leave<br/>shall be at the discretion of the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident and Illness Leave:</p>
<p>Unit members shall be eligible for leave of absence because of industrial accident or illness<br/>which the District's industrial accident insurance carrier considers a valid claim. Allowable<br/>leaves shall be for not more than sixty (60) service days in any one (1) fiscal year for the same<br/>accident and shall commence with the first (1st) day of absence.</p>
<p>9.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence under this provision shall not be accumulated from year to year.<br/>When the Industrial Accident or Illness Leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the<br/>employee shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due him/her for the<br/>same illness or injury.</p>
<p>9.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall be paid such portion of the salary due them for any month in which<br/>absence occurs, as when added to the temporary disability indemnity under the<br/>California Labor Code, will result in payment to them of not more than their full<br/>salaries.</p>
<p>9.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence applied for under this provision shall be reduced by one (1) day for<br/>each day of authorized absence, regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award<br/>to the employee.</p>
<p>9.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Illness and Accident Leave is to be used in lieu of Sick Leave. When</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>entitlement to Industrial Illness and Accident Leave has been exhausted, entitlement to<br/>Sick Leave shall then be used. If an employee is receiving a temporary disability<br/>indemnity, the employee shall be entitled to utilize only so much of his or her sick<br/>leave and vacation leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity,<br/>will result in a payment to him/her of no more than a full day's wage or salary. The<br/>Employer in turn shall issue the appropriate salary warrants for payment of salary and<br/>shall deduct normal retirement and other authorized deductions.</p>
<p>9.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless travel outside of California is authorized by the District, employees receiving<br/>benefits under the policy during a period of illness or injury shall remain in the State of<br/>California.</p>
