<p>8</p><h6>ARTICLE VI</h6><h6>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</h6>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a formal written statement by a unit member or members or the<br/>Association alleging that the District has violated a specific provision of this<br/>Agreement. All other materials and disputes of any nature are beyond the scope<br/>of these procedures. Actions to change the general policies of the District as set<br/>forth in the rules and regulations of the administration and Board must be taken<br/>under separate process.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is the Association or employee or employees of the District covered<br/>by the terms of this Agreement. The District may consider grievances of a like<br/>nature from more than one grievant as one grievance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “party in interest” is any person, the Association, and/or the District who might<br/>be required to take action or against whom action might be taken in order to<br/>resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “respondent” in all cases shall be the District itself rather than any individual.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is any day on which the District administrative office is open for business.<br/>The month of July and the first twenty calendar days of August are excepted from<br/>time computations in the grievance procedure. If year-round schools are<br/>implemented, this paragraph shall be deemed a mandatory reopened subject for<br/>negotiations that year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate supervisor” is the lowest level supervisor having immediate<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant and who has been designated to administer<br/>grievances.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “conferee” is a person who, at the request of the employee or administrator/<br/>supervisor, is invited to participate in a problem resolution conference or meeting<br/>to consider a grievance. A conferee cannot be an administrator who may<br/>subsequently hear the grievance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the grievance procedures is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable resolution to the problems which may from time to<br/>time arise affecting the welfare or working conditions of unit members. Both parties<br/>agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be<br/>appropriate at any level of the procedure. The District and Association shall work<br/>together in the investigation and resolution of any formally filed grievance.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>C. PROCEDURE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level: Before filing a formal written grievance, a grievant should attempt<br/>to resolve the problem by an informal conference with the immediate supervisor.<br/>Employees are encouraged to approach their immediate supervisor as quickly as<br/>possible to initiate the process in order to permit compliance with the filing<br/>deadline in C.2., below.</p>
<p>a. If a written reason for denying the grievance is requested by the grievant<br/>and provided at the informal level by the administration or immediate<br/>supervisor, the formal written grievance shall be filed at Level Two but<br/>within the time limits stated at Level One. If the reasons are not presented<br/>in writing by the administration or immediate supervisor, the grievant must<br/>file the formal written grievance at Level One.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: To utilize the grievance procedure provided in this agreement, the<br/>grievant must file the formal grievance in writing with the immediate supervisor<br/>on the District grievance form within twenty days after the grievant knew or<br/>reasonably should have known of the grievable event which formed the basis of<br/>the grievance. The immediate supervisor shall meet with the grievant and/or<br/>designated Association representative within five days of receipt of the<br/>grievance. The immediate supervisor shall provide a written disposition of the<br/>grievance, including the reasons therefore, to all parties of interest within ten<br/>days of such meeting. Beginning at Level One, the Association has the right to<br/>be present at all grievance meetings.</p>
<p>a. If the grievant and/or the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of<br/>the grievance or if no disposition has occurred within five days of such<br/>meeting or ten days from the date of the presentation of the grievance, the<br/>grievance may be appealed to Level Two, with a copy of all grievance<br/>forms and responses provided to the Association President by the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: The Superintendent or his/her designee shall meet with the grievant<br/>and/or designated Association representative within five days of receipt of the<br/>grievance appeal and shall provide a written disposition of the grievance,<br/>including the reasons therefore, to all parties of interest within five days of such<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>a. If the grievant and/or the Association are not satisfied with the disposition<br/>of the grievance or if no disposition has occurred within five days of such<br/>meeting or ten days from the date of the receipt of the grievance at Level<br/>Two, the grievant may request that the Association submit the grievance<br/>to Level Three.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>3. Level Three:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at<br/>Level Two, or if no decision has been rendered within ten days after<br/>he/she first met with the Superintendent or his/her designee, he/she may<br/>within ten days after he/she first met with the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee, whichever is sooner, request in writing that the Association<br/>submit his/her grievance to arbitration. A copy of the request to the<br/>Association shall be delivered to the Superintendent at the time the<br/>Association files for arbitration. If the Association determines that the<br/>grievance merits further hearings, it may, by written notice to the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, within fifteen days after the receipt of<br/>the request from the grievant, submit the grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall attempt to select a mutually acceptable impartial<br/>arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within ten<br/>days, a request for a list of arbitrators shall be made to the American<br/>Arbitration Association by either party, with a copy of the request sent to<br/>the other party, and the parties will then be bound by American Arbitration<br/>Association rules in the selection of an arbitrator and the conduct of the<br/>arbitration hearing.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall attempt to mutually agree upon the issue or issues for<br/>the selected arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree upon the submission<br/>statement, each party may submit its own arbitrator’s submission<br/>statement, and the arbitrator shall then determine the issue or issues by<br/>referring to the grievance and the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator so selected will confer with the representatives of the<br/>District and the Association and will schedule hearings to be held<br/>promptly. The arbitrator’s award will be in writing and will set forth his/her<br/>findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issue or issues<br/>submitted. The arbitrator will be without power or authority to add to,<br/>subtract from, or modify the express terms of this Agreement. The award<br/>of the arbitrator shall be binding on all parties to this Agreement.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs for the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if<br/>any, and his/her travel and subsistence expenses, and the costs of any<br/>hearing room will be borne equally by the District and the Association. All<br/>other costs will be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sole and Exclusive Method: In consideration of the foregoing<br/>arrangement for adjustment of grievance, the parties agree that the<br/>grievance procedure provided herein is the sole and exclusive method of<br/>seeking adjustment or redress of grievance.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>4. TIME LIMITS</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day following receipt<br/>of the grievance, grievance appeal, or written decision. The time<br/>limits specified at each level should be made to expedite the grievance<br/>process. The time limits may, however, be modified by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year and, if left unsolved may result in harm to the grievant, the time limits<br/>set forth herein shall be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted<br/>prior to the end of the school year or as soon as practicable. If the time<br/>limits are affected by vacation periods, they may be modified by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievant fails to carry his/her grievance forward to the next level within<br/>the prescribed time period, the grievance shall be considered settled upon<br/>the decision rendered at the most recent level utilized.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a supervisor or manager fails to respond within the given time period,<br/>the grievant may appeal his/her grievance to the next higher level.</p>
<p>5. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Representation: A grievant may be represented at all stages of the<br/>grievance by a designated Association representative or may represent<br/>him/herself. The Association and District have the right to obtain and/or utilize<br/>assistance from outside the Association and District at any level of this grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release Time: The grievant and/or his/her representative shall be entitled to<br/>reasonable release time to process a grievance during normal working hours and<br/>meeting with District representatives. Upon mutual consent of the grievant and<br/>the District, release time shall be provided. Any unit member who is requested to<br/>appear in such investigations, meetings, or hearings as a witness will also be<br/>entitled to reasonable release time.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings: The grievant must be present at all meetings related to the grievance<br/>unless he/she chooses to have his/her representative at the meeting and not<br/>attend himself/herself. Meeting times and places and other conditions relative to<br/>the resolution of formal grievances shall be set, in advance, by mutual agreement<br/>of the grievant and the District so as to cause the least disruption to normal<br/>operations of the District and/or the employee’s work schedule.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at a level above the principal or immediate supervisor, the grievant<br/>may submit such grievance in writing directly to the Superintendent and the<br/>Association with the processing of such grievance to commence at Level Two.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>The Association, either in its own behalf or in behalf of the affected teacher, may<br/>initiate a grievance which affects more than one teacher at a single site or<br/>teachers at more than one site at Level Two.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the processing of a grievance, all documents, communications, and<br/>records dealing with that grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and<br/>will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the participants, unless there is an<br/>independent basis for their inclusion in the personnel file.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, making appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents shall be developed together<br/>by the Association and the District and given appropriate distribution so as to<br/>facilitate operation of the grievance procedure. The costs of developing and<br/>duplicating such forms shall be borne by the District.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon mutual agreement of the Association and the Superintendent, or his or her<br/>designee, a grievance may be taken directly to a higher level.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may at any time present grievances to the employer and have<br/>such grievances adjusted without the intervention of the Association as long as<br/>the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and such adjustment is not<br/>inconsistent with terms of this Agreement. If an employee presents a formal<br/>grievance on his/her own behalf, the Association shall have the right to be<br/>present and state its views at all grievance meetings. The District shall not agree<br/>to a resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the<br/>grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file<br/>a response. The Association shall have ten calendar days to file a response<br/>before the resolution shall be considered in effect.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the District against any grievant, any<br/>party of interest, any member of the Association, or any other participant in the<br/>grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>13</p><h6>ARTICLE VII</h6><h6>ASSIGNMENT, TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENT</h6>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s responsibility is to assign teaching personnel in a manner to best<br/>accomplish the instructional objectives of the District. The District will carefully<br/>consider the assignment of all teaching personnel from the point of view that<br/>reasonable efforts will be made to meet the needs and desires of the teacher<br/>whenever possible. Of equal importance is the responsibility to build a professional<br/>team of educators at each school site that will produce the highest quality of<br/>educational program for children and support the total District educational program.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it relates to transfer/reassignment, it is the responsibility of the teacher to plan<br/>his/her professional growth and credential authorizations to meet the<br/>qualifications of the desired positions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will send to each employee, including those on leave of absence, a<br/>Request for Transfer/Reassignment form prior to March 15 of each year.<br/>Employees who desire a transfer or reassignment shall deliver their completed<br/>request to the District Personnel Services Coordinator by March 31 to be assured<br/>of consideration for the following school year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “transfer” is the movement of a unit member from one work location to another<br/>at a different work/school site.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “reassignment” is the movement of a unit member from one subject area to<br/>another subject area or one grade level to another grade level at the same work/<br/>school site.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “vacancy” is an unfilled position which the District intends to fill. A “vacancy”<br/>exists for purposes of Article VII.C, if a non-temporary employee resigns,<br/>transfers, is dismissed or nonreelected, or goes on leave of absence anticipated<br/>to exceed 91 working days, as is referenced in Article XIII.A.4 and 5, and the<br/>District intends to fill that position.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Longevity”, for the purposes of these provisions on transfer/reassignment, is<br/>defined as the unit member’s position on the District seniority list for certificated<br/>employees.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seniority list ranks unit members according to each member’s first<br/>date of paid service as a probationary employee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lottery will determine placement for unit members with identical seniority</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>dates.</p>
<p>c. When necessary, a lottery to determine seniority ranking will be conducted<br/>by the District with at least one Association representative present.</p>
<p>C. VACANCIES</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a vacancy occurring, the site administrator shall review written requests for<br/>transfer to such a vacancy, written requests for reassignment, and other<br/>possibilities for reassignment at that school and may choose a qualified applicant<br/>from among those persons. Employees returning from a leave of absence would<br/>only constitute “other possibilities for reassignment at that school” if they worked<br/>at that same school site immediately prior to commencing their leave. The site<br/>administrator shall inform those making the requests for transfer of the final<br/>decision as soon as possible. The “site administrator” at a self-governed school<br/>would be the District administrator assigned to the school, who will seek and<br/>consider input from the school facilitator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching vacancies not filled as described in C.1., above, will be posted as soon<br/>as reasonably practicable. Request for Transfer/Reassignment forms on file with<br/>the district office will be used in consideration of candidates for vacancies<br/>occurring over the summer recess. Notice of vacancies will be mailed only to<br/>those staff having expressed interest on the form. Although employees may<br/>amend the form at any time, the amended form must be delivered to the<br/>Personnel Services Coordinator no later than the final filing date to be considered<br/>for a specific vacancy.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A posted teaching vacancy will include the closing date which is at least five<br/>working days following the posting date, a job description, and qualifications<br/>necessary to meet the requirements of the position. The District Superintendent<br/>will seek and consider input from the site administrator (or school facilitator, in<br/>the case of a self-governed school) but has the ultimate authority to determine<br/>the job description and qualifications to be set forth in the posting.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as allowed under C.1., above, no assignment to fill a vacancy shall be<br/>made until after the publicized closing date.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has already communicated in writing a desire for a transfer/<br/>reassignment during the course of one school year, it will not be necessary for<br/>that unit member to make further communication in order to be considered for<br/>any vacancies for which that unit member has applied.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the District has a vacancy, bargaining unit members who are<br/>temporary teachers may apply for the position. If a temporary teacher is ranked<br/>by the interview team as the top applicant in a multi-applicant pool, the District<br/>will reclassify the temporary teacher as probationary, provided that the temporary</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>teacher has been employed by the District for at least 75% of two school years,<br/>and has been positively evaluated during the course of those two years. An<br/>employee who is so reclassified may elect to remain in his/her current<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long-term substitute who serves in one position for more than ninety (90)<br/>consecutive work days shall be reclassified as a temporary employee as of the<br/>ninety-first (91st) day.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No outside applicant shall be selected to fill a vacancy or newly created position<br/>if there is a qualified unit member applicant as determined by the District.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a permanent employee applies for a temporary position for which the unit<br/>member is qualified, then he/she will be considered as any other unit member<br/>(see C.1. through C.6., above). If selected for the temporary position, the unit<br/>member will retain the original permanent status once the temporary position has<br/>terminated.</p>
<p>D. VOLUNTARY TRANSFER/REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may submit a written request for reassignment or transfer to the<br/>District when a vacancy is posted or at any time whether or not a vacancy exists.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two or more unit members with the appropriate credentials apply for a vacancy,<br/>the unit member whom the District determines is better or more qualified<br/>according to the qualifications delineated on the posted position shall be<br/>selected.</p>
<p>a. In the event that two or more unit members are equally qualified as<br/>determined by the District, the unit member with the greater longevity will<br/>be selected for the position.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member’s request for voluntary transfer or reassignment is denied, upon<br/>request of the unit member, a meeting with the administrator who denied the<br/>request will be held to discuss the reasons for the denial. Upon request by the<br/>unit member, the administrator will provide written reasons.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member requests that his/her application for transfer be kept confidential,<br/>the written request from the unit member must be submitted directly to the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee and must clearly state the desire for<br/>confidentiality.</p>
<p>a. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall make every effort to<br/>maintain such confidentiality until the final decision-making stages of<br/>staffing patterns and assignments have been made.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>b. The unit member may contact the Superintendent or his/her designee to<br/>inquire about the status of the confidential request.</p>
<p>5. A unit member who returns to the District from a leave of absence shall be<br/>responsible to contact the Superintendent, or his/her designee, by April 1 for any<br/>leave ending at the end of the school year and at least 20 work days prior to the<br/>scheduled return from any other leave to discuss preferences for a teaching and<br/>school assignment.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member fails to contact the Superintendent or his/her designee<br/>by the specified dates, assignments will be determined by the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member so desires, the District will make every attempt to place<br/>the returning teacher in the same position or other requested position, if<br/>the Administration determines that the placement is appropriate.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers returning from leave will be assigned to a position and school<br/>before persons are employed from outside the District for any position for<br/>which the returning teacher is qualified.</p>
<p>E. INVOLUNTARY TRANSFER/REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be transferred or reassigned to school sites and/or positions<br/>for which he/she is credentialed and/or qualified.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to have the unit member who is under consideration for<br/>involuntary transfer or reassignment voluntarily agrees to a transfer or<br/>reassignment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers/reassignments shall be made by the District according to<br/>the following guidelines which are not listed in any priority order:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to better utilize a curricular or instructional strength of the unit member;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to better utilize experience/background and/or other leadership<br/>capabilities of the unit member;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to place a unit member in a position that better serves the needs of the<br/>students in the school or assignment to which the transfer or<br/>reassignment is made;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enable the District to place a teacher returning from leave in an<br/>assignment for which that teacher is appropriately credentialed and<br/>qualified.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon an involuntary transfer/reassignment, and upon request, a meeting with the<br/>designated District representative to discuss the reasons shall be conducted.</p>
<p>a. Upon request by the unit member, the District representative will provide a</p>
<p>written summary of the meeting.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer/reassignment of a unit member will not be made for punitive<br/>reasons.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning from leave shall be afforded all the rights and procedures<br/>provided under this Section E.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may appeal any transfer/reassignment to the District Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee and then to the Board of Trustees, whose decision is final. The<br/>appeal shall be filed in writing within five regular teacher workdays after receiving<br/>notice of the transfer/ reassignment, and shall contain a description of the<br/>transfer/reassignment and the reasons the teacher objects to the action.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are transferred, reassigned, or assigned during the school<br/>year will, upon request, meet with the administrator who is in direct supervision of<br/>the school or assignment to discuss release time for preparation.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of (2) two days of release time for preparation will be afforded<br/>the unit member in case of transfer.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall assist in the moving of the unit member’s materials in the<br/>case of transfer or in reassignment to another classroom.</p>
<p>F. NOTIFICATION OF ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to notify unit members of probable assignment and<br/>school site for the following year no later than June 1.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that there is a change in assignment/school site, the unit member<br/>will be notified as soon as reasonable after the decision is reached. The<br/>District shall provide the unit member with the reasons and circumstances<br/>leading to the decision. Upon the request of the unit member, the reasons<br/>will be given in writing.</p>
<p>18</p><h6>ARTICLE VIII<br/>EVALUATION</h6>
<p>A. GENERAL EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>The primary purposes of evaluation are to improve the performance of teachers and<br/>increase the learning of pupils. The evaluation program will address temporary,<br/>probationary and permanent teachers for these purposes. Concerted efforts for<br/>evaluation will be provided to probationary teachers to encourage their success in<br/>providing quality educational services to pupils.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All probationary personnel will be formally evaluated at least once each school<br/>year. Permanent unit members shall ordinarily be evaluated every other year but<br/>may be evaluated more often if desired by the supervisor. If requested by the<br/>unit member, every reasonable effort will be made by the supervisor to evaluate<br/>the unit member more frequently. The term “evaluator” as used herein may be<br/>the immediate supervisor and/or his/her designee. The Superintendent, Director<br/>of Educational Services, or designated administrator will provide for the<br/>evaluation of certificated staff assigned to a site or program without a principal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Education Code Section 44664, unit members with<br/>permanent status who have been employed at least ten (10) years with the<br/>school district, are highly qualified as defined in 20 U.S.C. Section 7801 (ESEA)<br/>and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding<br/>standards (whose previous annual evaluation included no unsatisfactory ratings<br/>in any standard), shall be evaluated every five (5) years if the unit member and<br/>evaluator agree. Teachers in non-core areas may also participate in this process<br/>if they are determined by the District to be highly qualified using the Certificate of<br/>Compliance developed by the California Department of Education. The unit<br/>member or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time. Should the unit<br/>member or the evaluator withdraw consent, notice shall be given to the other<br/>party no later than September 30.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of unit members shall be based on the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession adopted by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing in<br/>January 1997, approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in the<br/>same month, and endorsed by the State Board of Education in July 1997.<br/>Evaluation shall also be based on performance of site and district responsibilities<br/>and non-instructional duties.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously negotiated Option B will be available at all sites to teachers with<br/>permanent status who have received a satisfactory review by an administrator<br/>through Option A.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations shall be based on classroom observations, evaluation conferences,<br/>other direct evaluator observations, and other substantiated, relevant and<br/>material information as described in Articles XI and XIV.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process of evaluation, the evaluator shall consider the lack of adequate<br/>materials provided the unit member as a factor that may hinder the member’s<br/>performance or the achievement of his/her objectives. The evaluator shall not<br/>consider any of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal life or opinions of a unit member unless it prevents him/her<br/>from performing his/her duties.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsubstantiated comments of a classroom aide or student teacher.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor performance by a student teacher.</p>
<p>B. EVALUATION ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary teachers will be observed at least twice prior to<br/>February 15 each year. Permanent employees will be observed at least once<br/>every other year prior to April 1.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator will schedule a pre-observation conference based on Form 2 prior<br/>to each formal observation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided below, classroom observations shall last at least 30 minutes;<br/>shall be made known to the unit member at least one day prior to their<br/>occurrence, shall ordinarily be two in number; and shall be followed by an<br/>observation conference within three work days of the observation. The<br/>conference may be scheduled for a later time by mutual agreement. With<br/>agreement of both a permanent unit member and the evaluator, the number of<br/>pre-announced observations may be reduced to one in cases of obviously<br/>satisfactory performance by the unit member.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the minimum number of pre-announced observations, a reasonable<br/>number of unannounced observations may also occur. If the evaluator observes<br/>anything negative in an unannounced observation, it must be communicated in<br/>writing to and discussed with the unit member in a timely manner.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who receives a negative observation report shall have, upon<br/>request of either the evaluator or unit member, a reasonable number of additional<br/>observations, observation conferences, and reports. Such entitlement includes a<br/>pre-observation conference and a post-observation report.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a unit member is rated “needs improvement” on any of the eight<br/>standards, the evaluator shall assist the unit member in correcting any cited<br/>deficiencies. In assisting the unit member, the evaluator may:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make specific recommendations for improvement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide direct assistance to implement such recommendations.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide additional resources to assist with improvement.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select techniques to measure improvement.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a time schedule to monitor progress.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any deficiencies which may have been brought to the attention of the unit<br/>member and subsequently corrected shall be noted as such on the final<br/>evaluation form.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be rated “unsatisfactory” in any standard if he or she<br/>receives unsatisfactory ratings in two or more of the elements of that standard.<br/>Members receiving “unsatisfactory” ratings on two or more standards shall be<br/>given an overall annual rating of “unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a unit member receives an overall annual rating of “unsatisfactory”<br/>based upon Standards 1 through 5, the evaluator shall refer the unit member to<br/>the PAR program as described in Article IX of this contract.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WRITTEN EVALUATION REPORTS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All formal observations shall be reduced to writing, using Form 3 in Appendix A.<br/>The evaluator shall use Form 4 in Appendix A for annual evaluations. The<br/>evaluator will give the evaluatee copies of all completed forms.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signature of the evaluatee on the report shall not imply either agreement or<br/>disagreement with the content of the report.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evaluatee is in disagreement with the content of the report, a statement<br/>may be appended which will become a permanent part of the evaluation report.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation reports filed in the District Office will contain no statement that has not<br/>been made available to the person evaluated prior to its being placed in the<br/>evaluatee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REMEDIAL ACTION</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator is responsible to recommend specific corrective actions or<br/>techniques to the evaluatee regarding any observation or report of unsatisfactory<br/>conduct or performance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee and the evaluator will mutually agree upon the amount of time to<br/>remedy a situation which requires improvement before the next formal<br/>observation or evaluation conference or report. Upon failure to agree, the<br/>disagreement will be resolved by the Superintendent or his/her designee. The</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>employee may respond in writing if he/she does not agree with the<br/>Superintendent’s decision.</p>
<p>3. In the event that remedial action results in satisfactory improvement or</p>
<p>elimination of the problem by the evaluatee, the evaluator shall so note on the<br/>final evaluation form.</p>
<p>E. EVALUATION PERIODS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-evaluation Preparation</p>
<p>a. Appropriate evaluation forms, approved by the District and Association, shall<br/>be given to certificated personnel at a staff meeting within the first month after<br/>the opening of school.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary evaluation conference</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator will provide the evaluatee with a copy of the completed mid-year<br/>evaluation form, including any recommended plan for improvement or<br/>modification to an improvement plan.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, mitigating circumstances may arise<br/>which require modification of the evaluation process. If such revision is<br/>necessary, the evaluator and evaluatee shall attempt by mutual agreement to<br/>establish a revised evaluation process.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee shall be given an opportunity to prepare a written comment<br/>within ten days of receipt of the mid-year conference evaluation form. Such<br/>written comment shall be attached to the report and placed with it in the<br/>evaluatee’s personnel file.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>Discipline imposed under these provisions shall be appropriate to the offense and<br/>may include oral warning, written reprimand, and suspension without pay. “Without<br/>pay” shall mean a unit member’s per diem wage not including fringe benefits.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>1. The primary purpose of intermediate discipline is to attempt to resolve and<br/>remediate the alleged misconduct at the earliest step of intervention. Discipline<br/>shall be progressive as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1 - Oral Warning: An oral warning for an infraction, following a thorough<br/>investigation by the supervisor/designee and a conference with the unit member.<br/>A written statement will be provided the unit member confirming the warning and<br/>advising that future similar behavior will result in possible further discipline.</p>
<p>Step 2 - Written Reprimand: A written reprimand for repeated infractions or more<br/>severe violations. The written reprimand shall follow a thorough investigation by<br/>the supervisor/designee and a conference with the unit member. A copy shall be<br/>placed in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>Step 3 - Suspension: Except in cases of egregious or gross misconduct, a<br/>suspension without pay shall be ordered only after the employee has been given<br/>an oral warning with written confirmation and a written reprimand upon the<br/>occasion of an infraction similar or of the same kind, within 12 months of the first</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>infraction for which personnel action was taken as defined in Step 1, above. Any<br/>such suspension shall be based upon a thorough investigation by the supervisor/<br/>designee.</p>
<p>In the cases of egregious or gross misconduct or if the District believes the unit<br/>member’s conduct may constitute a hazard or possibility of a hazard to<br/>student(s), employee(s), or property, the District may impose a suspension<br/>without pay to be served immediately.

<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any suspension pursuant to this Article shall mean suspension without pay for up<br/>to, but not more than, fifteen working days.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a notice of suspension is given, the employee shall have five days (see definition<br/>in Section A.5. of Article VI) from the receipt of the notice to file a written notice of<br/>appeal with the Superintendent.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension will take place immediately unless the unit member provides notice to<br/>the Superintendent of appeal as delineated in G., above.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of an employee to request an appeal within the time specified shall</p>
<p>constitute a waiver to the right of appeal.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any appeal shall begin at level three of the grievance procedure. At the written</p>
<p>election of the employee filed with the Superintendent in the notice of appeal, an<br/>appeal may be made to the Board of Trustees or to an outside arbitrator. Decisions<br/>of either shall be binding. Once the employee has notified the District of the option,<br/>if any, he/she wishes to pursue, the other option shall not be available to the<br/>employee for that particular action.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator including, but not limited to, per diem</p>

The phrase “full salary” shall be computed so that it<br/>shall not be less than the employee’s “average weekly earnings” under the<br/>Labor Code. The maximum and minimum average weekly earnings set forth<br/>in the Labor Code shall otherwise not be applicable.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day<br/>of authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year,</p>

If the employee continues to receive<br/>temporary disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much of his/her<br/>accumulated sick leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability<br/>indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full<br/>salary.</p>

<p>An applicant who desires to travel must submit a detailed statement of<br/>the proposed itinerary. Travel must be related to the school work of<br/>the employee.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program or statement under (a) or (b), above, shall include plans<br/>to increase the teacher’s knowledge in all or part of the following<br/>general areas:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased knowledge of the teacher’s subject areas.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased understanding of educational psychology.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attainment of better understanding of the problems of the world.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation and Salary Increase</p>
<p>Compensation for teachers shall be fifty percent of whatever the portion of<br/>employment/salary the teacher received during the year leave was granted.<br/>Benefits paid for all other employees will be paid by the District while the<br/>employee is on leave. (Example: Employee A works eighty percent during<br/>the 1993-94 school year and is granted a sabbatical for the 1994-95 school<br/>year. The employee’s compensation during the sabbatical will be fifty percent<br/>of an eighty percent contract. The salary will be computed on the 1994-95<br/>salary schedule.)</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of Fulfillment of Leave</p>
<p>Before returning to duty, each employee returning from leave shall file with<br/>the District Personnel Services Coordinator a transcript of work taken and</p>
<p>48</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria for Selection<br/>The criteria shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program proposed for sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value to be received by pupils and school district from leave.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional attitude.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record of performance in school district.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval of site principal and District Superintendent.</p>

No longevity (step) credit will be given for the year the employee is<br/>on sabbatical leave. (Example: Employee B was on Step 7 when the<br/>sabbatical was granted in 1993-94. The sabbatical was for 1994-95. The<br/>employee would receive fifty percent of the salary the employee would have<br/>received on Step 8. When the employee returns from sabbatical leave, the<br/>employee remains on Step 8 for the 1995-96 school year.)</p>
<p>11. Posting of Bond</p>
<p>Each employee who is granted a sabbatical leave is required to furnish to the<br/>school district a suitable bond in an amount equal to the total compensation<br/>and benefits to be paid to the applicant during said leave of absence. This<br/>bond is to be conditioned so as to reimburse the school district for the amount</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>of salary and benefits paid the applicant while on leave in the event the<br/>applicant fails to render at least two years service in the employ of the school<br/>district following return from the sabbatical leave. The bond shall additionally<br/>guarantee performance by the teacher of the contractual agreement for study<br/>or travel. The bond shall be exonerated in the event the failure of the<br/>employee to return and render two years service is due to death or physical<br/>or mental disability of the employee.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Payment</p>
<p>Compensation shall be paid the employee while on the leave of absence in<br/>the same manner as if the employee were teaching in the District.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effects of Sabbatical Leave on Retirement</p>
<p>The employee’s normal percentage rate of deduction for retirement purposes<br/>shall be applied to the actual salary received by the employee on sabbatical<br/>leave and the District shall continue to pay its legally obligated share. To<br/>qualify for full service credit, the employee may elect to pay both the District<br/>and the employee contributions based upon full contract salary.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by three (3) members of<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee. Two of the members of the<br/>committee shall be appointed by the Association and shall be BOMTA<br/>members in good standing.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Enrollment for the Catastrophic Leave Bank will be announced at the<br/>beginning of the new school year. Contributions shall be made during the<br/>open enrollment period. Members returning from leave who missed the open<br/>enrollment period may contribute within sixty (60) days of returning to work.<br/>Eligible new hires may enroll within sixty (60) days of their first day of<br/>employment if hired after the Open Enrollment period is closed. The District<br/>will supply forms for enrollment/reinstatement to the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank, after the enrollment period, to employees returning from leave and to<br/>eligible, newly hired teachers.</p>

<p>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BANK</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants whose sick leave is exhausted may<br/>withdraw from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury. Catastrophic illness<br/>or injury shall be defined as any illness or injury that incapacitates a unit<br/>member or a member of the unit member’s family for over ten (10)<br/>consecutive duty days which requires the unit member to take time off work to<br/>care him/herself or for that family member. If reoccurrence or a second<br/>illness or injury incapacitates a unit member or member’s family within 12<br/>months, it shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5) consecutive days.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have exhausted sick leave, are eligible for a withdrawal<br/>from the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The district shall pay the unit member full<br/>pay and the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be charged one-half (1/2) day.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member must exhaust all available means of compensation: eg: sick<br/>leave, before qualifying for withdrawal from the bank. The first ten (10) days<br/>of illness or disability must be covered by the unit member’s own sick leave,<br/>differential pay, or leave without pay, the first time said unit member qualifies<br/>for and requests a withdrawal from the Bank. For subsequent withdrawals<br/>within twelve (12) consecutive months, the first (5) duty days of illness must<br/>be covered by the unit member’s own sick leave, differential pay, or leave<br/>without pay. (If a qualifying member is incapacitated and unable to request a<br/>withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank, a family member may submit a<br/>request for the unit member.)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of no<br/>more than 20 duty days. Unit members may submit requests for extensions<br/>of withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A unit member’s withdrawal from<br/>the bank may not exceed the statutory maximum period of twelve (12)<br/>consecutive months.</p>
<p>6. If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days<br/>remaining in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be returned to the then<br/>current members of the Bank proportionately.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall not be subject to Article VI Grievance<br/>Procedure in the Agreement between the Black Oak Mine Unified School District<br/>and the Black Oak Mine Teachers Association.</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the eligibility determination, the unit member shall meet with the<br/>site administrator and agree in writing to the unit member’s non-teaching<br/>duties as described in Article 12 of this Agreement. If the site administrator<br/>and the unit member cannot reach a mutual agreement, the duties shall<br/>be mutually determined by the Superintendent and the unit member.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary</p>
<p>Unit members participating in the program shall be placed on the salary<br/>schedule and advance on the salary schedule in the same manner as if they<br/>had been working full-time. While a unit member is participating in this program,</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits</p>
<p>The employee shall receive health and welfare benefits pursuant to<br/>Government Code Section 53201 in the same manner as a full-time employee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savings Provision</p>
<p>The Part-Time Teaching With Full Retirement Credit (Willie Brown Act) program<br/>is authorized by the California Education Code provisions pertaining to part-<br/>time teaching with full retirement credit (Sections 22713 and 44922), and if<br/>those Education Code provisions are repealed during the term of this<br/>Agreement, this section shall become inoperative.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relationship To Other District Retirement Programs</p>
<p>Participation in this program does not preclude a unit member from participating<br/>in another District retirement program. However, the unit member shall not<br/>participate concurrently in this program and another District retirement program.</p>
<p>L. Job-Sharing</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-sharing shall refer two (2) unit members on regular contracts sharing<br/>one (1) teaching assignment. Two unit members may share an assignment<br/>for a minimum of one (1) year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job applications for a job-sharing assignment for the following school year<br/>shall be filed with the District no later than March 1. Applications shall not<br/>be denied except for just cause. The District shall approve or deny requests<br/>and notify, in writing, the applicants of its decision by May 1. If a request is<br/>denied, the applicants shall be notified, in writing, of the specific reasons for</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>the denial. The forms for the job share procedure and agreement can be<br/>obtained upon request from the District Office.</p>
<p>3. Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, job-sharing unit</p>
<p>members’ wages, benefits, and paid leaves shall be prorated relative to the<br/>actual time worked. In no event shall the total amount of health and welfare<br/>benefits for the job-sharers exceed the amount the District would have paid<br/>if the position had not been shared.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-sharing unit members shall earn appropriate salary schedule<br/>increments in accordance with the salary schedule.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of the two unit members, a job-sharing assignment may be<br/>renewed provided the two unit members notify the District prior to March</p>
<p>1. In the event the two unit members fail to notify the District of their<br/>desire to continue the job-sharing assignment, or in the event the District<br/>does not approve the continuance of the assignment, the unit members<br/>shall be returned to full-time assignments.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member on a regular contract is in a job-sharing assignment and<br/>elects to return to full-time teaching, the unit member shall be reassigned<br/>in accordance with Article VII (transfer/reassignment) of this agreement.</p>
<p>55</p><h6>ARTICLE XIV</h6><h6>COMPLAINTS AGAINST EMPLOYEES</h6>
<p>The District employs persons who are properly licensed and credentialed and therefore<br/>are presumed to be competent and professional. The District trusts its employees and<br/>assumes that in all instances they conduct themselves properly. Complaints will not be<br/>deemed accurate or true unless and until the facts indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure regulates the manner in which the administration will respond to<br/>the complaint of a parent/guardian of a pupil or other adult member of the public<br/>against an employee.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complainant is a person who makes an oral or written complaint about an<br/>employee and requests that adverse action be taken against the employee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration will attempt to obtain, at the lowest administrative level<br/>possible, a timely and appropriate resolution of any complaint.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any meeting with an employee under this procedure, the employee may have<br/>an Association representative present.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification</p>
<p>An employee shall be orally notified of the substance of the complaint within five<br/>work days after the administrator has received the complaint. [Exception: when a<br/>law enforcement official requests in writing a delay in notification. At the<br/>completion of the law enforcement investigation, the employee shall be notified.]<br/>The employee shall have an opportunity to discuss the allegations with the<br/>administrator before any meeting with the complainant. If the administrator<br/>determines that the complaint is false or without merit, the employee shall be<br/>notified of that determination and no further action shall be taken and no record<br/>shall be made of the complaint.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting with Complainant</p>
<p>Either an administrator or the employee may request that a meeting be<br/>scheduled involving the complainant, the employee, and an administrator.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint Reduced to Writing</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>If the complaint is not resolved by the above actions or dropped and the<br/>complainant desires further action, the following will apply:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten work days after the administrator notifies the complainant of<br/>his/her final disposition of the complaint, the complaint shall be put in<br/>writing.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written complaint shall include the complainant’s name, the specific<br/>allegations, the reason why the complainant is not satisfied with the<br/>previous attempts at resolution (if applicable), and the complainant’s<br/>desired resolution of the matter.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the complaint shall be given to the employee.</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complainant fails or refuses to put the complaint in writing, the<br/>complaint will be deemed dropped by the complainant. However, the<br/>administrator may continue to review the complaint and may take<br/>corrective action when appropriate or make recommendations to the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>v. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS: Due to the inability of the District to<br/>inquire further into an anonymous complaint and inability of an employee<br/>to confront the anonymous complainant, anonymous complaints will be<br/>viewed with a high degree of skepticism. However, the administration<br/>may investigate the anonymous complaint in a reasonable and sensitive<br/>manner. If the administration investigates an anonymous complaint, the<br/>employee will be informed of the complaint within 5 days after the<br/>complaint is received, and if the anonymous complaint was a written<br/>complaint, a copy of the complaint will be given to the employee within<br/>the same time period. The employee shall give his/her immediate<br/>supervisor his/her response to the claims in the complaint within ten<br/>work days after being informed of the complaint.</p>
<p>vi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten work days after receiving the written complaint, the<br/>employee shall file with the administrator a written response to the<br/>complaint.</p>
<p>vii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration shall determine whether additional efforts at the<br/>site to resolve the complaint would be productive.</p>
<p>D. APPEAL TO DISTRICT LEVEL</p>
<p>If the administrator determines that further efforts to resolve the complaint at the site<br/>would not be productive, the administrator shall prepare a memo to the<br/>Superintendent describing his/her attempts to resolve the complaint, and shall<br/>forward the written complaint, the employee’s response, and the administrator’s</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>memo to the Superintendent for review. The Superintendent will review the<br/>complaint, the employee’s response, and the administrator’s memo, and may meet<br/>with the administrator, the employee, and/or the complainant to clarify issues and<br/>attempt to resolve the complaint. The disposition of the complaint by the<br/>Superintendent shall be final unless within fourteen days after receiving notification<br/>of the disposition of the complaint, the complainant requests in writing a meeting<br/>with the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>E. APPEAL TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES</p>
<p>If the complainant desires to meet with the Board of Trustees regarding the<br/>complaint, he/she shall request such a meeting in writing and shall include a<br/>statement regarding why the proposed resolutions at the lower levels are not<br/>acceptable. The Superintendent shall review the complaint and the proposed<br/>resolution at each level and shall make such recommendations to the Board as<br/>he/she deems appropriate. If the Board decides to meet with the complainant, the<br/>Board will schedule such a meeting at the Board’s convenience and meet with the<br/>complainant in closed session. Before the Board finally resolves any such complaint<br/>adversely to the employee, either at that meeting or a subsequent meeting, the<br/>employee will be provided an opportunity to meet with the Board in closed session<br/>regarding the accuracy of the complaint and any other matter regarding the<br/>complaint.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A School Nurse is a holder of a School Nurse Services Credential.<br/>In the event that the district is unable to hire a School Nurse, the District may<br/>hire a registered nurse who has attained a bachelor’s degree and a<br/>preliminary credential, and who will earn a clear School Nurse Services<br/>Credential within five years of the hire date. A School Nurse with a clear<br/>credential will be given year for year credit for experience as a School Nurse<br/>in any public school system. A School Nurse with comparable experience<br/>may be placed up to step five. A clear credential is required to advance<br/>beyond step 5 of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the District is unable to hire a qualified School Nurse,<br/>the District may contract with other LEAs for School Nurse services.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Education Code Section 45028 and effective July 1,2008,<br/>the district will grant experience credit for salary placement for up to twelve<br/>years experience. Placement on the salary schedule for new employees will<br/>be on the condition that the new hire has comparable units and years of<br/>experience of those required of the current unit members for placement on<br/>the salary schedule.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member who has a Professional Clear Resource Specialist<br/>Credential and who teaches in a Resource Specialist Program shall receive a<br/>stipend of $1,000 per year. Unit members who teach in the Resource<br/>Specialist Program under an emergency permit shall receive a stipend of<br/>$500 per year. The resource specialist stipend shall be pro-rated for any<br/>eligible teacher employed less than full-time (1 FTE). The stipend shall also<br/>be pro-rated for any teacher whose assignment is partially in the resource<br/>specialist program and partially in a regular education program. The teacher<br/>will be paid the same fraction of the stipend that his or her RSP assignment is<br/>of 1 FTE. Any teacher holding a resource specialist credential with caseload<br/>responsibility and providing special education services to resource students<br/>outside of the RSP program shall be paid a portion of the RSP stipend<br/>equivalent to the portion of his or her salary paid from special education funds<br/>or the pro-rated % of RSP students (if 0% of their salary is paid from special<br/>education funds).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each self-governed school will have positions such as School Facilitator,<br/>facilities Coordinator, Directed Academic Studies (D.A.S.) Coordinator and<br/>Parent Outreach/Education Coordinator. By October 1 of each year, each<br/>self-governed school will notify the Superintendent or designee of the<br/>stipends allotted to each position and the staff member(s) serving in each<br/>position. It is recognized that part of the allotment may be used to pay for<br/>classified staff members. Self Governance stipends are listed in Appendix B.</p>
<p>B. HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees’ medical, dental, and vision coverage is with California’s Valued<br/>Trust, including Kaiser, and Blue Cross plans listed in Appendix J, Delta Dental<br/>and Vision Service Plan. Any proposal to leave California’s Valued Trust and<br/>apply to another insurance carrier will be subject exclusively to the collective<br/>bargaining process. The maximum level of District contribution toward the cost<br/>of employee medical, dental, and vision plans shall be $800.00/month/full-time<br/>eligible employee, subject to renegotiation each year. In the event the cost of<br/>employee medical, dental, and vision plans exceeds the maximum level of<br/>District contribution, no employee will be required to pay more than the difference<br/>between the maximum level of District contribution and the actual cost of<br/>medical, dental, and vision plans for that employee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning October 1, 1997, the maximum payable benefit for Delta Dental will be</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>$2,000 per calendar year.</p>
<p>3. Effective October 1, 1998, the District will establish an Internal Revenue Code<br/>Section 125 Flexible Fringe Benefit Plan.</p>
<p>C. EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of Plan</p>
<p>In the 2007-08 school year, the District shall offer an early retirement incentive as<br/>provided below which shall be available for unit members who apply by April 30,<br/>2008. This early retirement incentive shall then be offered every three years<br/>thereafter. Upon mutual agreement between the district and the association, the<br/>district may offer additional early retirement incentive opportunities. For<br/>subsequent school years, the availability of the plan shall be announced by the<br/>district no later than December 15 of that school year and unit members must<br/>apply no later than March 1.</p>
<p>Unit members who are at least 55 years of age on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of school, of the<br/>school year in which they apply for retirement, and who have at least 10 years of<br/>service with the District may apply for an early retirement package under the<br/>provisions of this article.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terms of the Plan</p>
<p>The Plan shall not cost the District more than the anticipated savings to the<br/>District in salary and benefits for the first two years of the unit member’s<br/>retirement. The anticipated savings will be calculated based on the difference<br/>between the total compensation earnable in the next two years by the member<br/>and the two years total compensation of a teacher who would start on column III,<br/>step 6, using the salary schedule in effect on the date of retirement. The total<br/>amount payable as an early retirement incentive to any unit member shall be<br/>determined by the District and in no case shall said amount be less than % of the<br/>anticipated savings. Total compensation includes salary, statutory benefits and<br/>District provided benefits. The Plan for a particular unit member may include but<br/>need not be limited to, one or more of the following components:</p>
<p>Unit members who elect to receive the retirement incentive may receive some or<br/>all of the incentive in the form of a one-time payment following the effective date<br/>of retirement.</p>
<p>Health insurance benefits for the unit member and/or his/her spouse until the unit<br/>member turns 65 years of age, either with or without a member contribution.</p>
<p>The reduction from full-time employment to part-time employment while accruing</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>a full year of service credit in the State Teachers’ Retirement System under the<br/>provisions of the “Willie Brown” program, Education Code Sections 22713 and<br/>44922.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUBSTITUTIONS DURING PREPARATION PERIOD; TIME BANK</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of a time bank can be initiated by the site administrator to facilitate<br/>finding unit members willing to substitute in classes. It is not to be initiated by<br/>staff, although staff may inform the site administrator of willingness to participate<br/>in covering classes.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of a time bank is for a unit member to assist the site administrator<br/>by substituting in a class and earning time to go into a time bank. When the unit<br/>member’s time equals that of a full teaching day, the unit member is entitled to a<br/>day off work with pay. Upon mutual consent of the unit member and site<br/>administrator, the time off may be given in half-day or smaller increments, even<br/>though the general idea is to do so in whole day increments.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member still has time in the bank monthly, the unit member will receive<br/>pay equal to the portion of a teaching day that was banked multiplied by the daily<br/>substitute rate.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individualized Professional Development Plans</p>
<p>By October 15th, each unit member shall develop, with the participation and<br/>approval of his/her site administrator or superintendent’s designee, a program of<br/>professional development which includes at least the following:</p>
<p>Training deemed necessary or desirable to enable the unit member to assist in<br/>the achievement of District goals set by the Board of Trustees;</p>
<p>Areas identified for professional growth in the evaluation process described in<br/>Article VIII.</p>
<p>The plan may be amended at any time by mutual consent of the member and site<br/>administrator or superintendent’s designee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professional Development Plan may include, but is not limited to, some or all<br/>of the following:</p>
<p>♦ Staff development programs offered by the District or other educational<br/>agencies;</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accredited University and College Courses;</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities undertaken by the unit member prerequisite to the renewal of a<br/>professional clear credential under Education Code Section 44277 and Title<br/>5, California Code of Regulations Sections 80550 through 80569;</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in educational association conferences and workshops;</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities undertaken to achieve certification by the National Board for<br/>Professional Teaching Standards.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units for column movement must be for activities approved as part of the<br/>member’s professional development plan. Coursework for salary schedule credit<br/>must be pre-approved by the administrator responsible for that employee’s<br/>professional development plan. A copy of the form in Appendix K will be signed<br/>by the administrator before the unit member takes the class. The unit member<br/>will send a copy of the form to the Personnel Coordinator. Any approved units<br/>turned in by the last working day of September will be used for salary schedule<br/>placement that year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may pay some or all of the costs associated with completion of<br/>activities approved as part of a member’s plan.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will add a stipend of $1,000 per year to the salary schedule for unit<br/>members who receive National Board Certification.</p>
<p>6. INCENTIVE AWARDS</p>
<p>The District will bear no costs associated with monetary awards paid by the state to<br/>individual teachers. All costs, such as Workers Compensation, unemployment<br/>insurance, Medicare, and STRS, will be deducted from the gross amount of the<br/>award before issuance.</p>
<p>7. ACTIVITIES DIRECTORS</p>
<p>The Middle and High School Activities Directors will each receive one period to<br/>prepare for student activities or will be paid the equivalent of one additional period.<br/>The High School Activities Director will also receive a stipend as described in<br/>Appendix B.</p>
<p>63</p><h6>ARTICLE XVI<br/>SNOW AND OUTAGE DAYS</h6>
<p>A. Any day(s) on which the District schools are declared closed by the Superintendent<br/>due to snow, utility outage(s), or other reasons beyond the control of the District are<br/>collectively referred to for convenience as “Snow Days”. “Compensation” as used<br/>herein shall mean a unit member’s per diem wage, not including fringe benefits.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will declare “snow days” at least sixty minutes prior to the beginning<br/>of the school day. The District will make every reasonable attempt to notify<br/>teachers of the snow day. Compensation will be granted if a “snow day” is<br/>declared less than sixty minutes before the beginning of the school day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event there are more “snow days” than the number of snow makeup days<br/>in the adopted in the school calendar, the following procedures will be used for<br/>making up that day or days:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is feasible to work on a snow day, certificated employees may work at<br/>their sites on that day.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may elect, with pre-approval from the site administrator, to<br/>make up the day through professional development or special assignment<br/>within a week of the end of the school year. Working on a weekend or<br/>over a school break is permissible, although it is not appropriate to work at<br/>home.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may use a Compelling Leave day as long as the maximum<br/>days allowable by contract have not already been used.</p>
<p>64</p><h6>ARTICLE XVII<br/>CONSULTATION</h6>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association has the right to consult on the definition of educational objectives,<br/>the determination of the content of courses and curriculum, and the selection of<br/>textbooks to the extent such matters are within the discretion of the District under<br/>law as specified in the California Education Code.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall give written notice to the Association that action on any matter<br/>of consultation, as defined herein, is being considered. Such notice shall be<br/>given to provide sufficient time for the parties to meet ad consult in good faith.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may exercise its right to consult on proposed Board action(s) (as<br/>delineated in A) by requesting consultation on the subjects.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall consider such presentations made by the Association prior to<br/>arriving at a determination of policy or course of action.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FULL INCLUSION</p>
<p>The District and Association recognize that full inclusion of students with disabilities<br/>into the regular classrooms of the schools results in unusual situations that are best<br/>resolved through consensus of any affected staff and administrative employees. A<br/>district wide committee is hereby created, including the Superintendent and his/her<br/>designee, the full inclusion site administrator or his/her designee, the full inclusion<br/>site special education or resource teacher from the full inclusion site, and the<br/>teachers of the affected classrooms/ programs, to review and decide upon how<br/>matters brought to the committee’s attention will be resolved.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will meet within the first two weeks of school to assess the<br/>needs of the affected students and the programs they attend. Additional<br/>meetings may be called, based upon urgent need for action, by mutual<br/>agreement of the Superintendent or his/her designee and one other school site<br/>member of the committee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee’s jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the need for additional funds to support the full inclusion classroom and<br/>staff;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;training of staff;</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning for full inclusion;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coordination of efforts to comply with I.E.P. elements;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aide services and time;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class size;</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classroom facilities; and</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notification and equitable assignment of teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee may make decisions only by consensus, i.e., the unanimous<br/>agreement of all members present, and one of those agreeing must be the<br/>Superintendent (or his/her designee).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each year of the term of this master agreement between BOMTA and the<br/>District, the subject of full inclusion will be an automatic reopener.</p>
<p>66</p><h6>ARTICLE XVIII<br/>MAINTENANCE/APPLICATION OF STANDARDS</h6>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement or any application of the Agreement to any<br/>employee or group of employees is held to be contrary to law by a court of<br/>competent jurisdiction, then such provision or application shall not be deemed valid<br/>and subsisting, except to the extent permitted by law; all other provisions or<br/>applications shall continue in full force and effect. It is further agreed that within ten<br/>days of receipt of notification of the court’s decision, negotiations shall commence<br/>regarding matters related to such provision.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association will establish, when needed, an ad hoc Joint<br/>Committee for Class Size to recommend solutions for concerns about excessive<br/>class size. The committee shall be made up of an equal number of district<br/>representatives and BOMTA representatives. The committee shall meet within 2<br/>weeks from receipt of the appeal in order to develop solutions to resolve the issue.<br/>The committee may, by majority vote, make a formal recommendation to the Board.</p>
