<p>ARTICLE 10 - LEAVE PROVISIONS</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement - Every unit member is entitled to a leave of absence not to<br/>exceed three (3) days or five (5) days if out-of-state travel or intra-state travel<br/>exceeding 500 miles round trip is required, on account of death of any member<br/>of the immediate family.

<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illness or Injury - The District will provide for leave of absence of a unit member<br/>and will grant compensation to them when they are compelled to be absent<br/>because of illness, accident or quarantine. The cause of the illness or accident<br/>need not arise out of and in the course of employment. A full time unit member<br/>is entitled to ten (10) days fully-paid leave each year for illness or injury. The<br/>unused amount of leave allowed in any school year shall be accumulated<br/>without limit from year to year. Part time unit members are entitled to a<br/>proportionate leave. The ten (10) days leave granted each year may be used<br/>at any time when needed during the school year.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Illness - A unit member has a statutory right to differential<br/>compensation for an absence for five (5) months or less, with such pay<br/>commencing immediately upon exhaustion of all sick leave.</p>
<p>When a unit member is absent because of illness or injury for a period of five<br/>(5) school months or less, the amount deducted from the salary due for any<br/>month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum actually paid a<br/>substitute.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Entitlement of the up to five-month differential pay is per illness/accident.<br/>However, if a school year terminates before the five month period is exhausted;<br/>the employee may take the balance of the five-month period in the subsequent<br/>school year. When a unit member is absent because of illness or other causes<br/>for a period of more than five (5) school months, the amount deducted from<br/>his/her regular salary for the months in which the absence occurs shall be<br/>determined according to the rules established by the District.</p>
<p>10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of Illness - Consistent with board policy and upon request from the<br/>District, a doctor’s note may be required for sick leave that is chronic, reflects a<br/>pattern of absence, is in excess of five consecutive days, or whenever clear<br/>evidence indicates that an absence is not related to an illness.</p>
<p>10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity - Any days of leave for illness or injury may be used by unit<br/>members, at their election, in cases of personal necessity.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the immediate family.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident, involving their person or property, or the person or property of<br/>a member of the immediate family.</p>
<p>A maximum of seven (7) days of accumulated leave may be used in any school<br/>year for the purposes enumerated above.</p>
<p>Unit members must obtain advance permission prior to taking such leave<br/>except in those situations specifically enumerated in this section.</p>
<p>Personal necessity leave shall not be taken for the purpose of personal<br/>business which can be attended to during non-duty hours; a strike or any other<br/>activities related to a work stoppage; or extension of a holiday or vacation<br/>period. (If directly adjacent to a holiday or the winter or spring vacation period,<br/>specific reasons are required.)</p>
<p>Unit members may not be prohibited from using personal necessity leave to<br/>observe major religious holidays.</p>
<p>If the District has reason to believe that this section has been violated, it may<br/>request verification.</p>
<p>Two (2) of the seven (7) personal necessity days may be taken without prior<br/>approval from the District, provided that, in addition to the above requirements,<br/>all the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1. The unit member must give the District office at least three (3) working<br/>days notice prior to the leave day.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>2. No more than two (2) unit members per school may be absent on such<br/>leave during any one (1) duty day.</p>

<p>The District is required to grant leave with pay when it is necessary to do so in<br/>order that leaves of absence caused or contributed by pregnancy, miscarriage,<br/>or childbirth be treated the same as leaves for illness, injury or disability.</p>
<p>Any unit member shall have the right to utilize sick leave and extended sick<br/>leave provided for by law for absences necessitated by pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom.</p>
<p>10.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternitv/Paternitv Leave: STRS Credit</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of leave is not accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to begin on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member absent on this leave shall be paid such portions of salary<br/>due, which when added to any temporary disability indemnity, will not be<br/>more than full salary.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leave is reduced by one day for each day of absence, regardless of<br/>a temporary disability indemnity.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this leave overlaps into the next school year, the unit member is<br/>entitled only to the amount of leave due him/her for the same illness or<br/>injury.</p>
<p>10.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial Leave</p>
<p>The District may grant leaves of absence for any unit member called for jury<br/>duty. In order for the unit member to receive their daily pay while serving on<br/>jury duty, they shall:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit the court form indicating the time/days served; and</p>

<p>10.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial and Official Appearances</p>
<p>The District may grant leaves to appear as a witness in court other than as a<br/>litigant, or to respond to any official order from another governmental agency<br/>for reasons not brought about by a unit member’s connivance or misconduct.</p>
<p>10.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability Allowance Applicants</p>
<p>The District may grant leaves of absence to any unit member who has applied<br/>for disability allowance, not to exceed thirty (30) days beyond final<br/>determination of the disability allowance by the State Teachers Retirement<br/>System. If the unit member is eligible for the disability allowance, the leave is<br/>extended for the term of the disability, but not to exceed thirty-nine (39) months<br/>from the date of approval of the disability allowance.</p>
<p>10.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Employee Organization Officer</p>
<p>The District shall grant to any unit member, upon request, a leave without loss<br/>of pay to serve as any elected officer of a statewide public employee<br/>organization, national organization, or local school district public employee<br/>organization which is affiliated with such state or national organizations. The<br/>District pays the unit member’s salary and unit member’s retirement<br/>contributions and is reimbursed for all compensation by the Romoland<br/>Teachers Association.</p>
<p>10.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boards, Committees, Commissions, Groups</p>
<p>The District shall grant to any unit member, upon request, a leave without loss<br/>of pay to serve on a specified list of state boards, committees, commissions, or <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>11</p>
<p>groups. Such leave is limited to twenty (20) days per year and the organization<br/>reimburses the District for the unit member’s compensation.</p>
<p>10.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Service</p>
<p>Any unit member is entitled to a leave of absence for military service during war<br/>or a national emergency. Such absence does not affect the classification of the<br/>unit member, but the service does not count either as a break in service or as<br/>time toward achieving permanent classification. Upon returning, the unit<br/>member is entitled to the position held prior to military service, and to the salary<br/>to which he/she would have been entitled had there been no absence.</p>
<p>10.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect of Probationary Employees</p>
<p>Leaves granted to probationary teachers do not constitute a break in service in<br/>meeting the continuity-of-service required for classification as a permanent<br/>teacher. The leave, however, does not count as probationary service to the<br/>District.</p>
<p>10.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstatement Following Leaves</p>
<p>After expiration of the leave, unit members shall, unless otherwise agreed, be<br/>reinstated in a position held prior to a leave.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave without pay or other benefits may be granted to a unit member.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall request such leave thirty (30) days prior to the<br/>date on which the leave is to begin. Such request shall be in writing.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date on which the leave shall begin and the duration shall be at the<br/>discretion of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of such leave shall be no more than twelve (12)<br/>consecutive months and shall automatically terminate on June 30 of the<br/>school year in which it was granted. A unit member on such leave shall<br/>notify the District Office by May 1 of the school year as to intent to return<br/>to employment in the District. Failure to notify will be considered<br/>position abandonment.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is not entitled to the use of any accrued sick leave or<br/>other paid leave while on such status.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no loss of employment status for such leave.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>10.18 Catastrophic Leave Program</p>
<p>Upon request of a unit member, the District may establish a catastrophic leave<br/>program in accordance with Education Code 44043.5 to permit employees to<br/>donate eligible leave credits to another employee if the employee or a family<br/>member suffers from a catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>10.19 The Association President or designee shall be provided a total of five (5) days<br/>of release time at no loss of salary or other benefits for the purpose of<br/>participating in Association activities and/or conferences.</p>

<p>Performance Evaluations</p>
<p>Needs of the District and/or school</p>
<p>Experience</p>
<p>If these factors are equal between two or more qualified applicants, as<br/>determined by the District, experience shall be a priority consideration. The<br/>District’s determination shall be final.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an applicant’s request for voluntary transfer is denied, the applicant shall be<br/>granted, upon request, a meeting with the administrator who denied the request<br/>to discuss the reasons for the denial. Written reasons for the denial will be<br/>provided upon request.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application for a voluntary transfer shall not jeopardize the unit member’s<br/>current assignment. A request for transfer may be withdrawn by the unit<br/>member making it at any time, unless commitment for replacement has been<br/>made by the District.</p>
<p>Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may make involuntary transfers at any time for the following<br/>educationally sound reasons:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish or maintain reasonable staff balance in male-female ratios.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish or maintain a proper ethnic distribution of employees<br/>throughout the work sites.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish or maintain necessary capabilities at any school for<br/>bilingual instruction, or any other form of specialized program.</p>

Written reasons for the involuntary transfer will be<br/>provided upon request.</p>
<p>12.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time permits, and dependent on the specific reasons for the need for and<br/>involuntary transfer, prior to said transfer, the District will ask for volunteers to<br/>fill the vacancy. The District will consider a volunteer request; however, the<br/>needs and efficient operation of the District will govern the decision whether to<br/>select a voluntary transfer. A teacher volunteering to transfer who is not<br/>selected shall receive written reasons for the denial upon written request.</p>
<p>Reassignment</p>
<p>12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignments may be implemented by the site administrator, taking into<br/>consideration unit member requests and the needs and efficient operation of<br/>the District. Prior to making reassignment, the administrator shall give the unit<br/>member five (5) calendar days’ oral and written notice. If a reassignment<br/>request by a unit member is denied, written reasons for the denial will be<br/>provided upon request.</p>
<p>12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall be given written notice of the next year’s assignment<br/>not later than fifteen (15) calendar days before the last day of school. Such<br/>notice shall specify the site, grade level or specialists area to which a unit<br/>member will be assigned. However, nothing precludes the District from<br/>revising the assignment if the instructional needs of students warrant revision.</p>
<p>Release Time</p>
<p>12.11 Unit members who are transferred or reassigned during the school year shall<br/>be allowed three (3) days of release time for preparation prior to the effective<br/>date of the transfer or reassignment. Unit members who are involuntarily<br/>transferred more than two grade levels up or down from their present grade<br/>level assignment, and are notified of this assignment change prior to the<br/>beginning of the school year, will be provided the equivalent of three paid<br/>summer work days for preparation. Unit members who are involuntarily<br/>transferred more than two grade levels up or down from their present grade<br/>level assignment, and are notified of this assignment during the school year,<br/>will be allowed the equivalent of four days of release time for preparation.<br/>Alternative arrangements for release time may be established by mutual<br/>agreement between the unit member and the Assistant Superintendent or<br/>designee.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>12.12 The District shall provide assistance in the moving of the unit member’s<br/>material who are transferring. Every effort shall be made to deliver the unit<br/>member’s materials prior to the start of the unit member’s release time.</p>

<p>APPENDIX H</p>
<p>Agreement Between Romoland School District</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Romoland Teachers Association<br/>STANDARDS BASED EVALUATION PROCESS</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The evaluation process is designed to assist the Unit Member in improving his/her performance<br/>and to acknowledge individual strengths. This can best be achieved in a supportive, cooperative<br/>atmosphere. Ongoing informal classroom visits by the site administrator throughout the year will foster<br/>this atmosphere, and will complement formal classroom observations. The expectation is that<br/>administrators will devote as much time as needed to support Unit Members in their professional<br/>development.</p>
<p>The Teaching Standards referred to in the following evaluation process are the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession. A copy of these Teaching Standards and their key elements, as<br/>well as a written explanation of the evaluation process, will be given to all Unit Members prior to<br/>implementation of this plan. Unit Members new to the District will receive this information at the time of<br/>initial employment.</p>
<p>All Probationary, Intern, and Temporary Unit Members will be evaluated pursuant to legal<br/>requirements, using the process described on pages 2-4. Permanent Unit Members who have completed<br/>at least three years of teaching in the District and have met Standards during the prior evaluation period<br/>may choose to be evaluated using Option I or Option II. Option II requires the approval of the site<br/>administrator when an evaluatee receives a “partially meets Standards” or “does not meet Standards”<br/>during the prior evaluation period.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>NON-PERMANENT UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>Year One Probationary. Intern, and Temporary Unit Members</p>
<p>The primary focus in the evaluation of first year Probationary, Intern, and Temporary Unit Members<br/>shall be on coaching, support and feedback related to the Teaching Standards. Non-Permanent Unit<br/>Members shall be evaluated each year, as required by law, in order to determine whether or not the<br/>individual is meeting the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>Feedback will be provided on all six Teaching Standards each year. First year Probationary,<br/>Intern, and Temporary Unit Members will focus on the following Teaching Standards, looking at Key<br/>elements under each Teaching Standard:</p>
<p>Standard 2: Creating and Maintaining an Effective Environment for Student Learning<br/>Standard 4: Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for All<br/>Standard 6: Developing as a Professional Educator<br/>Submission of Performance Plans for determining the Teaching Standards and Key Elements:</p>
<p>The first year Probationary, Intern, or Temporary Unit Members will meet with his/her evaluator<br/>within 45 calendar days of the start of the school year to discuss the evaluation process and the three<br/>following Teaching Standards: Standard 2, Standard 4, and Standard 6.</p>
<p>Formal Observations:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-observation Conference</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Observation: Minimum of twenty continuous minutes</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Conference: Except for unforeseen circumstances, no later than three<br/>working days after observation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Written Summary: No later than ten working days after observation.<br/>Meeting to discuss this written observation not required.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Formal Observations: No more than one in any five day working period.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Formal Observations: Minimum of two, maximum of three (more by mutual<br/>agreement)</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Post Observation Conference will be centered around, but not limited to, identified Teaching<br/>Standards of focus so that feedback is meaningful. The site administrator will offer support, methods<br/>and/or ideas as needed. In addition, informal classroom visits by the administrator throughout the year will<br/>foster dialogue and support.</p>
<p>Continuing Probationary. Intern and Temporary Unit Members</p>
<p>The primary focus in the evaluation of continuing Probationary, Intern, and Temporary Unit<br/>Members shall be on coaching, support and feedback related to the Teaching Standards. Feedback will<br/>be provided on all six Teaching Standards each year. Non-permanent Unit Members shall be evaluated<br/>each year, as required by law in order to determine whether or not the individual is meeting the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>Within forty-five calendar days following the first day of school, the Continuing Probationary, Intern,<br/>or Temporary Unit Member will meet with his/her evaluator to review the Teaching Standards of focus for<br/>the evaluation year. Continuing Probationary, Intern, or Temporary Unit Members will focus on positive<br/>progress toward three new Teaching Standards, looking at key elements Under each Teaching Standard<br/>to identify specific areas</p>
<p>The three new Teaching Standards are:</p>
<p>Standard 1: Engaging and Supporting All Students in Learning<br/>Standard 3: Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter Knowledge<br/>Standard 5: Assessing Student Learning</p>
<p>The Probationary, Intern, or Temporary Unit Member will continue to work on Teaching Standards<br/>of focus from the first year. Standard Six, “Developing as a Professional Educator,” is expected to be<br/>addressed on a yearly basis as part of the terms and conditions for employment in the Romoland School<br/>District.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Intern and Temporary Unit Members with more than two years of service will be evaluated in odd<br/>years (third, fifth, etc.) on Teaching Standards 2, 4, 6 and in even years (fourth, sixth, etc.) on Teaching<br/>Standards 1, 3, 5, 6.</p>
<p>Formal Observations:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-observation Conference</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Observation: Minimum of twenty continuous minutes</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Conference: Except for unforeseen circumstances, no later than three<br/>working days after observation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Written Summary:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;later&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ten working days after observation.</p>
<p>Meeting to discuss this written observation not required.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Formal Observations: No more than one in any five day period.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Formal Observations: Minimum of two, maximum of three (more by mutual<br/>agreement).</p>
<p>Post Observation Conference will be centered around, but not limited to, identified Teaching<br/>Standards of focus so that feedback is meaningful. The site administrator will offer support, methods<br/>and/or ideas as needed. In addition, informal classroom visits by the administrator throughout the year will<br/>foster dialogue and support.</p>
<p>PERMANENT UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>The primary focus in the evaluation of Permanent Unit Members shall be on coaching, support,<br/>professional development and feedback related to the six Teaching Standards. Permanent Unit Members<br/>shall be evaluated at least every two years. Permanent Unit Members with at least three years teaching<br/>experience in the District may have available Option I or Option II with the approval of the site<br/>administrator. Unit Members with permanent status, who have been employed at least 10 years with the<br/>school district, are highly qualified as defined in 20 U.C.S. Sec. 7801 (ESEA), and whose previous<br/>evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards may be evaluated up to every five</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>years if the unit member and evaluator consent to this schedule. Should the evaluator withdraw consent,<br/>notice and reasons shall be provided to the unit member in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Option I</p>
<p>Within forty-five calendar days following the first day of school, the Permanent Unit Member will<br/>meet with the site administrator to set goals and to establish an evaluation plan. Feedback will be<br/>provided on all six Teaching Standards in the evaluation. The administrator will provide feedback in the<br/>“overall standard” column and substandard columns for those agreed upon focus standards. For all other<br/>standards the administrator will provide feedback only in the “overall standard” column and may also<br/>provide additional comments. Specific areas of focus will be identified by looking at key elements under<br/>each Teaching Standard. One Teaching Standard or key element(s) within that Teaching Standard may<br/>be added at the discretion of the site administrator in consultation with the Unit Member. The Permanent<br/>Unit Member may then choose only to focus on the administrator’s selected Teaching Standard or key<br/>element(s).</p>
<p>Formal Observations:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-observation Conference</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Observation: Minimum of twenty continuous minutes</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Conference: Except for unforeseen circumstances, no later than three<br/>working days after observation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Written Summary: No later than ten working days after observation.<br/>Meeting to discuss this written observation not required.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Formal Observations: No more than one in any five day period.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Formal Observations: Permanent Unit Members - Minimum of one, maximum of<br/>three (more by mutual agreement).</p>
<p>Post Observation Conference will be centered around, but not limited to, identified Teaching<br/>Standards of focus so that feedback is meaningful. The administrator will offer continued support and<br/>coaching through dialogue and informal classroom visits throughout the year.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Option II</p>
<p>Option II is available to all Permanent Unit Members who have completed at least three years of<br/>teaching experience in the District and have “met Standards” during the prior evaluation. Option II may<br/>be available to evaluatees who “partially meet” or “does not meet Standards” based on the prior<br/>evaluation with the approval of the administrator. Once Option II has been approved, evaluatees shall<br/>select the plan (See List of Option II Plans). Feedback will be provided on all six Teaching Standards in<br/>the evaluation. The administrator will provide feedback in the “overall standard” column and<br/>substandard columns for those agreed upon focus standards. For all other standards the administrator<br/>will provide feedback only in the “overall standard” column and may also provide additional comments.</p>
<p>Option II format will consist of the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forty-five&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following the first day of school, the Permanent Unit</p>
<p>Member will meet with the site administrator to set goals and to establish an<br/>evaluation plan, based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession. The<br/>timeline may encompass one year or two years by mutual agreement of the Unit<br/>Member and the site administrator. If the evaluation encompasses two successive<br/>years and Teaching Standards are met, then the Unit Member will have at least a<br/>one-year interim prior to the next evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member’s evaluation deadline, the Unit Member shall</p>
<p>complete a Self-Evaluation Report describing the progress toward meeting<br/>established goals. Progress toward these goals shall be the primary basis for<br/>evaluation of the Unit Member.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each year that the plan encompasses, the Unit Member and administrator will<br/>complete the Evaluation Report, incorporating the Unit Member’s self-evaluation.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>Option II - Possible Evaluation Methods for Option II Plans</p>
<p>Shown below is a list of possible methods that may be used as part of developing a plan in Option</p>
<p>II. These methods may be used by Unit Members to demonstrate that the Unit Member has met<br/>Standards regarding the effective implementation of District curriculum, the utilization of instructional<br/>materials, student assessment practices and other important activities related to teaching. Upon<br/>completion of the evaluation in which the evaluatee has “met Standards,” the District shall return all media<br/>used in the evaluation to the evaluatee. Should the evaluatee receive “partially meet Standards” or “does<br/>not meet Standards,” media used in the evaluation shall be retained by the District until the evaluatee has<br/>met Standards, at which time the District shall return all media used in the evaluation to the evaluatee.<br/>Any media, which was created during the work time, and/or with District material, and is returned to the<br/>evaluatee, shall not subsequently be used by the evaluatee for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Videotape or audiotape: This method refers to the recording by the teacher of an actual classroom<br/>lesson video or audiotape. The focus could be on the teacher’s behavior or students’ reaction to<br/>classroom instruction. Such recordings are powerful in that they allow the teacher to see him/herself from<br/>the students’ perspective. The teacher’s review of the taped records can involve the use of some data<br/>collection or observation instrument. For example, the teacher could chart frequencies of specified<br/>behavior.</p>
<p>Self-ratina: A self-rating form requires the teacher to rank or grade him/herself on a variety of<br/>dimensions or behaviors specified on the form. Such a form would primarily be useful as a starting point<br/>for evaluation. Such a form, if developed by the participating teachers in a school, could provide a<br/>conceptual framework for the dimensions of excellent teaching.</p>
<p>Teacher journal: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journal of thoughts, reactions, progress, etc., focusing on a</p>
<p>particular student, class, or one’s teaching in general can be a valuable tool for self-reflection and<br/>professional growth. The focus of the journal entries should be decided in advance.</p>
<p>Self-study materials: This method involves using teacher training materials for reviewing one’s<br/>teaching style or to investigate alternative teaching techniques and materials.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Observation and modeling and reflection: The use of this method involves the observation by the<br/>teacher of examples of high quality teaching. Such observation, either in a class setting or on videotape,<br/>allows the teacher to compare his/her teaching with that of the expert. The observation may be structured,<br/>in that the teacher decides prior to the observation that he/she is looking at a specific dimension to<br/>teaching, or unstructured, in that the teacher may be open to what they may discover. Written reflection of<br/>the observation shared with the administrator will complete the process.</p>
<p>Teacher portfolios: Portfolios of lesson plans, teacher developed materials, student assessments<br/>used, or any other category of teaching products can be kept in a file and reviewed by the teacher as a<br/>way of constantly improving on what has been done or used. The purpose and criteria for including pieces<br/>in the portfolio can be maintained primarily for self reflection by the teacher. This reflection will be shared<br/>with the administrator.</p>
<p>Student and/or parent surveys: Administrator and Unit Member will agree upon the survey(s) to be<br/>used. Upon completion of the survey an action plan will be developed based on results. The action plan<br/>and results will be shared with the administrator.</p>
<p>Other methods and processes: The administrator and Unit Member will agree upon the method or<br/>project to be completed.</p>
