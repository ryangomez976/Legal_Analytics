<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Plan:</p>
<p>The purpose of evaluation is to improve instruction. Toward this end, site administration<br/>shall primarily assist unit members in meeting the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession (CSTP).</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;later than twenty-five (25) duty days following commencement of duties, the</p>
<p>unit member shall submit the Evaluation Plan (Appendix D) for the ensuing year.<br/>Within fifteen (15) duty days following the submission, the unit member and<br/>evaluator shall meet and agree on those Standards that shall be applied for<br/>evaluation purposes. The evaluation procedure shall be discussed in this meeting<br/>unless previously discussed individually or presented at a staff/faculty meeting.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of all non-permanent teachers shall follow the BTSA<br/>requirements by being evaluated on the first five (5) Standards and one (1)<br/>element of Standard Six (6).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every evaluation year: the evaluation of permanent unit members shall be<br/>based on three (3) of the Standards (one of which must be Standard 1, 3, or 4) and<br/>one element of Standard 6: Develops as a Professional Educator.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members may voluntarily agree to be evaluated on the first<br/>five (5) Standards and two (2) Elements of Standard Six (6): Develops as a<br/>Professional Educator. A list of unit members who volunteer under this Article<br/>shall be provided by October 31<sup>st</sup> of each year to the SAEA office. Should the<br/>SAEA President suspect irregularities in the voluntary nature of the process, the<br/>President of the Association or designee and the Associate Superintendent of the<br/>Human Resources or designee will meet within 5 days to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standards shall be specified in writing on the negotiated Evaluation Plan Form. In<br/>the event the written standards are not mutually agreed on, the designated evaluator may<br/>substitute up to two (2) Standards and/or one (1) Standard for each “unsatisfactory”<br/>received in the preceding evaluation. A Standard is identified as “unsatisfactory” if it has<br/>three (3) or more elements marked “Below Standard”.</p>
<p>A. Within five (5) duty days following determination of the Standards for the<br/>teaching profession, the unit member may submit to the designated evaluator<br/>written constraints which the unit member believes shall prevent him/her from<br/>attaining the Standards.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If agreement is not reached regarding Standards, the unit member may appeal<br/>to the Associate Superintendent, Human Resources, or designee, who shall make<br/>the final decision.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All non-permanent unit members shall be formally evaluated in writing no<br/>more than twice annually.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members with a satisfactory evaluation the preceding year,<br/>including ROP teachers and categorically funded unit members who have been<br/>employed in the district at least three (3) consecutive preceding years, shall be<br/>evaluated every other school year except per Ed. Code 44664.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members with at least ten (10) years of District service who<br/>meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are highly qualified (pursuant to ESEA/NCLB);</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the 5.1.1 meeting, voluntarily choose to be evaluated on the first<br/>five (5) Standards for the Teaching Profession plus two (2) elements of<br/>Standard 6: Develops as a Professional Educator;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voluntarily choose to have an unscheduled classroom evaluation;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meets standards in all areas;</p>
<p>shall be evaluated every five (5) years, per Ed. Code 44664. The unit member or<br/>evaluator shall be permitted to rescind this voluntary agreement and return to the<br/>evaluation process outlined in CBA Articles 5.1.1 through 5.1.2-D prior to<br/>November 30<sup>th</sup> of that school year.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member transfers or changes assignments during the five (5) year<br/>period, a new agreement shall be signed, if mutual agreement continues.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by any party, nor anything construed,<br/>regarding teachers who do or do not volunteer under this section or 5.1.1-C.</p>
<p>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit member being evaluated and the evaluator shall select observation times,</p>
<p>dates, conferences, and final evaluation dates.</p>
<p>A. During the course of the evaluation period circumstances may change which<br/>require modification of the original schedule. The unit member and designated<br/>evaluator shall agree in writing upon a revised schedule.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member may request a change of designated evaluator in writing<br/>including reasons for the request. If the designated evaluator denies the request,<br/>the unit member may appeal to the Associate Superintendent, Human Resources,<br/>or designee.

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No administratively-called meetings shall take place either voluntarily or<br/>involuntarily on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be responsible for meeting all duties (as defined in<br/>this Article), whether required by the site administration or the State of<br/>California, relevant to their assignments. The unit member's flexible duty<br/>day shall be completed when their responsibilities have been met.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary and Intermediate schools shall have one modified day per<br/>week which shall be used for staff/faculty meetings, department meetings,<br/>grade level meetings, collaboration, professional learning communities,<br/>staff development activities, in-services, and curriculum meetings.

<p>The flexible duty day will be adjusted when night or weekend activities require<br/>attendance, or when tasks assignments substantially extend the work day and/or<br/>work week. Back to School, Open House, and other school-wide parent-teacher<br/>meetings (other than PTAs and PTOs) are included in these activities. Alternative<br/>flexible duty day schedules may be made by unit members at the affected sites.</p>

Site is defined as: assigned location where tasks require work<br/>to be performed. With site administrator approval and when students are not<br/>present on site, task-oriented unit members may complete their responsibilities at<br/>a location other than their site(s) if they have the necessary materials and<br/>equipment to enable them to do so. Examples: computers, Internet connections,<br/>software, telephones, access to student lists, and specific information.</p>

<p>A. Unless otherwise directed or approved, on in-service, staff development,<br/>or other duty days when assigned students are not in attendance, unit<br/>members shall be expected to report to their work assignment or their<br/>assigned location no later than they would report if regular classes were in<br/>session with assigned students.</p>

<p>Meetings/Activities</p>
<p>Reasonableness shall prevail in calling required meetings and extending meetings<br/>(including Department meetings) beyond one hour after the end of the<br/>instructional day for the majority unit members on that site. Whenever possible,<br/>reasonable efforts will be made to end meetings and activities involving unit<br/>members before dark.</p>
<p>An extended meeting/activity is one which extends beyond the ending of the<br/>flexible duty day prescribed for the large majority of unit members on that site.</p>
<p>The following would not be considered applicable to provisions under 8.3.1</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings or activities for which remuneration is being paid for the general<br/>responsibilities (i.e. coaching, department chair meetings, band and choral<br/>activities).</p>

<p>Stipends and other compensation based on the Teacher Salary Schedule shall be<br/>computed on the schedule without the professional development days included,<br/>which is equal to a 1.2% reduction. The District shall make a “stipend calculation<br/>salary schedule” available to unit members. Stipend calculations will remain the<br/>same as calculated in 2010-2011.</p>
<p>For the 2011-2012 school year: one-half (.5) professional development day shall<br/>occur on Thursday, August 18, 2011; one (1) professional development day shall<br/>occur on Friday, August 19, 2011; and one (1) professional development day shall<br/>occur on Monday, August 22, 2011.

<p>Average class size shall be determined on a building site basis and shall be per teacher of</p>
<p>record as follows:</p>
<p>The District will make a good faith effort to provide class sizes in grades one and<br/>two that are below the average class size as stated in A below:</p>
<table border="1">

<p>---------- 25.0 students</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>An analysis of average class size by school shall be made no later than the end of the<br/>third week of school to identify schools exceeding the average class size.</p>
<p>Class sizes for grades K-3 shall not exceed the limitations of Education Code<br/>Sections 41376 and 41378 (kindergarten = 31; grades 1 - 3 = 30). If a class is<br/>over the cap, the District will correct this as soon as possible but in no event shall<br/>the time for the correction exceed three (3) weeks</p>
<p>Individual class size may vary from the building site average due to such things as the<br/>following factors:</p>
<p>Special Program Funding Requirements</p>
<p>High Transiency Rates</p>

<p>9.5.2</p>
<p>If the average class size increases to (or exceeds) the following, additional staffing unit(s)<br/>(equivalent of one teacher) shall be provided to be used for direct classroom assistance.<br/>The unit members affected shall be given the opportunity to make recommendations<br/>concerning the utilization of the additional staffing unit(s).</p>
<p>Elementary........................................... 32.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students</p>

<p>High School......................................... 33.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students</p>
<p>Opportunity/Continuation--------------------------- 26.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students</p>
<p>If any individual academic class enrollment exceeds the figures above by three</p>
<p>(3), and fifty percent (50%) or more of the students are EL students, serious<br/>consideration for additional assistance to the teacher will be given.</p>
<p>P.E. Classes</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of safety and upon the written request of the unit member,<br/>the District will provide relief to a P.E. class in the intermediate and/or<br/>high school if, after the first three (3) weeks of a semester, the verified<br/>attendance of the class exceeds fifty-five (55) for a period of two weeks or<br/>more.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relief shall take the form of one or more of the following: creation of<br/>an additional class, reduction of class size through student program<br/>changes, or provision of aide assistance to the class.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of relief may be used in lieu of the above with mutual<br/>agreement of the unit member and the site administrator.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever actual class size within a given period is adjusted by P.E.<br/>teachers themselves, depending on the type of physical activity taught by<br/>each teacher, then these provisions shall not apply.</p>
<p>The following shall not be utilized in determining average class size:</p>
<p>Special Education teachers and their students (Special Day Classes)</p>

<p>If non-bilingual class sizes are above that stipulated in 9.1.1 above, the District shall<br/>make a good faith effort to provide help for those classes if the increase was caused by<br/>small bilingual classes in that grade level in that school.</p>
<p>Staffing ratios for Special Education classes and teachers will not exceed the legal<br/>maximums.</p>
<p>If classes at Mitchell Child Development Center and/or Taft Hearing Impaired<br/>Program are taught by split sessions, the total number of students shall be the total<br/>in both sessions and shall be considered as one class. (Example: 16 students total:<br/>8 students served in early session and 8 students served in late session.)</p>
<p>The District shall establish a class size problem resolution committee at each level<br/>(elementary, intermediate, and high school) to study and suggest methods of relief in<br/>buildings to reduce split-grade classes, to reduce the impact of low enrollment classes, to<br/>allow for large group or experimental instruction, and/or team teaching.</p>
<p>Relief may take the form of one or more of the following:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation of an additional class</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce class size through student program changes</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide aide assistance to the class</p>

<p>10.0 ABSENCES/LEAVES</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>An “absence” is an authorization for a unit member to be absent from duty for a<br/>period of time not to exceed twenty (20) duty days (Exception: illness absence<br/>and maternity absence - see appropriate section.)</p>
<p>“Leaves” are those absences extending for a period of 21 duty days or more.</p>
<p>“Illness absence” means illness, injury, or physical disability or quarantine of the<br/>unit member.</p>
<p>Members of the immediate family means the mother, father, foster parents, legal<br/>guardians, grandmother, grandfather, grandchildren or great-grandchildren of the<br/>unit member or of the spouse of the unit member, and the spouse, son, son-in-law,<br/>daughter, daughter-in-law, brother or sister of the unit member, and brothers and<br/>sisters of the unit member’s spouse, or any relative permanently living in the<br/>immediate household of the unit member, only surviving blood relative, domestic<br/>partner.</p>
<p>Absences</p>
<p>General Provisions:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is absent from work other than for those days as<br/>authorized by State law or provisions of this Agreement is taking an<br/>unauthorized absence in breech of contract and in violation of the<br/>Agreement. Such unauthorized absence is subject to disciplinary action<br/>including dismissal.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence requests shall be made prior to the absence unless circumstances<br/>preclude the procedure.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>10.2.2</p>
<p>Maternity</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees covered by this Agreement shall be entitled to use personal<br/>illness leave (sick leave) as set forth in this Agreement for disabilities<br/>caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and<br/>recovery there from on the same terms and conditions governing leave of<br/>absence for other illnesses, injuries, or medical disabilities. Such leave<br/>shall not be used for child care, child rearing, or preparation for<br/>childbearing, but shall be limited to those disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery there<br/>from.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is pregnant may continue in active employment as late<br/>into her pregnancy as she desires, provided she is able to perform her<br/>required duties and responsibilities and has submitted the necessary<br/>doctor’s certificate.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of such pregnancy disability leave, including the date on which<br/>the employee’s duties with the District are to be resumed, shall be<br/>determined by the employee and the employee’s physician.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall be entitled to leave without pay or other benefits for<br/>disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth,<br/>or recovery there from, when all current, accumulated and differential sick<br/>leave has been exhausted. The date on which the employee shall resume<br/>duties shall be determined by the employee on leave and the employee’s<br/>physician, provided, however, that the District management may require a<br/>verification of the extent of disability.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leave policy shall be construed as requiring the Board of Education to<br/>grant leave with pay only when it is necessary to do so in order that leaves<br/>of absence for disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, or childbirth are treated the same as leaves for other illnesses,<br/>injuries, or disabilities.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on pregnancy disability leave for one semester or less shall<br/>be entitled to return to the same assignment held at the time such leave<br/>commenced, unless such assignment has been discontinued, in which case<br/>the employee shall be entitled to a comparable assignment. An employee<br/>on pregnancy disability leave for more than one semester shall be entitled<br/>to return to an assignment comparable to the assignment held at the time<br/>such leave commenced. In any case, the assignment of the employee upon<br/>return to work shall be comparable to that held at the time pregnancy<br/>disability began. “Comparable” means same educational level (primary,<br/>upper elementary, middle school, or secondary) and also means immediate<br/>assignment within major and/or minor teaching fields whenever possible,<br/>except by request of the employee and subject to availability of the<br/>position.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the District determines that it may be appropriate to require<br/>verification of the extent of any of the disabilities referred to above, said<br/>verification shall be achieved through one of the following two (2)<br/>methods - the option to be exercised by the affected employee, in the<br/>event the employee does not exercise an option upon request, the District<br/>may proceed with procedure 1 below:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District management may require a verification of the extent of<br/>disability through a physical examination of an employee by a<br/>physician appointed by the District, at District expense, or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional medical examination shall be conducted by the<br/>employee’s physician at District expense. In the event the employee<br/>chooses to exercise that option, the employee’s physician verification<br/>shall contain the following language:</p>
<p>I understand that my verification of disability is to be used for the<br/>expenditure of public funds. I have read the foregoing verification of<br/>disability and declare under penalty of perjury that it is true and<br/>correct.</p>
<p>Executed this_day &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of_,</p>
<p>20_at_, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California,_</p>
<p>County.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use fifteen (15) days of accumulated sick days for the<br/>birth or adoption of a child. (Does not apply to the mother in natural birth.)</p>
<p>52</p>

<p>14.0 DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>Just Cause Discipline: The District retains the sole right to discipline unit members for<br/>just cause, applying principles of due process.</p>
<p>Notice: In order to be timely filed, a charge shall be initiated no later the twenty-five (25)<br/>duty days following the act or occurrence upon which the charges are based or twenty-<br/>five (25) days following the date the District reasonably should have known of the act or<br/>occurrence.</p>
<p>Prior Events: In imposing discipline, the District shall not take into account any prior<br/>charges which occurred more than four (4) years preceding the date of the charge or<br/>charges giving rise to the discipline.</p>
<p>Progressive Discipline: The corrective process of applying penalties short of discharge<br/>where conduct is of a less serious nature and the employee has not repeatedly engaged in<br/>such conduct. The nature of such discipline should be appropriate to the conduct and<br/>need not begin with the least serious disciplinary action. The basic steps in progressive<br/>discipline are listed below:</p>
<p>Verbal reprimand(s): The supervising administrator shall clarify that “this is a<br/>verbal reprimand,” and cite the reason for the reprimand.</p>
<p>Conference with written memorandum of summary, including appropriate steps<br/>for corrective action.</p>
<p>Written reprimand (in personnel file).</p>
<p>Suspension(s) with or without pay of up to 15 days.</p>
<p>It is understood that some occurrences leading to discipline under this provision<br/>may be of such seriousness as to not require strict adherence to each of the steps<br/>set forth above.</p>
<p>If a supervisor recommends disciplinary action, the unit member has the right to appeal<br/>the recommended action to the Superintendent through the Associate Superintendent,<br/>Human Resource by filing a written request within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of<br/>such a recommendation. The supervisor or his/her designee may grant an additional five</p>
<p>(5) days to file the request to appeal. Failure to file such a written appeal within the<br/>stated time shall waive the right of appeal.</p>
<p>Grievability: Sections 14.4.1 to 14.4.3 shall be grievable only to the extent that the steps<br/>set forth were appropriately adhered to. The substance of statements made under 14.4.1<br/>to 14.4.3 shall not be grievable.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>14.7 For purposes of this Article, discipline shall not be defined to include termination,<br/>suspension pursuant to Education Code Sections 44939 and 44940, or non-reelection<br/>pursuant to California Education Code Section 44882, nor does this Article in any way<br/>limit the District’s right to initiate such procedures.</p>

The analysis shall reflect renewal<br/>rates/expected costs/savings based on a composite percentage increase/decrease per<br/>enrollee multiplied by the number of enrollees in the plan at the time of the actuarial<br/>analysis using current plan designs. Proposed provider increases/decreases shall be<br/>presented to the Health Benefits Authority on or before seventy-five (75) calendar days<br/>prior to the end of the health benefits plan year (i.e. April 15<sup>th</sup> of a fiscal health benefits<br/>plan year).</p>

If those excess funds exceed the value of two (2)<br/>months of health benefits costs, then those excess funds over the value of the two</p>
<p>(2) months shall be made available for health benefits related negotiations.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District’s existing health benefits plan year’s per enrollee premium/costs<br/>level does not cover the proposed increase in premium/costs, the Health Benefits<br/>Authority shall, prior to open enrollment, take action to implement or</p>
<p>change one or more of the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan modifications</p>

<p>A. Consensus Decision Making Model</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consensus building regarding the annual actuarial analysis and<br/>implementation of needed changes shall be used.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following consensus building, a vote shall be taken to<br/>implement the recommended changes. District and<br/>Labor shall have an equal one (1) District to one (1)</p>

<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cooperative relationship between the consulting teacher and the<br/>principal shall be expected and strongly encouraged by the Association<br/>and the District. The designated evaluator shall retain the responsibility<br/>for the evaluation.</p>
<p>Related Matters</p>
<p>A. Peer Assistance and Review Budget</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peer Review Panel shall develop and recommend a budget to the<br/>Governing Board through the Superintendent or through the regular<br/>budget development process.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article shall be in compliance with the Education Code<br/>requirements covering Peer Assistance and Review Programs.</p>
<p>Joint Committee</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Santa Ana Educators’ Association (SAEA) and the Santa Ana Unified<br/>School District (SAUSD) shall through a committee comprised of four (4)<br/>members appointed by SAEA and four (4) members appointed by<br/>SAUSD:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop new teacher training and support programs pursuant to<br/>Education Code section 44506 (c)(5). (Assembly Bill No. lx. First<br/>Extraordinary Session, 1999).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop professional development for all teachers pursuant to<br/>Education Code section 44506(c)(4). (Assembly Bill No. lx. First<br/>Extraordinary Session, 1999).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAEA and the District shall also jointly develop a budget annually<br/>utilizing the AB IX funding not budgeted for the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Program, to develop and implement new teacher training and<br/>support programs and staff development for all teachers.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such programs and budget shall be recommended to the Governing Board<br/>for consideration and adoption pursuant to its annual budgeting process.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>20.1.7</p>
<p>D. SAEA appointees shall receive $200 for each meeting attended. Meetings<br/>shall occur outside the normal duty day. The parties agree to evaluate this<br/>process and pay arrangement on an annual basis and make adjustments<br/>accordingly, to meet the needs of the PAR program and joint committee<br/>members.</p>
<p>Peer Assistance and Review Implementation</p>
<p>The Peer Assistance and Review Program, as a replacement for the<br/>Mentor Teacher Program and as found in the negotiated agreement<br/>between the District and the Association, is intended to provide peer<br/>assistance to tenured participating teachers who are referred for<br/>unsatisfactory performance or who have volunteered. The Consulting<br/>teacher’s role shall not replace or in any way erode the responsibility of<br/>the principal or assistant principal as evaluators as described in the Stull<br/>Act. The statute does not permit the Consulting Teacher or the PAR Panel<br/>to evaluate the Participating Teacher. Under the statute the District<br/>maintains the responsibility to evaluate teachers. This remains the role of<br/>the principal/assistant principal as evaluators.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective October 1, for courses with six or more sections per school<br/>(excluding Performing Arts and P.E.), teachers who have classes with more<br/>than 40 students on the roster for 10 consecutive school days, will be<br/>compensated at the rate of $10 per student per day, for a maximum of $40<br/>per day.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties will work diligently to reduce the class size in the District, with<br/>an ultimate long-term goal of 36. In order to accomplish this, the parties<br/>agree that in the event the District receives an increase of 2% or more in its<br/>funded base revenue limit for two consecutive years, the current agreed<br/>upon cap of 40 will be reduced by one, to 39. The parties intend to review<br/>after the first adjustment whether to continue this formulation for reducing<br/>class size.</p>
<p>5. The parties will form a joint Committee of 4 members (2 from SAEA and 2<br/>from SAUSD) to assess the data, address issues and concerns, and jointly<br/>solve problems arising from this Agreement. The joint Committee will meet<br/>on a monthly basis for the 2009-2010 school year, and as needed thereafter.</p>

<p>6. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve their issues regarding the<br/>implementation of this Agreement, either party may request the assistance of<br/>the Mediator/Arbitrator.</p>
<p>7. This Agreement is subject to approval by the parties' respective Boards. If<br/>either party rejects the Agreement, the parties will resume the<br/>mediation/arbitration process.</p>
