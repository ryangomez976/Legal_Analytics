<p>It is understood and agreed that the District retains all of its powers and authority to direct,<br/>manage, and control to the full extent of the law, limited only by the specific and express<br/>terms of this Agreement and then only to the extent such specific and express terms are in<br/>conformance with law.</p>

<p>Neither party shall discriminate against an employee in the<br/>exercise of these alternative rights.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, membership in the Association shall not be<br/>compulsory. A unit member has the right to choose, either: to<br/>become a member of the Association; or, to pay to the<br/>Association a fee for representation services; or, to refrain from<br/>either of the above courses of action upon the grounds set forth in<br/>Section 5.2.6 below.</p>

<p>The fee is paid in exchange for representation services necessarily</p>
<p>-5-</p>
<p>performed by the Association in conformance with its legally imposed<br/>duty of fair representation on behalf of said unit member who is not a<br/>member of the Association.</p>
<p>5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of Representation Fee</p>
<p>The representation fee collected from non-Association unit members<br/>pursuant to Section 5.2.2 above shall be determined by the Association<br/>in accordance with California law.</p>
<p>5.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions</p>
<p>(a) Exceptions to Section 5.2.3 shall be as follows;</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time, non-exempt bargaining unit members hired during<br/>the school year shall pay a pro-rated representation fee. Such<br/>pro-rata share shall be based upon the number of days of<br/>actual scheduled service for a school year as compared with<br/>the number of days available for full-time employment in the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time, non-exempt bargaining unit members shall pay a<br/>pro-rated representation fee on the basis of said employee's<br/>annual salary as compared with the same annual salary for a<br/>comparable full-time employee.</p>
<p>5.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Verification of Representation Fee by Association</p>
<p>(a) At least thirty (30) days prior to the collection of a representation<br/>fee in accordance with Section 5.2.3 from any unit member<br/>pursuant to these provisions, the Association shall submit a<br/>written statement of such fee. Each year such amount shall be<br/>submitted in writing to the District by the Association within ninety<br/>(90) days of July 1.</p>
<p>5.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees Exempted From Obligation to Pay Association</p>
<p>(a) Any unit member shall be exempted from the requirements of<br/>Section5.2.2 above, if such employee has a bona fide religious<br/>objection to the payment of any fee in support of a union or<br/>&quot;employee organization&quot; as defined in Section 3540.1(d) of the<br/>Government Code.</p>
<p>-6-</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such exempt unit member shall, as an alternative to payment of<br/>a representation fee to the Association, pay an amount<br/>equivalent to such representation fee to:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Cancer Society;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation to Assist California Teachers;</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way; or</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other qualified charity jointly agreed upon by the<br/>District and the Association.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, upon written request, may require such exempt unit<br/>member to submit a written affidavit to the Association within fifteen<br/>(15) work days verifying the existence and nature of the allowable<br/>objection to payment of a representation fee. In addition, the<br/>Association may require such exempt unit member to submit proof of<br/>payment of an amount equivalent to such representation fee to one of<br/>the alternative funds or organizations listed above.</p>
<p>5.2.7 Payment Method</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit members who are not exempted from payment under<br/>Section 5.2.6 above may pay annually the properly determined<br/>representation fee directly to the Association.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative to the direct payment method, a unit member may<br/>voluntarily sign and deliver to the District a written assignment<br/>authorizing deduction of the properly established representation fee<br/>as defined in Section 5.2.3 above, subject to the conditions set forth<br/>elsewhere in this Agreement for payroll deductions. Upon voluntary<br/>authorization duly completed and executed, the District will deduct<br/>from the pay of unit members and pay to the Association the normal<br/>and regular monthly representation fee.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member who is not exempted from payment<br/>under Section 5.2.6 does not voluntarily sign and deliver to the District<br/>an authorization pursuant to Section 5.2.7(b) or pay annually the<br/>representation fee directly to the Association pursuant to Section<br/>5.2.7(a), the Association may request in writing that the District deduct<br/>from the pay of the unit member and pay to the Association the<br/>normal and regular monthly representation fee without the approval of<br/>the unit member. Prior to making a request for the District to<br/>involuntarily deduct the representation fee from any unit member's<br/>pay, the Association shall notify the unit member of the request. If the<br/>unit member and the Association are unable to reach an agreement<br/>on the manner of payment, the District shall be obligated to make</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>such deductions as requested by the Association.</p>
<p>(d) Upon the rehiring of any unit member, or upon the recalling of a<br/>unit member from layoff status, the District will resume or initiate<br/>dues or representation fee deductions for such member only<br/>upon a valid dues/representation fee deduction authorization as<br/>defined herein.</p>

<p>The District's sole and exclusive obligations under this Article are to<br/>notify any unit member who has failed to comply with the provisions of this<br/>Article that, as a condition of employment in the District, such unit member<br/>must either become an Association member, pay a representation fee,<br/>either through voluntary or involuntary deductions, or establish an exempt<br/>status and make payment pursuant to provisions of Section 5.2.6 of this<br/>Agreement, and to make payroll deductions pursuant to Section 5.2.7 of this<br/>Agreement. Under no circumstances shall the District be required to dismiss<br/>any unit member for failure to fulfill his/her obligations to pay the fees<br/>established herein.</p>
<p>5.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold Harmless Provision</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided the District makes a written demand within sixty (60) days of<br/>incurring any legal fees or costs, the California Teachers Association<br/>agrees to pay the District all legal fees and legal costs incurred in<br/>defending against any court action and/or administration action before<br/>the Public Employment Relations Board challenging the legality, the<br/>constitutionality the Agency Fee provision of this Agreement or its<br/>implementation.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the District makes a demand for reimbursement as<br/>provided above, the California Teachers Association shall have the<br/>exclusive right to decide and determine whether any such action or<br/>proceeding for which it is reimbursing the District for legal fees and<br/>costs shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, tried or<br/>appealed.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT/JOB SHARE</p>
<p>It is the intent of this provision to allow part-time certificated employment in instances<br/>where it is mutually beneficial to the employee and the District. District initiated part-time<br/>employment as well as employee initiated part-time employment are addressed by this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>Part-Time</p>
<p>An employee's request shall be submitted annually in writing by January 15th. An<br/>employee who requested and was granted a part-time assignment who wishes to return to<br/>a full-time assignment for the following school year shall notify the District in writing by<br/>March 1st. The District shall approve or deny the requests in writing by March 1st of the<br/>current school year.</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be by mutual consent of the District and the Association to determine:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which employees will participate.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many employees will participate.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of the part-time employment.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to any Board action on the leave of an individual pursuant to<br/>these provisions, the District shall provide a copy of these<br/>provisions to the individual, and shall notify the Association of the<br/>intended action within sufficient time to counsel the employee of the<br/>rights hereunder.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District's commitment to individual employees for part-time employment<br/>extends for the current school year only and must be renewed annually at the<br/>District's discretion. However, once the pro-rata time has been established,<br/>such percentage will be guaranteed for the current school year. If the part-<br/>time employment is not renewed by the District, the teacher shall be given<br/>opportunity for r eturn to full-time employment.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work load, work hours and days of employment shall be mutually<br/>established prior to the part-time employment commencement.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will determine on an annual basis whether the employee is to<br/>continue at the part-time employment level subject to the approval of the<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>-12-</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be paid a salary which is a pro-rata share of the salary<br/>which would have been earned on a full-time basis.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of part-time certificated employment only, a full-time teaching day<br/>will be considered 7-1/2 hours per day, for one hundred eighty-five (185) days.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On campus, before and after duty time, preparation time, and non-compensated<br/>extra duties are determined by the ratio of the teaching hours to the assignments of<br/>full-time teachers. Part-time certificated employees (.5 FTE or greater) must be in<br/>attendance at all faculty/in-service meetings in accordance with Article 6.5 of the<br/>current contract. Compensation will be determined by the number of hours about<br/>their FTE. Exceptions may be made by mutual agreement of employee and<br/>the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time members are entitled to receive District paid insurance benefits on a<br/>pro- rata basis. Employees who work less than full-time may apply the District's<br/>portion of health, vision, dental or life to one or all of these options.</p>
<p>7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee and the District will participate in the State Teachers<br/>Retirement System in accordance with the rules established by the State<br/>Teachers Retirement Fund for half-time work with full credit being given.</p>
<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee will maintain seniority in accordance with Education<br/>Code provisions, with the date of hire being established as the first date of actual<br/>service. The employee shall be eligible for a salary increment step if .he/she<br/>is in active employment in his/her position for fifty percent (50%) of the normal<br/>work year.</p>
<p>7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment must be initially exercised at the written request<br/>of the employee. Thereafter, continued part-time certificated employment will be<br/>determined by the conditions outlined in this agreement.</p>
<p>7.12 The amount of sick leave earned varies directly to the percent of full-time<br/>employment. An employee who must use sick leave will reduce earned sick<br/>leave on the same pro-rata basis as his/her employment.</p>
<p>7 13 All applicable Education Code sections and State Teachers Retirement<br/>System provisions will apply to this agreement.</p>
<p>J.Qb Shgrjng</p>
<p>7.14.1 A sharing of a job may be proposed by any regular teaching District<br/>certificated employee. Job sharing shall refer to two (2) unit members on<br/>District contracts sharing one (1) teaching assignment. If a certificated</p>
<p>District employee has interest in job sharing, a written application and<br/>proposal must be made to the District by March 30th. Two unit members may<br/>share an assignment for a minimum of one (1) year. The District has no<br/>obligation whatsoever under these provisions to search for, locate, or assign<br/>a District certificated employee to share an assignment.</p>

<p>The District shall approve or deny requests and notify,<br/>in writing, the applicant of its decision by the first<br/>regularly scheduled board meeting in May. If a<br/>request is denied, the applicant shall be notified, in<br/>writing, of the specific reasons for the denial. The<br/>decision to approve or disapprove a job sharing<br/>application is discretionary and shall not be subject to<br/>the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>7.14.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no other certificated District employee wants to job<br/>share, the applicant and District, working together, may<br/>generate a job share position.

<p>12.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level 2</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee shall meet with the<br/>aggrieved party and/or designated Association representative<br/>within five (5) days of receipt of the grievance appeal and shall<br/>provide a written disposition of the grievance, including the<br/>reasons therefore, to all parties of interest within two (2) days<br/>of such meeting.</p>

<p>12.4 Time Limits</p>
<p>12.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day following<br/>receipt of the grievance, grievance appeal or written decision.</p>
<p>12.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as<br/>possible, the time limits specified at each level should be<br/>considered to be maximums and every effort should be made to<br/>expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be extended by<br/>mutual agreement.</p>
<p>12.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be<br/>processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the<br/>end of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of<br/>the following school year, could result in harm to an aggrieved<br/>person, the time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the<br/>procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as<br/>soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>12.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Board does not act within fourteen (14) calendar days from<br/>the receipt of the arbitrator's recommendation, it will become final.</p>

<p>Upon mutual agreement of the Association and the<br/>Superintendent, a grievance may be taken directly to advisory<br/>arbitration.</p>
<p>A unit member may at any time present grievances to the employer,<br/>and have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the<br/>Association, as long as the adjustment is reached prior to<br/>arbitration and such adjustment is not inconsistent with terms of the<br/>written Agreement. If an employee presents a grievance on his/her<br/>own behalf, the Association shall have the right to be present and<br/>state its views at all grievance meetings. The District shall not<br/>agree to a resolution of the grievance until the Association has<br/>received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution<br/>and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 17<br/>PEER ASSISTANCE AND PEER REVIEW</p>
<p>17.1 Purpose<br/>17.1.1</p>
<p>17.1.2</p>
<p>17.1.3</p>
<p>17.1.4</p>
<p>Junction Teachers Association and Junction School District are<br/>continuously striving to provide the highest possible quality of<br/>education. In order for students to succeed in learning, teachers<br/>must succeed in teaching. Therefore, the parties agree to<br/>cooperate in the design and implementation of programs to<br/>improve the quality of instruction through expanded and improved<br/>professional development and peer assistance. Teachers referred<br/>to or who volunteer for the program are viewed as valuable<br/>professionals who deserve to have the best resources available<br/>provided to them in the interest of improving performance to a<br/>successful standard.</p>
<p>The Peer Assistance Review Program allows exemplary teachers to<br/>assist certain permanent and beginning teachers in the areas of<br/>subject matter knowledge, teaching strategies, and teaching<br/>methods.</p>
<p>The extent of the program’s assistance and review depends on<br/>whether the participating teacher is a beginning teacher, a volunteer<br/>permanent teacher or a permanent teacher who has received an<br/>overall unsatisfactory evaluation in the areas of teaching methods<br/>and instruction. The program’s assistance shall be provided<br/>through consulting teachers as described in detail in Section 17.5.<br/>This assistance shall not involve the participation in, nor the<br/>conducting of, the annual evaluation of certificated personnel except<br/>for making available to the evaluator the results of some unit<br/>members’ participation in the program.</p>
<p>The program resources shall be utilized in the following priority:<br/>first, for participating teachers with an unsatisfactory evaluation;<br/>second, for beginning teachers; and finally, for volunteer<br/>participating teachers.</p>

<p>17.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A volunteer participating teacher is a teacher with permanent<br/>status who volunteers to participate in the PAR Program. The<br/>purpose of participation in the PAR Program for the volunteer<br/>participating teacher is for peer assistance only and/or as an<br/>alternative evaluation vehicle (Article 14.8). The volunteer<br/>participating teacher may terminate his or her participation in the PAR<br/>Program at any time pending ratification of the joint committee.</p>
<p>17.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consulting teacher is a teacher who provides assistance to a<br/>participating teacher pursuant to the PAR Program.</p>
<p>17.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beginning teacher is any certificated member having probationary<br/>status, or a District teaching intern participating in a program<br/>established according to Education Code Sections 44305, et seq.<br/>and 44325, et seq. This peer program is to be closely<br/>coordinated with other District programs for training and<br/>assistance to beginning teachers.</p>
<p>17.3 Joint Committee</p>
<p>17.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee shall consist of three (3) members, the majority</p>
