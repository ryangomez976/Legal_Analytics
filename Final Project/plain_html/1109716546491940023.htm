<p>In 2015/16, if the unrestricted General Fund state revenues increase by more than<br/>$750,000 from the 2014/15 fiscal year, the District shall fund a salary bonus of up to</p>
<p>1.5% for all TTA unit members, commensurate with the amount of revenue in excess<br/>of $750,000. This salary bonus shall be for the 2015/16 year only. (Example: if the<br/>cost of a 1% salary increase in $100,000, and $100,000 in revenues above $750,000<br/>come to the District, all employees would receive a 1% off-schedule bonus.)</p>

The employee shall,<br/>after the meeting with the evaluator, develop a proposal which is designed to<br/>alleviate any unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator may provide, or the employee may request, further continued<br/>periodic observations and conferences.</p>

<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon return from a leave of absence of one (1) calendar year or less, the unit member<br/>will be returned to the position held prior to the leave. In any event, employees will be<br/>assigned within the scope of their credential. Whenever possible, the exact date of<br/>return shall be specified in the leave request. Teachers are encouraged to time their<br/>return to work with the beginning of a grading period.</p>
<p>Family Medical Leave</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide family and medical leave in compliance with the Family and<br/>Medical Leave Act and the parallel California leave of absence statute (Government<br/>Code § 12945.2). In meeting such statutory obligations, the District will, to the<br/>maximum extent permitted by law, credit any paid or unpaid leave status otherwise<br/>granted by this Agreement toward said statutory obligations. Thus, the statutory leave<br/>will run concurrently with the leave(s) granted pursuant to the other sections of this<br/>Article. At the discretion of the Superintendent, such leave may be allowed after<br/>exhaustion of all other available leaves.</p>
<p>Such statutory family and medical leave status includes up to twelve (12) weeks per<br/>year (referring to the twelve (12) month period beginning on the date any family and<br/>medical leave commences) as unpaid leave of absence, due to childbirth, or adoption,<br/>commencement of foster care, or infant care of the employee’s child, or the serious<br/>illness or health condition of the employee, the employee's spouse, the employee’s<br/>child or the employee’s parents. Leave taken for any of these reasons will be counted<br/>against the employee’s annual family and medical leave entitlements. However, the<br/>State-required leave of absence due to employee disability caused by pregnancy,<br/>childbirth and related conditions is not credited against the twelve (12) weeks of leave.<br/>Leave taken to care for a newborn or foster or adopted child must be completed within<br/>one (1) year of the birth or placement. Also, in these circumstances, if both spouses<br/>are employed by the District, the combined total Family Care and Medical Leave shall<br/>be limited to twelve (12) weeks,</p>
<p>An employee may substitute accrued vacation or other paid leave in place of his or her<br/>family medical leave entitlement. The District may require the employee to substitute</p>
<p>T.T.A. Agreement-2013/2016<br/>Approved: 1/9/14</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>accrued vacation or other paid leave, including sick leave where applicable, for the<br/>unpaid family medical leave entitlement.</p>
<p>For purposes of this section only, the references to “child&quot; in Article XI.P.2 above<br/>includes a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or other person<br/>under 18, or an adult dependent child (one who is incapable of self-care because of<br/>mental or physical disability) for whom the employee has primary care giving<br/>responsibility, and the reference to &quot;parent&quot; includes biological, foster or adoptive<br/>parent or any other person who had primary care giving responsibility for the<br/>employee when the employee was a child.</p>
<p>The employee must have been employed by the District at least one full year (and<br/>provided at least 1,250 hours of service over the previous twelve (12) months)<br/>immediately prior to such leave in order to qualify for the leave. Part-time employees<br/>must have been employed by the District at least one full year (and have provided at<br/>least 937.5 hours of service over the previous twelve (12) months) immediately prior to<br/>such leave in order to qualify for the leave.</p>
<p>The employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule any such absence or related<br/>medical treatment so as to avoid disruption of District operations, and shall give the<br/>District at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice of such leave plans. If the<br/>need for leave is unforeseen, written notice must be given as soon as possible.<br/>Failure to provide timely notice may result in postponement of the Family Care and<br/>Medical Leave.</p>
<p>The District may require written certification to be issued by the health care provider of<br/>the person with the serious health condition, including certifications of the date on<br/>which the condition commenced, the probable duration of the condition, an estimate of<br/>the amount of time the employee is needed to care for the individual, if the leave is<br/>due to the serious health condition of a child, spouse or parent, and a statement that<br/>the illness warrants the participation of the employee or renders the employee unable<br/>to perform his or her job functions. The District may also require medical certification<br/>of fitness to return to work if the employee is on family leave for his/her own serious<br/>health condition. Failure to produce any required certification shall result in denial of<br/>family and medical leave. If the District doubts the validity of the certification, it may<br/>require that the employee or other disabled person obtain a second opinion of a health<br/>care provider selected by the District, at District expense. If the two opinions conflict,<br/>the District may require a third opinion from a health care provider mutually agreed<br/>upon by the District and the employee. The third opinion shall be final and binding on<br/>the District and the employee. If the statutory leave is being granted concurrently with<br/>another leave under this Article, then the normal contract procedure shall prevail over<br/>the above special certification process.</p>
<p>To the extent required by applicable laws, employees returning from a family and<br/>medical leave shall be returned to the same position, or to a position comparable to<br/>the position, they occupied prior to their leave.</p>
<p>Subject to the above-mentioned &quot;credit&quot; provisions of Article XI.P.1 above, the<br/>employee during this leave shall be entitled to continued coverage under the health</p>
<p>T.T.A, Agreement - 2013/2016<br/>Approved: 1/9/14</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>insurance plan to the same extent, and subject to the same conditions, as an active<br/>employee.</p>
<p>If the employee fails to return upon expiration of the leave for a reason other than the<br/>continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would itself have<br/>met the qualifications for family and medical leave, then the District may recover<br/>health insurance premiums paid pursuant to the above leave provisions.</p>
<p>Any employee on leave who is under a health plan which requires co-payment must<br/>continue payments in a timely fashion in order to qualify for District coverage.</p>
<p>An employee may be required to provide periodic reports of his or her status and of<br/>his or her intent to return to work while on leave. Such reports may be required as<br/>often as every thirty (30) days, unless otherwise specified by the employee’s<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>M. The District may grant a leave of absence with pay to any employee, as a result of the<br/>catastrophic illness of the employee or a member of the immediate family. The<br/>employee must apply to the Superintendent for such leave, and the Superintendent<br/>shall determine eligibility for such leave. At the Superintendent’s discretion, a request<br/>for donations of sick leave may be made to all other employees of the District for credit<br/>to a bank of days for the employee facing a catastrophic illness. To the extent of such<br/>donations, the employee will then be granted paid leave for the duration of such<br/>catastrophic illness or until such donated leave is used, after the employee's own paid<br/>leaves are exhausted. The use of catastrophic leave donations is limited to the<br/>duration of such catastrophic illness.</p>

<p>53</p>
<p>APPENDIX D - EMPLOYEE JOB-SHARE AGREEMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the written request of two (2) full-time employees (“team&quot;), the District may agree<br/>to allow the employees to participate in a job-share arrangement. The request<br/>(Appendix C.1) must be made by March 15 of the school year preceding the school<br/>year in which the team desires to begin the job-share arrangement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member of the team must have achieved permanent status with the<br/>District, must meet all of the credential and job description requirements for the<br/>requested position, and must have a satisfactory or better overall rating on the<br/>latest evaluation of instructional performance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request must include a work schedule that is acceptable to the District.<br/>The proposed schedule shall be attached to the request.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a request to be acted upon by the Board of Trustees, the request<br/>must receive a positive recommendation from the principal of each team<br/>member, as well as from the superintendent. All proposals will be considered<br/>on a case-by-case basis. Decisions will be transmitted to requesting unit<br/>members, in written form. If denied, either of the requesting unit members may<br/>request the specific reasons for denial in writing.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Appendix, the total combined cost to<br/>the District for each job-share arrangement shall not exceed the cost of a full¬<br/>time position.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job-share responsibilities of each team member shall be agreed on by the team<br/>and the District prior to the commencement of duties.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each team member shall attend all required meetings, as well as fulfill all<br/>professional responsibilities normally assigned to a full-time employee. Unless<br/>excused from the responsibility by the District, each team member is required to<br/>attend Open House, Back-to-School Night, District curriculum in-service<br/>meetings, parent conferences, and staff meetings or conferences as assigned<br/>by the principal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the resignation or long-term absence of one team member, the<br/>other team member agrees to assume the duties of the position on a full-time<br/>basis for the period of the absence, unless excused from the responsibility by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary of each team member shall be based on the percentage of time assigned<br/>to the team member as compared to a full-time position, e.g., a team member<br/>assigned to work half-time shall receive one-half salary. For purposes of<br/>advancement on the certificated salary schedule based upon years of experience, the<br/>experience will be credited in relation to the amount of time served in the job-shared<br/>position, e.g., two (2) years served at one-half time equal one (1) full year of service<br/>for salary advancement.</p>
<p>T.T.A. Agreement-2013/2016</p>
<p>Approved: 1/9/14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s required contribution for the Health and Welfare Benefits package<br/>for each team member shall be pro-rated on the same basis as the team<br/>member’s salary. A job-share teacher is not required to maintain participation<br/>in the District’s Health &amp; Welfare Benefits programs, but may choose to<br/>participate, paying a pro-rata share through payroll deduction.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as set forth in paragraphs C and C.1, an employee who participates in a<br/>job-sharing arrangement shall retain employment status with the District on the<br/>basis of the employee's regular full-time position. Since job-share requests are<br/>essentially a voluntary reduction from full-time employment, a team member is<br/>not eligible for unemployment benefits for any time spent in a job-share<br/>position.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between February 1 and March 1 of each school year, a team may request that the<br/>District extend the current job-share arrangement for the following school year. The<br/>request must meet all of the criteria and requirements of paragraphs A.4 of this<br/>Appendix.</p>
<p>1. At the end of the job share, permanent teachers shall be returned to a full-time<br/>teaching position.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may terminate a job-share arrangement at any time on 30-day written<br/>notice to the team members. If the arrangement is terminated, each team member<br/>shall be reinstated to a full-time position for the remainder of the school year unless<br/>the team member requests and receives an unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary teachers (grades 7 through 12) who participate in a job share may<br/>voluntarily be assigned to teach additional classes. Compensation for such additional<br/>classes shall be pro-rated based on the teacher’s regular salary.</p>
<p>T.T.A. Agreement - 2013/2016<br/>Approved: 1/9/14</p>

<p>By their signatures below, the undersigned employees request that the District agree<br/>to a job-share arrangement for the next school year. Attached to this request is a proposed<br/>work schedule for each member of the job-share team.</p>
<p>Each member of the proposed team agrees to adhere to and abide by the terms of<br/>Appendix C, Employee Job-Share Agreement, contained in the current Templeton Unified<br/>School District/Templeton Teachers Association/California Teachers'Association/NEA<br/>collective bargaining agreement.</p>
