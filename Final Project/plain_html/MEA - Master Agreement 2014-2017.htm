<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial placement on the salary schedule shall be in accordance with approved<br/>and verified units (as outlined in Section 3b below) and accepted and verified<br/>prior experience up to and including a maximum of twenty-one (21) years<br/>effective July 1, 2006. Each school year, the unit member shall be advanced<br/>on the appropriate step in accordance with District-approved teaching<br/>experience. A unit member whose contracted salary reflects seventy-five<br/>percent (75%) or more of the amount specified on his/her assigned step and<br/>class on the District's salary schedule shall advance one (1) full step the next<br/>year on the salary schedule. Any unit member who is hired without a<br/>preliminary credential will be placed at A-l on the adopted salary schedule and<br/>will remain at that step until a preliminary credential is obtained. When the<br/>unit member provides the District with documentation showing that a<br/>preliminary credential has been obtained, the employee’s salary placement will<br/>be revised to give full credit for accepted years of experience and units of<br/>professional growth. The unit member’s compensation for this new placement<br/>will not be retroactive.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Umt members serving the initial year of employment in the District or unit<br/>members on first, official, unpaid leaves of absence whose contracts reflect<br/>more than fifty percent (50%) of the amount specified on his/her assigned</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>class and step on the District's salary schedule shall advance one (1) full step<br/>the following year. Subsequent to the initial year of employment and/or return<br/>from the first, official, unpaid leave of absence, a unit member who continues<br/>to receive above an unsatisfactory composite evaluation and whose contracted<br/>salary reflects fifty percent (50%) but less than seventy-five percent (75%) of<br/>the amount specified at his/her assigned step and class on the District's salary<br/>schedule shall advance one (1) step for each two (2) consecutive years of<br/>service.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be considered full time if his/her contracted salary reflects<br/>seventy-five percent (75%) or more of his/her assigned step and class on the<br/>salary schedule.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member whose contracted salary reflects twenty-five percent (25%) but<br/>less than fifty percent (50%) of the amount specified at his/her assigned step<br/>and class on the District's salary schedule shall advance one (1) step for each<br/>three (3) consecutive years of service. A unit member whose contracted salary<br/>reflects twenty percent (20%) of the amount specified at his/her assigned step<br/>and class on the District's salary schedule shall advance one (1) step for each<br/>four (4) consecutive years of service.</p>
<p>2. Junior Reserve Officer Training Corp</p>
<p>JROTC instructors hired after July 1, 2004, will be placed on the salary schedule in<br/>accordance with Article XII (Salaries), Section 2, of the Master Agreement. Under no condition<br/>will salary placement result in salary compensation which is less than tire established minimum by<br/>JROTC Cadet Command. Newly-hired JROTC instructors will be placed at A-l on the salary<br/>schedule and may receive a retroactive adjustment upon verification of salary placement by the<br/>Department of the Army. Board Policy 4141.1 will not apply to salary placement for JROTC<br/>instructors.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptable coursework taken without prior approval will be effective for salary<br/>advancement credit for the following school year if submitted by March 1 of<br/>the current school year. All other unapproved coursework submitted after<br/>March 1, will not be eligible for salary advancement credit until after the<br/>subsequent school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidelines for acceptable units and degrees, which must be from institutions<br/>accredited by the American Association of Schools and Colleges or a regional<br/>affiliate, are limited to the following:</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive credit for salary placement, the work must be completed by<br/>August 31 prior to the school year in which it is to be applied.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit shall not be granted until an official transcript has been received by the<br/>District. In all cases, the transcript shall be received on or before November<br/>1 of the school year in which credit is desired.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once units have been approved on the &quot;Request for Approval of College Units<br/>for Salary Schedule Advancement&quot; form, they may not, at a later date, be<br/>disapproved. This does not apply to initial salary schedule placement.</p>

<p>Errors in current salary schedule placement shall only be corrected during the fiscal year<br/>(July 1 - June 30) in which they are discovered. Such correction shall only apply to that fiscal year.</p>

<p>23</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>26<br/>27</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disciplinary action must be based upon just cause and according to the principles<br/>of progressive discipline. The steps listed below shall be followed in the progressive discipline<br/>process. However, steps may be skipped if the severity or nature of the offense justifies.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral warning</p>
<p>Oral warnings shall be the first step in all discipline procedures (except as noted<br/>above). No written record shall be placed in the unit member's District Office<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written warning</p>
<p>Written warnings shall not be used under this article unless the unit member<br/>has been orally warned within the last twelve (12) months. Written warnings<br/>shall not be placed in the unit member's District Office personnel file.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written reprimand</p>
<p>Written reprimands shall not be used under this article unless the unit member<br/>has received a written warning within the last twenty-four (24) months. The<br/>unit member shall sign the reprimand to acknowledge receipt and a copy may<br/>be placed in the unit member's District Office personnel file. The unit member<br/>may attach a rebuttal to the written reprimand at any time.</p>

In all instances, however, the length of the suspension shall<br/>relate to the severity of the action and suspension history of the unit member.<br/>Notice of suspension shall be made in writing and served in person or by<br/>certified mail upon the unit member by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any proposed suspension of a bargaining unit member shall be preceded by written<br/>notice of the right to appeal said action by filing a grievance. However, such grievance shall be</p>
<p>filed within ten (10) working days of the date that the unit member was served with notice of the<br/>suspension. The grievance shall be filed with the Office of the Director of Certificated Personnel<br/>or designee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no loss of pay to a unit member until after the completion of the<br/>grievance process if the action is challenged.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for determining whether there is just cause for suspensions, this Article shall<br/>be subject to grievance based on procedural violations only. However, a unit member may grieve<br/>whether a written reprimand is supported by just cause to the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Article shall prevent the District from using evidence of disciplinary<br/>offenses more than thirty-six (36) months old to the full extent permitted by law in teacher<br/>termination proceedings under the Education Code.</p>

<p>44043.5(a)(1) &quot;catastrophic illness&quot; or &quot;injury&quot; means an illness or injury that<br/>is expected to incapacitate the unit member for an extended period of time, or<br/>that incapacitates a member of the unit member's family which incapacity<br/>requires the unit member to take time off from work for an extended period<br/>of time for that family member, and taking extended time off work creates a<br/>financial hardship for the unit member because he or she has exhausted all of<br/>his or her sick leave and other time off.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Member: For purposes of this policy, a family member is defined as a<br/>spouse, child or step-child, legally adopted child, mother or father, step-mother<br/>or step-father, or any relative living in the home of the unit member</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Donation: The initial minimum donation is the equivalent of one<br/>day of earned sick leave for a full-time unit member. A minimum donation is<br/>required in order to be eligible to draw from the Program, and the donation<br/>must be made prior to the onset of the catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>h. Exhaustion of Leave Entitlement: The unit member has exhausted all paid<br/>leave entidement when all accrued paid leave, including sick leave differendal,<br/>has been used.</p>
<p>4. Procedure</p>

The unit member must have exhausted all entidement to paid leave in order<br/>to be eligible for leave donations. Verification of the nature of the illness/disability, anticipated<br/>length of absence, and prognosis for recovery must be provided by a medical doctor. Reasons<br/>requiring the presence of the unit member to care for a family member may be required. Further<br/>information such as information of financial hardship may be requested by the Committee.</p>
<p>Final determination of whether to grant the catastrophic leave will be made by a majority<br/>vote of the Catastrophic Leave Committee. Consideration will be given to whether the<br/>incapacitated unit member has a permanent disability.</p>
<p>Leave requests will be evaluated monthly. Pay will not be granted for any day the unit<br/>member is not formally scheduled to work.

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>BETWEEN</p>

<p>MANTECA EDUCATORS ASSOCIATI0N/MEA/CTA/NEA</p>
<p>As a condition of receiving the additional funding grant for K-3 class size reduction under the<br/>LCFF, the District is required to make progress toward maintaining an average class size<br/>enrollment of not more than 24 pupils for each school site in Kindergarten and grades 1 -3 upon<br/>full implementation of the LCFF (currently 2020), as such progress is defined in education code<br/>section 42238.02. The parties intend for the District to be in compliance with this law as<br/>interpreted by subsequent guidelines and regulations of the California Department of Education<br/>upon full implementation of the LCFF as set forth of Education Code section 42238.02 (d)(3)<br/>(D).</p>
<p>The District shall implement an alternative annual average class size enrollment for grades K-3<br/>District wide incompliance with Education Code 42238.02 (d)(3)(B). The grades K-3 maximum<br/>average class size will reduce by one student each year until the 24 to 1 class size ratio is met by<br/>the full CSR implementation timeline. Consequently the amount of annual progress at each<br/>individual school site shall be flexible and shall not be tied to the (making annual progress)<br/>formula in law (Ed. Code, 42238.02(d)(3)(B)(i)-(v).</p>
<p>Should this MOU or any part of it be found to not comply with Ed. Code, 42238.02 (d)(3)(B), or<br/>to not provide an effective modification of the class size reduction formula, this agreement is null<br/>and void and the parties will meet to negotiate alternatives.</p>
<p>This agreement will have unlimited reopeners until the CSR target has been met.</p>
