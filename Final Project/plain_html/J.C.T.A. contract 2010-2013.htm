<p>ARTICLE 1</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1.1 The Articles and paragraphs contained herein constitute the agreement (“Agreement”)</p>
<p>between the Governing Board of the Jacoby Creek School Charter District (“Board”) and<br/>the Jacoby Creek Teachers’ Association (JCTA”), an employee organization, pursuant to<br/>Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540-3549 of the Government Code (“Act’*).</p>
<p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from July 1, 2007 until June 30,</p>
<p>2010.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2<br/>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition. The Board confirms its recognition of the JCTA as the exclusive</p>
<p>representative for that unit of employees defined as follows:</p>
<p>All certificated employees, excluding management, confidential, supervisory and<br/>substitute employees.</p>
<p>2.2 Non-Bargaining Unit Personnel. The parties to this Agreement recognize that the duties<br/>and work performed by the bargaining unit described above shall be performed only by<br/>unit members unless there are no unit members who are qualified ana interested in<br/>performing the work, in which case the District may utilize appropriate certificated non¬<br/>bargaining unit personnel.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3</p>
<p>NEGOTIATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JCTA and the Board shall annually present to each other a list of intended areas of</p>
<p>negotiations for the following school year no later than March 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>3.2 As soon after March 8<sup>th</sup>, as possible, both parties will submit specific initial proposals for<br/>public notice.</p>
<p>3.3 Bargaining will commence as soon as possible after the initial proposals have been</p>
<p>“sunshinea”. A good faith effort will be made by all parties to arrive at an agreement<br/>before end of the school year. Recognizing the vagaries of funding in public education,<br/>we realize this is not always achievable.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>3.4 Meetings shall occur at mutually convenient times and places. It is understood that the<br/>Association has the right to reasonable release time to negotiate during their regularly<br/>Contracted work day. Both parties will make reasonable accommodation for schedules<br/>of participants to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4</p>
<p>MAINTENACE AND APPLICATION OF STANDARDS</p>
<p>4.1 The Board shall not reduce or eliminate any benefits or professional advantages which<br/>are mandatory topics of bargaining and which were enjoyed by unit members as of the<br/>effective date of the Agreement unless otherwise provided by the express terms of this<br/>Agreement, a subsequent agreement of the parties, or completion of the impasse<br/>procedures.</p>
<p>4.2 This Agreement will supersede any rules, regulations or practice of the Board which are<br/>or may in the future be contrary to or inconsistent with its terms. It shall not supersede<br/>applicable state or federal law. Only mandatory changes in federal or state law shall<br/>diminish the provisions of this contract.</p>
<p>4.3 The provisions of this Agreement and rules which are designed to implement it shall be<br/>uniform in application and effect.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5</p>
<p>NON-DISCRIMINATION</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Discrimination. No party to this Agreement shall discriminate against any employee<br/>or official of the District on the basis or race, color, creed, age, sex, national origin,<br/>political affiliation, marital status, sexual orientation, physical handicap, membership or<br/>non-membership in an employee organization or participation or non-participation in the<br/>activities of an employee organization, all as may be prohibited by applicable state or<br/>federal law.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment Interviews. Employment application forms and oral hiring interview<br/>procedures shall not refer to membership in or preference for the exclusive<br/>representative, any other employee organization or no representative.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6</p>
<p>SAVINGS</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement is held to be contrary to law by a court of competent<br/>jurisdiction, then such provision shall not deemed valid except to the permitted by law,<br/>but all other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is further agreed that within 10 davs of either party’s request following notification of<br/>the court’s decision, the parties shall begin negotiations regarding matters related to such<br/>provision.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>STATUTORY CHANGES</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements in benefits included in this Agreement which are brought about by the<br/>amendment or addition of statutory guarantees now provided in California or federal law<br/>shall be incorporated into this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction or elimination benefits which are brought about by the amendment or repeal of<br/>statutory guarantees incorporated into this Agreement shall obligate the parties within ten<br/>(10) days of either party’s request to negotiate. (In no case shall an amendment or repeal<br/>of statutory guarantees automatically reduce this agreement unless that amendment or<br/>repeal specifically states that it negate current contract language.)</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8</p>
<p>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS/INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS</p>
<p>8.1 The individual contracts between the Board and individual unit members shall be subject<br/>to and consistent with this Agreement.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ARTICLE 9</p>
<p>CONTRACT MAINTENANCE</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a claim by one or more unit members or the JCTA that there has<br/>been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of a specific provision of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “aggrieved” party is the person or persons making the claim.</p>
<p>9.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is any day in which a unit member is required to render services to the<br/>District.</p>
<p>9.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “party of interest” is any person who might be required to take action or against<br/>whom action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose. The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative<br/>level, equitable solutions to the problems which may from time to time arise in the<br/>interpretation or application of this Agreement. Both parties agree that these proceedings<br/>will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Problem Solving- Step 1</p>
<p>9.3.1.1 Prior to the filling of any grievances form, the teacher, teachers, and/or</p>
<p>Association designated representative shall schedule a conference with the<br/>Administrator to discuss the problem that could precipitate a grievance.<br/>The Administrator shall have five (5) working days to consider the<br/>problem, at which time the Administrator will be present in writing a<br/>proposed solution. The Administrator may schedule a conference for this<br/>purpose.</p>
<p>9.3.2 An individual unit member may be accompanied at all stages of this<br/>procedure by a JCTA designated representative(s).</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Problem Solving (grievance) -Step 2</p>
<p>If an acceptable solution is not achieved at the informal step, or if no timely<br/>disposition has been made, a grievance shall be presented in writing to the<br/>Administrator using the grievance form (Appendix D). The Administrator shall<br/>meet with the grievant and the JCTA designated representative within five (5)<br/>days of receipt of the written grievance form. The Administrator shall provide a<br/>written disposition of the grievance, including all reasons there, to all parties of<br/>interest within five (5) days of such meeting.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Problem Solving (grievance) - Step 3</p>
<p>If the grievant or JCTA is dissatisfied with the disposition or if no timely disposition has<br/>been made at Step 2, it may have the matter reviewed by the Board. The JCTA may<br/>cause the matter to be heard by placing the matter on the Board agenda. The Board shall<br/>provide a written response within twenty-five (25) days of the Board meeting to all<br/>parties of interest.</p>
<p>9.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Problem Solving (grievance) - Step 4</p>
<p>9.3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved party is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance, or if no<br/>disposition has occurred within twenty (20) days of such a meeting, the aggrieved<br/>party may request JCTA submit the grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>9.3.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If JCTA proceeds to arbitration, within fifteen (15) days it shall notify the Board<br/>in writing. Within ten (10) days of such notification, representatives of the Board<br/>and JCTA shall request a panel of five (5) arbitrators from the California<br/>Conciliation and Mediation Service. The selection of the arbitrator and the<br/>arbitration proceedings shall occur pursuant to the alternative strike method<br/>between the parties.</p>
<p>9.3.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth the findings of fact,<br/>reasoning and conclusions of the issues submitted. The arbitrator will be without<br/>power or authority to make any decision which requires the commission of an act<br/>prohibited by law or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement. However,<br/>it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to include in nay award such as<br/>financial reimbursement or other remedies as she/he judges to be proper.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall review and consider the Board’s action taken at Step 3 prior to<br/>making a decision.</p>
<p>The decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to JCTA and the Board and will<br/>be final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p>If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such question will be<br/>ruled upon by the arbitrator only after he/she has had an opportunity to hear the<br/>merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>9.4.4 All costs for the service of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem<br/>expenses, travel and subsistence expenses, and the cost of any hearing room, will<br/>be borne equally by the Board and the Association. All other costs, except for the<br/>release time for the grievant(s), JCTA representatives and witnesses, will be borne<br/>by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Limits</p>
<p>9.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1, the informal part of this process, must be begun no more than forty-five<br/>(45) days after the event giving rise to the grievance first occurs or could<br/>reasonably been known to have occurred.</p>
<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits for each level shall begin the day following receipt of the grievance,<br/>grievance appeal or written decision.</p>
<p>9.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time<br/>limits specified at each level should be considered to be maximums and every<br/>effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be<br/>extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>9.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through<br/>all the steps in this procedure by the end of the school year and, if left unresolved<br/>until the beginning of the following school year, could result in harm to an<br/>aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the<br/>procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year, or as soon as is<br/>practical.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Reprisals. No reprisals of any kind will be taken by either party against any person</p>
<p>for participation or non-participation in this process.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>9.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As necessary, a JCTA representative will be released without loss of pay to attend<br/>a grievance meeting or hearing. Any unit member who is requested to appear as<br/>witnesses will be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>9.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the<br/>personnel file of any of the participants.</p>
<p>9.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon mutual agreement of JCTA and the Administration, any grievance may be<br/>taken directly to the Board.</p>
<p>9.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon mutual agreement of JCTA and the Board, any grievance may be taken<br/>directly to arbitration.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>9.6.5 A unit member may at any time, present grievances to the employer, and have<br/>such grievances resolved, without the intervention of JCTA, as long as the<br/>resolved is consistent with the terms of this Agreement. If an employee presents a<br/>grievance on her/his own behalf, JCTA shall have the right to be present and state<br/>its views at all grievance meetings. The Administrator or Board shall not agree to<br/>resolution of the grievance until JCTA has received a copy of the grievance and<br/>the proposed resolution and has been given opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>9.7 Expedited Arbitration. At the option of JCTA or the District, the arbitration may be held<br/>under the Expedited Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Notice of such<br/>option shall accompany the request for a list of arbitrators.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10<br/>DUES DEDUCTION</p>

<p>10</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12</p>
<p>REASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Principle. The parties believe in encouraging voluntary transfers, while<br/>recognizing to need for a teacher to experience an assignment for a least a few<br/>consecutive years to develop their program.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassignment is the movement of a probationary or permanent unit member<br/>from one subject area to another subject area or one grade level to another grade<br/>level at the same work location.</p>
<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy is any position not held by a unit member which the Board seeks to<br/>fill.</p>
<p>12.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority is defined as the unit member’s initial dates of service in the bargaining<br/>unit with the following provisions.</p>
<p>12.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is assigned to a non-bargaining unit position<br/>within the District, that unit member does not accrue seniority for<br/>the purposes of this Article while working on that assignment.</p>
<p>12.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member’s seniority shall accrue during layoff.</p>
<p>12.2.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other qualifications being equal, decisions on notice of filling<br/>assignments, vacancies, on filling voluntary assignments or<br/>imposing all involuntary reassignments shall be based on seniority.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of Assignment</p>
<p>12.3.1 Each unit member shall be given written notice not later than May 25<sup>th</sup> of the next<br/>year’s assignment. Such notice shall specify the position, grade level and/or<br/>subject area to which the unit member will be assigned. This assignment shall be<br/>firm barring major unforeseen or contingent circumstance. (Under “contingent<br/>circumstance” for example, a teacher may be told they will teach kindergarten<br/>unless there are not a specified number of kindergarten students, in which case the<br/>assignment will be a K-l combination.) Should either of these circumstances<br/>occur, the District shall confer with the teacher involved and the Association,<br/>giving the reasons, in writing, for the proposed change. An attempt will be made<br/>to find alternative solutions. All this will occur at the earliest reasonable date<br/>after the District is aware of the problem.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>12.3.3 Except for voluntary or involuntary reassignments, the District will attempt to</p>
<p>maintain teachers in the same assignment under paragraph 12.3.1 for at least two<br/>and one-half full years. A change in assignment in a shorter period may occur as<br/>a result of, but is not limited to, the need to shift teachers following a change in<br/>the school’s grade level structure from one year to the next or the return of a<br/>teacher from a leave. If this occurs, volunteers will be solicited by posting before<br/>any reassignments are made.</p>
<p>If a teacher is to be moved more than once in a two and one-half year period ,<br/>prior to May 20<sup>th</sup> an administrator, board member(s), the affected teacher(s) and<br/>the Association will meet at the request of any of the aforementioned participants<br/>to discuss the issue in a good-faith attempt to reach resolution. A real effort will<br/>be made to keep reassignments to a minimum and to distribute reassignments<br/>equitably among the staff, considering the nature of assignment, the interests of<br/>the affected unit members, and, in particular, the seniority of the unit members (if<br/>the least senior member has been moved in the past two and on-half years, the<br/>more senior unit members will be considered).</p>
<p>12.4 Vacancies</p>
<p>12.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrator shall deliver to the Association and post a list of vacancies and<br/>new positions that occur during the school year and for the following year upon<br/>knowledge of the vacancies, including the following:</p>
<p>12.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closing date of at least ten (10) working days following the<br/>posting date. In emergencies this date may be waived by a joint<br/>decision of the Administrator and the Association. If this<br/>emergency occurs outside of the regular school year, this decision<br/>may be made, jointly, by the Administrator and two of the five<br/>designees, authorized for this purpose. The Association will<br/>provide the Administrator with a list of the currently authorized<br/>representatives.</p>
<p>12.4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A job description.</p>
<p>12.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications necessary to meet the requirements of the<br/>position.</p>
<p>12.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No assignment to fill the vacancy or newly created position shall be made until<br/>the closing date.</p>
<p>12.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No outside applicant shall be selected to fill the vacancy or newly created position<br/>if there is a qualified unit member applicant.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>12.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member’s request for reassignment is denied, the unit member shall be<br/>entitled to a meeting with the Administrator and shall receive written reasons for<br/>the denial within five (5) days following said meeting, and copy shall be sent to<br/>the Association.</p>
<p>12.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall notify each unit member during summer recess or period of<br/>leave of any posted openings which may arise during summer recess or period of<br/>leave. This notification shall be made by regular mail. If a waiver has been<br/>granted to shorten the closing date time the District will attempt to notify each<br/>Association member by telephone, followed by notification by regular mail.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Reassignment</p>
<p>12.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may submit a request for a reassignment (including the<br/>reassignment of certificated support staff, such as the music teacher, reading specialist,<br/>etc.) To the District at any time, whether or not a vacancy exists. A unit member may<br/>also submit a request for a reassignment subsequent to the posting of a vacancy notice<br/>pursuant to this Article.</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member’s request for reassignment is denied, the unit member shall be<br/>entitled to a meeting with the Administrator to discuss the reasons. The unit<br/>member may request and shall receive written reasons for the denial within five</p>
<p>(5) days following said meeting, and a copy shall be sent to the Association.</p>
<p>12.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassignment request shall not be denied arbitrarily or without basis in fact.</p>
<p>12.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning from leave shall be afforded all rights provided under this<br/>section.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Reassignment Support</p>
<p>12.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary reassignments are made fill a vacancy from within after the start of<br/>the school year.</p>
