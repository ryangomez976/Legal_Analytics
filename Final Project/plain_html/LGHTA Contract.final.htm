<p>ARTICLE 1</p>
<p>TERM</p>
<p>This collective bargaining agreement between the Le Grand Union High School District<br/>(“District”) and the Le Grand Union High School Teachers Association (“Association”),<br/>an independent local teachers’ association, is entered into on June 22, 2011 pursuant to<br/>the provisions of the Education Employees Relations Act (“EERA”), Government Code<br/>section 3540 et. seq. The term of this Agreement shall be from August 1, 2012 to June<br/>30, 2015.</p>
<p>This Agreement is intended to cover all matters relating to wages, hours and working<br/>conditions.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall continue until a new agreement is reached, or until the impasse<br/>procedures of the EERA are exhausted, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2<br/>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>All full-time certificated positions shall be included within the bargaining unit except<br/>management, supervisory, and confidential employee positions, long-term substitutes<br/>employed for one semester or less in a school year, day-to-day substitutes, retirees who<br/>return to service and are employed in a temporary capacity, summer school teachers<br/>who are not regular employees of the District, and the positions of counselor, school<br/>psychologist, and school nurse if such a position exists.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3<br/>NEGOTIATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>No later than February 15 of the school year in which this Agreement expires or in<br/>which there is a reopener, the Association shall submit its initial proposal to the<br/>Governing Board.

<p>1</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The purpose of this Article is to provide a procedure for consideration of grievances. A<br/>grievance is an allegation that the District has violated, misapplied, or misinterpreted the<br/>Agreement. Grievances may be filed by the Association or by an individual member of<br/>the Association, who shall be known as the “grievant.”</p>
<p>The grievant and District will attempt to resolve all grievances at the lowest possible<br/>level.</p>
<p>The timelines in this grievance procedure shall be interpreted strictly. If the District fails<br/>to meet its decision deadlines, the grievant shall be entitled to appeal to the next higher<br/>level. If the grievant fails to meet a deadline, he or she waives the right to further<br/>pursue the grievance. The parties may extend any timeline by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>The grievant must follow the direction of his/her supervisor while pursuing the grievance<br/>process.</p>
<p>The grievant has the right to have a representative present at any level of the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>Grievance processing meetings will be scheduled at times which do not interfere with<br/>the regular work day. However, if the District needs to schedule a grievance meeting<br/>during a workday, release time will be granted to the grievant, the grievant’s<br/>representative, and any other employee required to participate as a witness.</p>
<p>An employee who has filed a grievance may withdraw the grievance at any time.</p>
<p>Informal Level</p>
<p>A grievant shall first present a grievance orally to the site principal. If an informal<br/>resolution is not reached, the grievant may file a formal grievance which must be in<br/>writing on the official grievance form attached as Appendix D to this Agreement.</p>
<p>Formal Level One</p>
<p>A formal grievance must be filed at Level One with the Superintendent or designee<br/>within fifteen (15) work days after the grievant knew, or reasonably should have known<br/>of the circumstances which form the basis for the grievance.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall have seven (7) work days to respond in writing to<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>Formal Level Two</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the response at Level One, he or she has ten (10)<br/>work days from service of the Level One decision to appeal the grievance to the<br/>Governing Board. The grievant must obtain the written approval of the Association in<br/>order to appeal the grievance to Level Two. The Governing Board will, if practicable,<br/>consider the grievance at its next regularly-scheduled meeting. The decision of the<br/>Governing Board is final.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5<br/>LEAVES</p>
<p>Sick Leave</p>
<p>Full-time certificated employees are entitled to 10 days leave of absence with full pay for<br/>personal illness or injury per school year. An employee who works less than 5 days per<br/>week shall be granted sick leave in proportion to assigned hours of work. Sick leave<br/>shall be taken in minimum 30 minute increments.</p>
<p>An employee may take sick leave at any time during the school year, even if credit for<br/>sick leave has not yet been accrued. An employee who does not complete a given year<br/>of service shall have deducted from his or her final paycheck any unearned sick leave<br/>used as of the date of separation from service.</p>
<p>Unused days of sick leave shall be accumulated from year to year without limitation. At<br/>the beginning of each school year, employees shall be notified of the amount of sick<br/>leave they have accumulated.</p>
<p>Any certificated employee who leaves the District after at least one year of employment<br/>and accepts a certificated position in another California school district, county office of<br/>education, or community college district within one year shall have transferred with<br/>him/her the total amount of accumulated sick leave. The District shall not require new<br/>employees to waive their sick leave accumulated in a previous California school district,<br/>county office of education, or community college district.</p>
<p>Sick leave may be used for:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases of temporary inability to perform duties because of illness, accident<br/>or quarantine, whether or not the cause of absence arises out of and in the course of<br/>employment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences due to pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical and dental appointments</p>
<p>An employee shall notify the District of his/her need to be absent as soon as such need<br/>is known so that substitute services may be secured. This notification shall include an<br/>estimate of the expected duration of the absence. If the absence becomes longer than</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>estimated, the employee shall notify the District not later than 3 p.m. of the day<br/>preceding the day on which the employee intends to return to work. If failure to so notify<br/>the District results in a substitute being secured, the cost of the substitute shall be<br/>deducted from the employee’s pay.</p>
<p>Extended Illness or Injury Leave</p>
<p>A certificated employee shall receive the difference between his/her salary and the<br/>salary actually paid a substitute, or if no substitute was hired the amount a substitute<br/>would have been paid according to the substitute salary schedule, during any period of<br/>absence due to illness or injury up to five months, beginning after all available paid<br/>leave has been exhausted.</p>
<p>After five months, if a certificated employee has exhausted all available sick leave and<br/>is not medically able to resume his/her duties with or without reasonable<br/>accommodation, the employee shall be placed either in another position or on a<br/>reemployment list. If the employee is on probationary status, he/she shall be placed on<br/>the reemployment list for 24 months beginning at the expiration of the 5 month period.<br/>If the employee is on permanent status, he/she shall be placed on the reemployment list<br/>for 39 months. If during this time the employee becomes medically able, he/she shall<br/>be returned to employment in a position for which he/she is credentialed and qualified.</p>
<p>The District shall be able to satisfy its legal obligations under state and federal law<br/>pertaining to disabled employees by negotiating reasonable accommodations directly<br/>with affected employees.</p>
<p>Verification Requirements</p>
<p>For any absence due to mental or physical illness or injury, the employee shall verify the<br/>absence by submitting a completed and signed District absence form to the site<br/>principal. The Superintendent or designee may require additional written verification by<br/>the employee’s physician, chiropractor, physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner<br/>whenever an employee’s absence record shows chronic absenteeism or a pattern of<br/>absences immediately before or after weekends and/or holidays or whenever<br/>substantial evidence indicates that an absence is not related to illness or injury.</p>
<p>If the District doubts the validity of an absence form, the District may require the<br/>employee to obtain a second opinion from a health care provider selected by the District<br/>at District expense. If the second opinion is contrary to the first, the District may require<br/>the employee to obtain a third medical opinion from a third health care provider<br/>approved by both the employee and the District, again at District expense. The third<br/>medical opinion shall be conclusive.</p>
<p>Before returning to work, an employee who has been absent for surgery, hospitalization,<br/>or an absence of more than 10 consecutive work days may be asked to submit a letter<br/>from his/her physician stating that he/she is able to return to work with or without</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>restrictions. The District may require the employee to obtain a second opinion from a<br/>health care provider selected by the District at District expense. If the second opinion is<br/>contrary to the first, the District may require the employee to obtain a third medical<br/>opinion from a third health care provider approved by both the employee and the<br/>District, again at District expense. The third medical opinion shall be conclusive.</p>
<p>Industrial Accident/lllness Leave</p>
<p>In each school year, a certificated employee is entitled to 60 work days of leave for any<br/>single industrial accident or illness. Allowable industrial accident/illness leave shall not<br/>accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>When a certificated employee is absent from duty because of an industrial accident or<br/>illness:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident/illness leave shall start on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be paid such portion of the salary due for any month<br/>in which the absence occurs, so that when added to the temporary disability indemnity<br/>check provided the employee, will result in a payment to the employee of not more than<br/>his/her full salary.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident/illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day<br/>of authorized absence, regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal<br/>year, the employee is entitled to only the amount of unused leave due the employee for<br/>the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>Upon expiration of allowable leave for an industrial accident or illness, the employee<br/>may use sick leave. If the employee continues to receive temporary disability<br/>indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much of the accumulated sick leave which, when<br/>added to the temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to the employee of<br/>not more than the employee’s full salary.</p>
<p>During any paid leave of absence, the employee may endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of the industrial accident or<br/>illness. In those cases, the District shall issue appropriate salary warrants for payment<br/>of the employee’s salary, and shall deduct normal retirement, other authorized<br/>contributions, and the temporary disability indemnity, if any, actually paid to and<br/>retained by the employee for periods covered by such salary warrants.</p>
<p>Any employee receiving benefits under this leave shall, during periods of injury or<br/>illness, remain within the State of California unless the Governing Board authorizes<br/>travel outside the State.</p>
<p>STRS Disability Leave</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The Governing Board may grant a leave of absence to any certificated employee who<br/>has applied for disability benefits, not to exceed 30 days beyond final determination of<br/>the employee’s eligibility for disability benefits by the State Teachers’ Retirement<br/>System (STRS). If the employee is determined to be eligible, that leave shall be<br/>extended for the term of the disability, but not more than 39 months.</p>
<p>Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>Employees are entitled to a leave of up to three days, or five days if the bereavement<br/>necessitates one-way travel of at least 150 miles, upon the death of any member of the<br/>employee’s immediate family. No deduction shall be made from the employee’s salary,<br/>nor shall such leave be deducted from any other leave to which the employee is<br/>entitled.</p>
<p>Members of the immediate family include the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather,<br/>or grandchild of the employee or of the employee’s spouse, the employee’s spouse,<br/>son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother or sister, aunt or uncle, or any<br/>relative living in the employee’s immediate household.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>Employees may use up to seven days of their accrued sick leave during each contract<br/>year for reasons of personal necessity.</p>
<p>Acceptable reasons for the use of personal necessity leave include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of a member of the immediate family when the number of days of<br/>absence exceeds the limits set by bereavement leave provisions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving the employee’s person or property or the person or<br/>property of a member of the employee’s immediate family, such accident must be a)<br/>serious in nature, b) involve circumstances the employee cannot reasonably be<br/>expected to disregard, and c) require the attention of the employee during his/her<br/>assigned hours of service.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious illness of a member of the employee’s immediate family. An<br/>employee is entitled to use up to five days of sick leave for illness of the employee’s<br/>child, parent, or spouse even if employee has used up his or her personal necessity<br/>leave for other reasons in any given year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in any court or before any administrative tribunal as a litigant,<br/>party or witness under subpoena or other order.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imminent danger to the home of the employee, occasioned by a factor<br/>such as a flood or fire, serious in nature, which under the circumstances cannot</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>reasonably be disregarded, and which requires the attention of the employee during<br/>assigned hours of service.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weddings of members of the immediate family.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduation or commencement ceremonies for a member of the immediate</p>

<p>“Reassignment” is a change in subject area.</p>
<p>“Transfer” is a change in work location from one campus to another.</p>

<p>Voluntary Transfer/Reassignment</p>
<p>The District will notify all certificated employees of certificated vacancies in a timely<br/>manner by prominently posting on a bulletin board at each school site a notice of the<br/>vacancy.</p>
<p>The District will specify the number of days for employees to apply which may vary from<br/>3 to 14 days depending on the needs of the District.</p>
<p>When the District receives more than one transfer/reassignment request, the decision to<br/>fill the vacancy shall be based on the following factors:</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance in Interview</p>
<p>11</p>

<p>The District reserves the right to recruit outside applicants for any vacant position if it<br/>believes doing so would be in the best interests of students and the instructional<br/>program.</p>
<p>All employees shall maintain all degrees, credentials and qualifications held at the time<br/>they were hired so as to afford the District flexibility in assignment. The District may<br/>bind an employee upon initial hire to maintaining all credentials and qualifications<br/>needed for the positions for which they were hired if such language is included in their<br/>initial contract.</p>
<p>Involuntary Transfer/Reassignment</p>
<p>Prior to initiating an involuntary transfer/reassignment, the Superintendent will meet with<br/>the affected employee(s) to discuss the proposed transfer/reassignment.</p>
<p>If a certificated employee is reassigned after the beginning of the school year, he/she<br/>shall be entitled to up to three (3) days of release time, as needed, in order to prepare<br/>for the new assignment.</p>

The evaluation criteria shall include the “Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession” as adopted by the State Board of Education and the California Commission<br/>on Teacher Credentialing in 1997, and the “Critical Teaching Attributes” as shown in<br/>appendix “G.”</p>
<p>Certificated employee performance shall be evaluated and assessed on a continuing<br/>basis, at least once a year for probationary staff and at least every other year for<br/>permanent staff. Permanent employees who receive an unsatisfactory evaluation shall<br/>be assessed annually until they receive a satisfactory evaluation or are separated from<br/>the District.</p>
<p>Probationary teachers shall be formally observed and given constructive feedback at<br/>least once each semester and more often when necessary, as part of the evaluation<br/>process. Within three school days of each formal observation, a conference shall be<br/>held between the evaluator and the probationary teacher.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall assess the performance of certificated<br/>instructional staff as it reasonably relates to the following criteria:</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students' progress toward District standards of expected achievement for<br/>their grade level in each area of study and, if applicable, towards the state-adopted<br/>content standards as measured by state-adopted criterion-referenced assessments</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee's adherence to curricular objectives</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment<br/>within the scope of the employee's responsibilities</p>
<p>The evaluation of certificated employee performance shall not include the use of<br/>publishers' norms established by standardized tests.</p>
<p>Evaluations shall include recommendations, if necessary, as to areas in need of<br/>improvement in the employee's performance. If an employee is not performing<br/>satisfactorily according to teacher standards approved by the Board pursuant to<br/>Education Code section 44662, the Superintendent or designee shall so notify the<br/>employee in writing and describe the unsatisfactory performance. The Superintendent<br/>or designee shall confer with the employee, make specific recommendations as to<br/>areas needing improvement and endeavor to provide assistance to the employee in<br/>his/her performance.</p>

<p>Any employee who receives an unsatisfactory rating in the area of teaching methods or<br/>instruction shall participate in the District's peer assistance and review program.<br/>Results of an employee's participation in the peer assistance and review program shall<br/>be made available as part of the employee's evaluation.</p>
<p>Certificated instructional employees shall receive a written copy of their evaluation no<br/>later than 30 days before the last day of the school year in which the evaluation takes<br/>place. Before the last day of the school year, the employee and the evaluator shall meet<br/>to discuss the evaluation.</p>
<p>Certificated employees shall have the right to respond in writing to their evaluation. This<br/>response shall become a permanent attachment to the employee's personnel file.</p>
<p>Permanent teachers who receive an evaluation with any categories marked<br/>unsatisfactory or needs improvement may be evaluated on an annual basis until<br/>performance improves.</p>
<p>The evaluation form which shall be used to document employee performance is<br/>attached as Appendix C.</p>
<p>B. Personnel Files</p>
<p>A personnel file will be kept on each employee and maintained in confidence at the<br/>District Office and accessed only on a “need to know” basis.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Information of a derogatory nature shall not be entered into an employee’s personnel<br/>file unless the employee is given 10 work days notice and an opportunity to review and<br/>comment on that information.</p>
<p>An employee shall have the opportunity to inspect their personnel file during the duty<br/>day but not during instructional time.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8<br/>PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW (PAR)</p>
<p>Joint Panel</p>
<p>The joint teacher-administrator peer review panel shall:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select teachers to serve as consulting teachers and submit their name(s)<br/>to the Superintendent or his designee(s) for approval</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review peer review reports prepared by consulting teachers</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make recommendations to the Board of Trustees regarding participants in<br/>the peer assistance and review program including forwarding to the Board the names of<br/>individuals who, after sustained assistance, have been unable to demonstrate<br/>satisfactory improvement</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annually evaluate the impact of the program in order to improve the<br/>program, including but not limited to, interviews or surveys of program participants, and<br/>submit any recommendations for improvement to the Board and exclusive<br/>representative of certificated employees in the District</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adopt appropriate procedures for the panel's operation, consistent with<br/>Board policy and the underlying statutory provisions.</p>
<p>The panel shall consist of three members, the majority of whom shall be classroom<br/>teachers. Two members shall be selected to serve on the panel by a vote of the<br/>classroom teachers, to be held each September. One member of the panel shall be a<br/>certificated administrator who shall be selected to serve on the panel by the<br/>Superintendent or his designee each September.</p>
<p>Voluntary and Involuntary Participation</p>
<p>Teachers may volunteer to participate in the program or may be referred as a result of<br/>an unsatisfactory rating in their performance evaluation. Teachers also may be referred<br/>pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>A teacher shall be referred to the program upon receipt of an unsatisfactory<br/>performance evaluation. Once referred, the teacher may not withdraw from the program<br/>without approval of both the panel and the site administrator. An unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation should mean one in which a teacher receives any &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; indication<br/>or at least two &quot;needs to improve&quot; indications.</p>
<p>Any classroom teacher with permanent status who has not been involuntarily assigned<br/>may volunteer to participate in the program for the purpose of obtaining peer assistance<br/>to improve performance. A voluntary participant may withdraw from the program at any<br/>time. A voluntary participant will not receive a performance review from the Consulting<br/>Teacher unless the participant so requests. Volunteers will be accepted into the<br/>program subject to available funding, after all involuntary participants have been<br/>included.</p>
<p>A teacher participating in the program shall be a permanent employee of the District.</p>
<p>Selection of Consulting Teachers</p>
<p>Consulting teachers shall be selected by the majority vote of the joint teacher-<br/>administrator peer review panel. The selection process shall include provisions for the<br/>panel to observe the candidate's classroom.</p>
<p>A consulting teacher may be an employee of a different school District.</p>
<p>A teacher selected to serve as a consulting teacher shall:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have substantial recent experience in classroom instruction</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have demonstrated exemplary teaching ability as indicated by, at a<br/>minimum, effective communication skills, subject matter knowledge, and mastery of a<br/>range of teaching strategies necessary to meet the needs of students in different<br/>contexts</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a credentialed classroom teacher with permanent status in the District<br/>Program Components</p>
<p>The District's peer assistance and review program shall include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written performance goals for an individual teacher that are clearly stated,<br/>aligned with student learning and consistent with the evaluation criteria specified in<br/>Education Code section 44662.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance and review through multiple observations of a teacher during<br/>periods of classroom instruction</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cooperative relationship between the consulting teacher and the<br/>principal with respect to the process of peer assistance and review</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient staff development activities to assist a teacher to improve<br/>his/her teaching skills and knowledge</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monitoring component with a written record</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible after assignment to active status, the Consulting<br/>Teacher, Participating Teacher and site administrator will meet to review the employee's<br/>performance and recommendations for improvement. The Consulting Teacher will then<br/>prepare an Assistance Plan, which will include goals and objectives for improvement<br/>and a projected date for completion, which will ordinarily be at the end of the current<br/>school year. The plan will be submitted to the panel for final development and approval.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the school year, or at a later date if specified in the<br/>Assistance Plan, the Consulting Teacher shall make a final report to the panel, the<br/>Participating Teacher, and, if the Participating Teacher has been assigned to the<br/>program involuntarily, to the evaluator. A copy of the final report may be included in the<br/>Participating Teacher's personnel file after he or she has had an opportunity to review<br/>and comment on it. The Final Report shall not constitute the District's evaluation of the<br/>employee's performance but, in the case of a Participating Teacher who has been<br/>assigned to the program involuntarily, shall (and in the case of a Voluntary Participation<br/>may at his or her request) be considered by the site administrator in preparing any<br/>evaluation document or proposing any personnel action.</p>
<p>The final evaluation of a teacher's participation in the program shall be made available<br/>for placement in the teacher's personnel file.</p>
<p>Indemnity</p>
<p>The District will defend and indemnify panel members and Consulting Teachers against<br/>claims arising out of their good faith performance of duties under this Article. Panel<br/>members who act pursuant to the program shall have the same protection from liability<br/>and access to appropriate defense as other public school employees pursuant to<br/>Division 3.6 (commencing with section 810) of Title 1 of the Government Code.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 9<br/>WORKDAY AND WORKYEAR</p>
<p>The regular teacher workday shall be 7 % hours per day with starting and ending times to<br/>be determined by the Superintendent. Teachers are entitled to a one-half hour duty-free<br/>lunch.</p>
<p>Teachers shall be responsible for performing other professional duties outside of the<br/>regular teacher workday which include but are not limited to parent conferences, special</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>help to students, program development, professional growth activities, faculty and District<br/>meetings, back-to-school night, open house, graduation, round-up and other<br/>school/community events.</p>
<p>In a typical school year, there will be no more than 20 faculty and District meetings and<br/>school/community events. Faculty and District meetings shall not regularly exceed an<br/>hour in duration.</p>
<p>Certificated employees, except those teaching at Granada High School, will be entitled to<br/>one period of preparation time during which they may prepare lessons, collaborate with<br/>colleagues, or attend departmental meetings.</p>
<p>The District will endeavor to secure the services of a substitute teacher for a teacher who<br/>is absent. If the District is not able to get a substitute teacher, it may require certificated<br/>employees on occasion to cover other teachers’ classes during their preparation periods.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrator or administrative designee may direct a teacher to cover<br/>another teacher's class during his/her preparation period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the classroom coverage requires the teacher to be in the classroom in<br/>excess of 15 minutes, the teacher will receive compensation at the pro-rated daily<br/>regular short term substitute rate (one-fifth for a six period day, one-third for a four<br/>period day).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher arranges for classroom coverage on a voluntary basis with<br/>another teacher, it must be first cleared with an administrator or administrative<br/>designee. Such classroom coverage will not be subject to monetary compensation by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If circumstances arise that require more than one teacher to cover the<br/>same class, during the same period, the total compensation for that period will not<br/>exceed the proportionate share of the daily regular short term substitute rate described<br/>in Article 9, Number 2.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will not assign consecutive multiple coverage, during the same<br/>period, to avoid paying compensation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the responsibility of the teacher to complete, and turn in to the<br/>office, a &quot;Prep-Period Compensation Form,&quot; documenting the classroom coverage that<br/>is subject to the monetary compensation in this policy. Such form will be available in the<br/>high school office, and must be completed and turned in within five working days. There<br/>will be no compensation if the form is turned in after five working days have elapsed.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for classroom coverage in this policy will be paid monthly<br/>as bonuses.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the uniqueness of the class schedule in alternative education<br/>programs, this policy does not apply to the certificated staff at Granada High School.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>9. If, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, there is a need to modify the<br/>language of this policy, it may do so, after consultation with the teaching staff.</p>
<p>The District &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may elect to buy-out the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;period of any teacher, with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his/her</p>
<p>consent, to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach on a regular basis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during his or her preparation period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such</p>
<p>instances the District will pay a pro-rated salary equivalent to a percent of the teacher’s<br/>daily rate of pay determined by the number of periods in the bell schedule. For example,<br/>the percentage for a seven period day will be 1/7, or 14.3%. A 4 period day would be<br/>25%, 5 period day will be 20%, 6 period day would be 16.7%, etc. This compensation will<br/>be paid on the teacher’s regular monthly check..</p>
<p>The base teacher work year shall be comprised of 185 days, of which 180 will be student<br/>contact days.</p>
<p>The District &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will provide a draft school&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calendar to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Association at least 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days in</p>
<p>advance of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adoption by the Governing Board to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow the Association time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to give</p>
<p>feedback to the District.</p>
<p>Administrators will make every effort to give employees at least forty-eight hours notice<br/>prior to scheduling a mandatory staff meeting.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10<br/>SALARY</p>
<p>Effective with the August 2007 payroll, the salary schedule will be the schedule<br/>contained in Appendix “A.”</p>
<p>A certificated employee shall not move a step on the salary schedule if his or her most<br/>recent evaluation contains a rating of unsatisfactory and a three member panel<br/>composed of a teacher selected by the Association, an administrator who is not the<br/>employee’s evaluator, and a department chair mutually selected by the association and<br/>the superintendent agree by majority vote with the unsatisfactory rating.</p>
<p>A certificated employee shall not move a step on the salary schedule if he or she fails to<br/>complete either three semester units of college work from an accredited college or<br/>university or 54 District hours of inservice or workshops. One semester unit equals 18<br/>District hours. To receive credit for District hours a card describing the<br/>inservice/workshop attended and its benefit to the District must be approved by the<br/>Superintendent and Principal. An employee who has completed the required units or<br/>hours within the three year time period, but fails to turn in the paperwork by August 1<br/>shall not advance a salary step for the following school year but shall be entitled to<br/>make up that step the next subsequent school year so long as the employee turns in the<br/>required paperwork.</p>
<p>Only approved college credits may be used for salary schedule advancement across<br/>columns.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>Employees may receive a maximum of four (4) years credit on the salary schedule for<br/>service in another school district, except the Superintendent may grant additional years<br/>of credit in his or her discretion if deemed necessary for recruitment purposes.</p>
<p>Extra duty stipends shall be paid according to the schedule attached as Appendix E.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11<br/>ADJUNCT DUTIES</p>
<p>Adjunct duties are duties which a certificated employee is required to perform which<br/>generally occur outside the duty day at an extracurricular event. Class advising is also<br/>an adjunct duty. Class advising is assigned by grade level, except for special education<br/>students. The method of assignment may be changed by mutual agreement between<br/>the District and Association. Other adjunct duties are assigned as follows:</p>
<p>The District shall publish a list of adjunct duties which the District needs to have<br/>performed by certificated employees for the upcoming school year. This information will<br/>be given to the Association on or before the first faculty staff meeting of the new school<br/>year.</p>
<p>Certificated employees shall sign up for adjunct duties by seniority. On the first day on<br/>which adjunct duties are chosen, employees shall select 50 percent of the total duties<br/>on a duty roster provided by the principal. If taking 50 percent of the total duties creates<br/>a fractional number then the number of sign ups on the initial day is rounded up. For<br/>example: If the total number of duties per employee is 5, and 50 percent equals 2.5,<br/>then each employee shall sign up for 3 duties. On the second day, employees shall<br/>sign up for the remainder of the duties by seniority. An employee who cannot physically<br/>be present may submit his or her choices by proxy through an Association officer.</p>
<p>Selection of adjunct duties must be completed before the first instructional day.</p>
<p>If a certificated employee’s duties consist of running the clock at basketball games, the<br/>employee shall be exempted from doing campus supervision. (Clock duties will be no<br/>more than the number of adjunct duties assigned to each employee.)</p>
<p>If the need for additional adjunct duties arises after the first instructional day, the District<br/>will assign the duties from a prioritized list of employees provided by the Association.</p>
<p>If there is a change in date of any adjunct duty, the principal will give timely notice to the<br/>affected employee.</p>
<p>It is the certificated employee’s responsibility to arrange for coverage of an adjunct duty<br/>he or she cannot fulfill or swap duties with another employee.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Tournaments and playoffs will not be assigned as adjunct duties. Volunteers will be<br/>solicited for playoff games and if the number is insufficient, then an employee will be<br/>assigned with 48 hours notice.</p>
<p>Certificated employees shall not be required to perform adjunct duties during nutrition<br/>breaks and on days which fall outside the contractual work year (i.e. summer recess.)</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12<br/>SAVINGS</p>
<p>If any provision of this Agreement or any application of this Agreement to any employee<br/>is held to be contrary to law by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such provision or<br/>application shall be deemed invalid, except to the extent permitted by law. All other<br/>provisions or applications shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 13<br/>EARLY RETIREMENT</p>
<p>The District at its option may offer early retirement incentives to individual employees<br/>with the approval of the Association. The decision as to whether to offer a retirement<br/>incentive is within the sole discretion of the District and shall not be subject to the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 14<br/>ASSOCIATION RIGHTS</p>
<p>The Association may communicate with its members through the employees’ school<br/>mailboxes and by placing notices on an employee bulletin board to be located at a<br/>designated position at each school site.</p>
<p>As the District email system is to be used for business purposes only pursuant to BP<br/>and AR 4040, it shall not be used by the Association or any employee for Association-<br/>related communications.</p>
<p>The Association shall have a right of access to District equipment and facilities but only<br/>to the extent that the Association is entitled to such access under State law. The<br/>Association shall be required to notify the Superintendent in advance of any proposed<br/>use of school facilities or equipment and receive his or her prior approval. The<br/>Association shall be charged a reasonable fee for use of District supplies. Use of<br/>District facilities or equipment shall occur outside of the regular teacher workday.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>The District will respond to Association requests for information pertaining to items<br/>within the scope of bargaining as quickly as possible but no later than 10 work days<br/>after the request has been submitted.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 15<br/>DISTRICT RIGHTS</p>
<p>The District reserves all its management rights except as specifically limited under the<br/>terms of the Agreement. In particular and without limitation, the District shall have the<br/>right to assign teaching personnel to duties that serve the best interests of the District,<br/>the right to determine the kinds and levels of services to be provided and the means<br/>and methods of providing them, the right to determine the times and hours of District<br/>operation, and the right to determine curriculum and to establish educational policies,<br/>goals, and objectives. The District shall also have the right to contract out for<br/>certificated services.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 16<br/>HEALTH BENEFITS</p>
<p>The District shall provide four health and welfare benefit plans for its certificated<br/>employees. Plan “A” is the premier district plan with the highest premium cost. Plan “B”<br/>is the next best plan, with a lower premium cost than Plan “A.” Plan “C” is the lowest<br/>paid premium plan. Plan “C” will be the fully paid plan for retirees qualifying for lifetime<br/>health benefits under existing Board Policy No. 4154 and Plan “D” a high deductible<br/>plan for those who have double coverage. The health and welfare benefit plans are<br/>described in Appendix B. The list of eligible retirees is contained in Appendix “F.”</p>
<p>The District’s per employee contribution to the premium payment for the health and<br/>welfare benefit plan(s) shall be capped at $10,665.40.</p>
<p>The Association supports participation with a district “Health Benefit Plan Committee”<br/>comprised of retired and active classified, administrative, management and certificated<br/>employees. Such committee will meet a minimum of twice per year to study and make<br/>recommendations regarding plan design options and rates which are non-binding on<br/>any of the parties or the District.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>ARTICLE 17</p>
<p>DRESS CODE</p>
<p>In order to serve as role models for students and contribute to a productive learning<br/>environment, certificated employees shall maintain appropriate dress and grooming.<br/>Certificated employees shall wear clothing which demonstrates a high regard for<br/>education and presents an image consistent with job responsibilities. Clothing<br/>appropriate for a physical education teacher may not be appropriate for a classroom<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 18<br/>DRUG TESTING</p>
<p>The District may require a certificated employee to submit to drug or alcohol testing by a<br/>certified laboratory or other certified operator if the Superintendent or site principal<br/>reasonably suspects that the employee is currently under the influence of alcohol or<br/>drugs while on duty.</p>
<p>An employee may avoid the testing by providing evidence to the Superintendent that he<br/>or she is on prescription medication and agreeing to a fitness for duty examination by an<br/>employee-selected physician. If there is a recurrence of the behavior which led to the<br/>testing, the employee may, at the District’s option, either be tested or sent to a fitness<br/>for duty examination by a District-selected physician.</p>
<p>This Article will only be effective if the Governing Board adopts a policy applying the<br/>provisions of this Article to all administrators.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 19<br/>MERIT AWARDS</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee may issue to certificated employees service pins,<br/>certificates, plaques or other mementos in accordance with Board policy and<br/>administrative regulations.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee may also issue merit awards in accordance with<br/>Education Code section 44015 to certificated employees who:</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Propose ideas or procedures which eliminate or reduce district<br/>expenditures or improve district operations</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform special acts or services in the public interest</p>
