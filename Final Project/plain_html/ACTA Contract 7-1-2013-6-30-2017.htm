<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>A &quot;grievance&quot; is a formal written allegation by a grievant that a specific<br/>provision in the contract has been misinterpreted, misapplied, or violated.</p>
<p>A &quot;grievant&quot; may be any certificated non-management employee(s) of the<br/>District, including the Association or representatives thereof, covered by the terms<br/>of this Agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Immediate Supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having<br/>immediate jurisdiction over the grievant who has been designated to adjust<br/>grievances.</p>
<p>A &quot;day&quot; is any day, which is a workday (consistent with this contract) for the<br/>involved unit member.</p>
<p>8.2 Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant should attempt to<br/>resolve a problem through an informal conference with immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>8.3 Formal Level</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: If the grievance is not resolved at the Informal Level, the<br/>grievant must present the grievance in writing on the appropriate form to the<br/>immediate supervisor within twenty (20) days of when the grievant knew or<br/>reasonably should have known of the occurrence of the act or omission giving<br/>rise to the grievance.</p>
<p>This statement shall be a clear, concise account of the grievance, the<br/>circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the informal conference, and the<br/>specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall communicate decision to the grievant in writing<br/>within ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does not<br/>respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>Within the above time limits either the grievant or the supervisor may<br/>request another personal conference on the grievance.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: If a grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level<br/>One, the grievant may within ten (10) days appeal the decision in writing to the<br/>Superintendent or their management designee.</p>

<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: If a grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level<br/>Two, or if no written response has been received within twenty (20) days after<br/>receipt of the grievance by the Superintendent or designee, the grievant may<br/>within twenty (20) days after receipt of the decision or expiration of the<br/>Superintendent or designee’s time to communicate a decision, request in<br/>writing that the Superintendent or designee submit the grievance to arbitration.<br/>If any question arises as to whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction, such questions<br/>will be ruled upon by the arbitrator only after an opportunity to hear the merits of<br/>the grievance. If the Association chooses to ask for an arbitrator, the Association<br/>and the District shall attempt to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator. If no<br/>agreement can be reached, they shall request the State of California Mediation<br/>and Conciliation Service to supply a panel of five (5) persons experience in<br/>hearing grievances in public schools.

<p>All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of<br/>a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the<br/>personnel file of any of the participants. No reprisals of any kind will be<br/>taken by the Superintendent or by any member or representative of the<br/>administration or the Board of Trustees against any aggrieved person, any<br/>member of the Association or any other participant in the grievance procedure by<br/>reason of such participation.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 10: EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>Evaluation Procedures - Probationarv/Permanent Basis</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy on Evaluation of School District Personnel. The Cascade Union<br/>Elementary School District believes that the evaluation of all aspects of an<br/>educational program is necessary to the program’s success. A prime concern of<br/>such a procedure is the evaluation of the District’s certificated personnel which<br/>involves:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A planned program to keep certificated personnel informed of respective<br/>strengths and weaknesses and of options and resources for appropriate<br/>professional growth activities to meet identified needs.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A program to encourage and support certificated employees to continue to<br/>make conscious organized efforts to improve professional competence, thus<br/>guaranteeing that each student will continue to benefit from the service of<br/>professionals who constantly strive to maintain the highest possible standards.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A means for cooperative development of mutually understood standards and<br/>criteria for professional service and student growth.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A method of monitoring and supporting employee success and insuring that<br/>only capable, qualified, certificated employees achieve and retain permanent<br/>status.</p>
<p>The Cascade Union Elementary School District expects the evaluation of<br/>personnel to be positive in nature. Those responsible for personnel evaluations<br/>are expected to follow orderly methods of identifying strengths and/or<br/>weaknesses by using the agreed upon evaluation system. Evaluators are also<br/>expected to extend assistance for remediation of deficiencies, and to maintain<br/>accurate and impartial records as outlined in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement of Cascade Union Elementary School District</p>
<p>The District recognizes that, in the process of education, the uniqueness and<br/>individuality of the learner must be respected. Therefore, learning experiences<br/>must be matched to readiness and learning styles and directed toward successful<br/>performance, which will enhance the self-image of the learner. With this in mind,<br/>the District believes that the fundamental goal of the educational program is to<br/>provide students with skills and knowledge so they can function effectively, both<br/>in school and society, at a level consistent with their potential and to help students<br/>develop confidence in their own abilities.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidelines and Procedures</p>
<p>The District recognizes the teacher as the primary agent of the educational<br/>program and reaffirms the concept that the role of all other certificated employees<br/>of the district is one of providing support and assistance to the teacher in order to</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>facilitate the success of the instructional program.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher</p>
<p>The responsibility for evaluating each teacher shall rest with the site administrator<br/>in the building in which the teacher serves. The evaluation shall conform to this<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Certificated Personnel</p>
<p>When a certificated employee, such as a speech therapist, librarian, nurse or<br/>psychologist, works under more than one (1) administrator, the District<br/>Superintendent shall designate the primary evaluator and the other evaluators<br/>who shall assist the primary evaluator. The evaluation shall conform to this<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>• Quality of the Evaluation Program</p>
<p>The District Superintendent shall be responsible for the quality of the evaluation<br/>program, i.e. training of evaluators, etc.</p>
<p>10.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Certificated Personnel</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Board of Education to establish a useful system of evaluation<br/>of performance that is consistently applied to all certificated personnel. This<br/>system of evaluation should help certificated personnel improve the success of<br/>the instructional program.</p>
<p>The purpose of such an evaluation system shall be to improve the instructional<br/>program. It shall also be the purpose of the system to recognize and support<br/>professional excellence of the certificated staff.</p>
<p>An Evaluation Advisory Committee comprised of teachers and administrators<br/>shall be established to make recommendations to ensure consistency with the<br/>goals and purposes of the evaluation procedure. Teacher members shall be<br/>appointed by the Association. It will be the responsibility of this committee to<br/>monitor the evaluation procedure to determine if it is being appropriately<br/>conducted, where improvements can be made, what problems may arise, what<br/>adjustments may be necessary, and to what extent these procedures support<br/>efforts to improve the instructional program. This Committee will be advisory to<br/>the District and to the Association. It shall not be the responsibility of the Advisory<br/>Committee to review the evaluation of individual employees.</p>

<p>10.3.3 Goals Setting Conference</p>
<p>Inservice orientation in the use of this evaluation procedure will be carried out by<br/>the employee’s immediate supervisor in the orientation meeting at the beginning<br/>of the school year.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Goal Setting Conference is to provide an opportunity for a<br/>conversation about good teaching as reflected in the California Standards of the<br/>Teaching Profession and to establish an evaluation focus. In addressing the six<br/>standards the evaluator and evaluatee will collaboratively select up to three<br/>standards as specific areas of focus. However, in the evaluation process<br/>evaluatee is responsible for basic performance in all six standards.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging &amp; Supporting All Students in Learning</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Instruction &amp; Designing Learning Experiences for All Students</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating &amp; Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing Student Learning</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding &amp; Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing As A Professional Educator</p>
<p>The evaluatee shall indicate the areas of student outcomes using a standardized<br/>format. Failure to agree upon the objectives and/or the areas of student<br/>outcomes will result in a conflict, which will be submitted to a review panel. A<br/>written report, consisting of the Goals and written attachments, shall be submitted<br/>to the panel within six (6) days.</p>
<p>The Review Panel shall be composed of three (3) certificated employees working<br/>within the school district. One panel member shall be selected by the evaluatee,<br/>one by the evaluator, and one shall be mutually agreed upon by the two persons<br/>selected by the evaluator and the evaluatee. These three people must be<br/>selected, meet and make their recommendations in writing to the parties<br/>concerned within five (5) days of receipt of the Goals attachments.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Review Panel shall be to make recommendations regarding<br/>only those areas requiring mutual agreement between the evaluator and the<br/>evaluatee during the Goals Setting Conference and/or the Goals Update<br/>Conference. The recommendation of the Panel shall be advisory and are not<br/>intended to in any way supplant or circumvent the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>If the recommendations of the Panel are not acceptable to the evaluatee, the<br/>evaluatee or the evaluator may, within five (5) days, appeal the decision to the<br/>Superintendent. The Superintendent will render a decision within five (5) days,<br/>and the decision will be binding.</p>
<p>10.3.4 Final Evaluation Conference</p>
<p>Prior to March 15 for probationary employees or April 30 for permanent<br/>employees, the evaluator will meet with the evaluatee to review the performance<br/>of those duties included in the aforementioned areas of The California Standards<br/>of the Teaching Profession. The evaluatee will receive at least one week notice<br/>prior to the conference, and will bring adequate materials necessary to illustrate<br/>performance in terms of the established goals. The evaluator shall present a<br/>summary of teacher performance, and any recommendations or commendations<br/>the evaluator has made will be entered on the Summary Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>A written Summary Evaluation Report may be presented to the evaluatee at this<br/>conference or within seven (7) days of the conference, but prior to March 15 for<br/>probationary employees or April 30 for permanent employees. The Summary<br/>Evaluation Report shall be based on the procedures specified in this evaluation<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>In addition to the Goals Conference, at least two scheduled observations of<br/>probationary employees, with pre-and post-conferences, will be made prior to the</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>final Evaluation Conference. No scheduled or unscheduled formal observations<br/>shall be made prior to the Goals Conference.</p>
<p>At least one scheduled observation of permanent employees will be made before<br/>the evaluation conference. Permanent employees will be evaluated at least every<br/>other year.</p>
<p>Unscheduled observations may occur as the evaluator sees the need, or at the<br/>request of the evaluatee, throughout the school year. If an unscheduled<br/>observation is made for the purpose of evaluation, it will be followed up within two</p>
<p>(2) days if possible with a post-observation conference and a written report.</p>
<p>Consistent with the stated purposes of this evaluation procedure, all evaluation<br/>observations shall be for the purpose of improving the instructional program.</p>
<p>The evaluatee shall have the right to initiate a written response to the evaluation.<br/>Such response shall become a permanent attachment to the evaluatee’s<br/>personnel file, unless the evaluatee chooses at a later time to remove it.</p>
<p>10.4 Unsatisfactory Evaluation</p>
<p>An unsatisfactory evaluation is defined as a Summary Evaluation Report, which<br/>contains an unsatisfactory rating in any Standard A through F. An unsatisfactory<br/>rating in A through F must be accompanied by evidence as indicated on the<br/>Teaching Standards Rubric. In order for a standards to be rated unsatisfactory,<br/>there must be two or more domains rated unsatisfactory in that standard.</p>
<p>The Summary Evaluation Report containing an unsatisfactory rating for any<br/>Standard A through F will lead to a jointly developed improvement plan with<br/>continuous support to assist the employee in becoming successful. When a<br/>Standard is rated with an unsatisfactory category, multiple conferences will be<br/>held in order to facilitate the improvement plan. The Evaluation Improvement<br/>Plan will include recommendations and suggested options. These options may<br/>include, but not be limited to, district supported staff development, classroom<br/>visitations, subject area conferences, modeling by experiences educators and<br/>appropriate coursework. It will be the evaluator’s responsibility to develop an<br/>improvement plan within twenty (20) days of the final evaluation conference.</p>
<p>Evaluation of a permanent certificated employee on an improvement program will<br/>continue until the employee is successful or is separated. However, the evaluator<br/>shall stipulate the conditions which are to be met in order for the evaluatee’s<br/>performance to be considered proficient.</p>
