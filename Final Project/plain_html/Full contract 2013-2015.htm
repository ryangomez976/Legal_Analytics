<p>ARTICLE 1. Agreement</p>
<p>l.l.Term of Agreement. This Agreement between the Fallbrook Union Elementary School<br/>District, hereinafter &quot;District,&quot; and the Fallbrook Elementary Teachers Association,<br/>CTA/NEA, hereinafter &quot;Association,&quot; shall remain in full force and effect up to and<br/>including June 30, 2015 and thereafter shall continue in effect through June 30, year by year<br/>unless one of the parties notifies the other in writing no later than May 1, of the year in which<br/>the contract is to expire of its request to modify, amend or terminate the Agreement. In the<br/>event of this notification, negotiations shall commence after the Public Notice Provision of<br/>the Educational Employment Relations Act and the Public Employment Relations Board<br/>have been followed, and also after the District's income for the following year is known.</p>
<p>Reopener negotiations for 2014-15 school year are limited to total compensation (Article 11.<br/>Salaries and Fringe Benefits) and Article 5: Certificated Employee Evaluation.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition. The parties of this Agreement acknowledge that the Association is the<br/>exclusive bargaining representative for all regular, full-time contractual certificated<br/>employees of the District, excluding substitute, management, confidential and<br/>supervisory employees.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equal Application. The District’s implementation of this Agreement shall be uniform in<br/>application and effect. This provision shall not be construed to place constraints on<br/>individual school autonomy consistent with past practice.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2. Grievance and Arbitration Procedures</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is an allegation that one (or more) unit members has been<br/>adversely affected by a violation, misapplication and/or misinterpretation of an<br/>express term of the Agreement. All other matters and disputes of any nature are<br/>beyond the scope of these procedures and those matters so indicated elsewhere in<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent in all cases shall be the District itself rather than the individual.<br/>The filing or pendency of a grievance shall not delay or interfere with<br/>implementation of any District action during the processing thereof.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level. Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall make a<br/>reasonable attempt to resolve it by means of an informal conference with his/her<br/>immediate administrator. Both the grievant and the immediate administrator shall be<br/>entitled to be accompanied by a conferee at this informal conference. However, said<br/>conferee(s) may not participate in the conference between the parties unless specifically<br/>invited in writing to do so by the grievant and the immediate administrator. <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>2.3.3 Level 3, Mediator</p>
<p>2.3.3.1 In the event that the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>2, the grievant may request that the matter be submitted to mediation.<br/>The Association shall notify the Superintendent of its decision to<br/>submit the matter to mediation within twenty (20) school days of the<br/>Level 2 decision.</p>
<p>2.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California State Mediation and Conciliation Service (CSMCS)<br/>shall be asked to appoint a mediator. The mediator shall conduct a<br/>hearing and offer such recommendations as appropriate.</p>
<p>2.3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall notice the grievant within twenty (20) school<br/>days following the Level 3 hearing of any modification to the Level 2<br/>decision.</p>
<p>2.4 Level 4, Arbitration</p>
<p>2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances which are not settled at Level 3, and which the Association desires<br/>to contest further, shall be submitted to binding arbitration as provided herein,<br/>but only if the Association gives written notice to the District of its desires to<br/>arbitrate the grievance within twenty (20) school days after the termination of<br/>Level 3. It is expressly understood that the only matters, which are subject to<br/>binding arbitration, are grievances as defined above which were processed and<br/>handled in accordance with the limitations and procedures of this Article.<br/>Processing and discussing the merits of an alleged grievance by the District<br/>shall not constitute a waiver by the District of a defense that the dispute is not<br/>grievable. Arbitration proceedings will be conducted pursuant to the<br/>voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the .American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of Arbitrator. As soon as possible and in any event not later than<br/>ten (10) school days after the District receives the written notice of the<br/>Association's desire to arbitrate, the parties shall attempt to agree upon an<br/>arbitrator. If no agreement is reached within ten (10) days, an arbitrator shall<br/>be selected from a panel of arbitrators provided by the California State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Services (CSMCS) by each party alternately<br/>striking a name until one name remains.</p>
<p>2.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party who first strikes a name from the panel provided by the CSMCS<br/>shall be determined by lot. If the arbitrator selected indicates that he will not<br/>be available for hearing within a reasonable time not exceeding sixty (60)<br/>days, the parties shall proceed to select another arbitrator from the CSMCS<br/>list.</p>
<p>2.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motions to Dismiss. If the District claims that a grievance should be<br/>dismissed because, for example, it falls outside the scope of the procedure, or<br/>was filed or processed in an untimely manner, or that the dispute has become<br/>moot, or that a party has breached the confidentiality provisions, such a claim<br/>shall, at the option of the District, and without prejudice, be heard and ruled<br/>upon before hearing the merits of the case. If the arbitrator rules that the</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>claim is grievable under this Article, the parties may elect, by mutual<br/>agreement, to return the grievance to Level 2 of this procedure for further<br/>processing, and prior to a final decision being rendered by the arbitrator on the<br/>merits of the grievance. In such instances a suitable stay/continuance between<br/>such a grievability ruling and any further proceedings shall be granted as may<br/>be reasonably necessary.</p>
<p>2.4.5 Limitations Upon Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have no power to alter,<br/>amend, change, add to, or subtract from any of the terms of the Agreement,<br/>but shall determine only whether or not there has been a violation,<br/>misapplication or misinterpretation of this Agreement, in the request alleged<br/>in the grievance, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The decision of<br/>the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented<br/>to him by the respective parties in the presence of each other and upon<br/>arguments presented in written briefs.</p>
<p>2.4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not have authority, nor shall he consider it his<br/>function to decide any issue not submitted or to so interpret or<br/>apply the Agreement as to change that can be fairly said to have<br/>been the intent of the parties as determined by generally accepted<br/>rules of contract construction.</p>
<p>2.4.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not render any decision or award merely<br/>because in his opinion such decision or award is fair or equitable.</p>
<p>2.4.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to render an award on any<br/>grievance occurring before or after the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.4.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator may hear and determine only one (1) grievance at a<br/>time unless the District expressly agrees otherwise. However, both<br/>parties will in good faith endeavor to handle in an expeditious and<br/>convenient manner cases, which involve the same or similar facts<br/>and issues.</p>
<p>2.4.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parties cannot agree on a submission agreement, the<br/>arbitrator shall determine the issue(s) by referring to the written<br/>grievance, the answers thereto at each level, and the terms of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>2.4.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any<br/>decision, which requires the commission of an act, prohibited by<br/>law, or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement or the<br/>laws of state and federal government.</p>
<p>2.4.6 Arbitrator's Decision. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the</p>
<p>arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth the finding of fact,<br/>reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>2.4.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator within the limits herein prescribed<br/>shall be final and binding on the parties</p>
<p>2.4.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases the grievance and arbitration procedure described<br/>above is to be the Association's and unit members' sole and final<br/>remedy for any claimed breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenses. All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by<br/>the parties. Each party shall bear the expenses of the presentation of its own<br/>case. By mutual agreement, the parties may use the Expedited Arbitration<br/>Procedures of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>2.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to Meet Time Limits. If a grievance is not processed by the grievant<br/>and Association in accordance with the time limits set forth in this Article, it<br/>shall not be subject to arbitration and shall be considered settled on the basis<br/>of the decision last made by the District. If the District fails to respond to the<br/>grievance in a timely manner at any level, the running of its time limit shall be<br/>deemed a denial of the grievance and termination of the level involved, and<br/>the grievant may proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>2.4.8.1 Time limits hereunder may be lengthened or shortened in any</p>
<p>particular case only by mutual written agreement. The parties will<br/>attempt in good faith to adjust time limit problems, which occur<br/>above Level 1 as a result of the summer recess.</p>
<p>Provisions Relating to These Procedures</p>
<p>2.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Representation. The grievant shall be entitled upon request to<br/>representation by the Association at all grievance meetings as provided for in<br/>this Article. In situations where the Association has not been invited to<br/>represent the grievant, the District shall not agree to a final resolution of the<br/>grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the<br/>proposed resolution and has given the opportunity to state its views on the<br/>matter. The District will not agree to final resolution that is inconsistent with<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable Released Time. Grievance meetings normally will be scheduled<br/>by the District so as not to conflict with student services.</p>
<p>2.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality. In order to encourage a professional and harmonious<br/>disposition of unit members' complaints, it is agreed that from the time a<br/>grievance is filed until it is processed through arbitration, neither the grievant<br/>nor the Association nor the District shall make public pronouncements<br/>regarding either the grievance or evidence regarding the grievance.</p>
<p>2.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Reprisal. There shall be no reprisal against a unit member for filing a</p>
<p>grievance or assisting a grievant in the above procedures.</p>
<p>2.5.5 Grievance Files. The District's records developed for the filing and processing<br/>of a grievance shall be maintained separately from the grievant's personnel file.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3. Organizational Security</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Dues or Fees and Payroll Deductions</p>
<p>3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll Deduction. Any employee who is a member of the Association, or<br/>who has applied for membership, may sign and deliver to the Governing<br/>Board an assignment authorizing payroll deduction of membership dues.</p>
<p>Such authorization shall continue in effect from year to year unless revoked in<br/>writing between June 1 and September 1 of any year. Pursuant to such<br/>authorization, the Governing Board shall deduct one-tenth of such dues from<br/>the regular salary check of the employee each month for ten (10) months.<br/>Deductions for employees who sign such authorization after the<br/>commencement of the school year shall be appropriately prorated to complete<br/>payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Member Options</p>
<p>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who is not a member of the Association or who does not make<br/>application for membership within thirty (30) days from the date of<br/>commencement of duties shall become a member of the Association or pay to<br/>the Association a representational fee in amount equal to membership dues,<br/>payable to the Association, provided, however, that the employee may<br/>authorize payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as provided in</p>
<p>3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this Article.</p>
<p>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets<br/>and teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee<br/>organizations shall not be required to join or financially support<br/>FETA/CTA/NEA as a condition of employment pursuant to Government<br/>Code section 3546.3. Such employee shall pay in lieu of a service fee sums<br/>equal to such service fee to one of the following non-religious, non-labor<br/>organization charitable funds exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of<br/>Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code:</p>
<p>3.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation to Assist California&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers (FACT)</p>

<p>3.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys/Girls Club of Fallbrook Foundation</p>
<p>3.2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casa de Amparo</p>
<p>This amount shall annually be paid in full within thirty (30) day of the<br/>commencement of duties or by monthly payments that are equivalent to the<br/>monthly FETA Unified dues. Proof of payment and a written statement of</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>objection along with verifiable evidence of membership in a religious body<br/>whose traditional tenets of teaching object to joining or financially supporting<br/>employee organizations, shall be made on an annual basis to the Association<br/>or on or before November 1 of each year. Proof of payment shall be in the<br/>form or receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of<br/>payment and to whom payment has been made.</p>
<p>3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee electing the option provided for in Section 3.2.2 above shall be<br/>responsible for providing the Association with proof of said payment. Failure<br/>to do so shall allow the Association to submit a written request that the<br/>employee be terminated from District employment for failure to satisfactorily<br/>comply with a non-member option as provided for herein.</p>
<p>3.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such employee who hold conscientious objections pursuant to 3.2.1 requests<br/>the employee organization to use the grievance procedure or arbitration<br/>procedure on the employee's behalf, the Association is authorized to charge<br/>the employee for the reasonable cost of using such procedure.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deduction Procedures</p>
<p>3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to authorization by<br/>the employee for membership dues, the District accepts the responsibility for<br/>remitting such monies to the Association Treasurer, accompanied by an<br/>alphabetical list of employees for whom such deductions have been made and<br/>indicating any changes in personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>
<p>3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to<br/>fulfill the provisions of this Section.</p>
<p>3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who revokes his/her authorization for the payroll deduction of<br/>membership dues shall transmit such dues or fees to the FETA Treasurer, in<br/>conformity with the following payment schedule: In full or monthly, due no<br/>later than the 10th of the month. The Association President shall be notified<br/>by the District of all such revocations.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary Action for Noncompliance</p>
<p>3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the written request of the Association, individuals not complying with<br/>these provisions of this Article shall be subject to disciplinary action by the<br/>District, up to and including dismissal</p>
<p>3.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not under any circumstances risk the loss of employment<br/>because of a lack of good standing in the Association. The Association shall<br/>not cause the discharge of an employee who has resigned from, or has been<br/>expelled by the Association, for any reason other than their failure to tender<br/>the dues or service charge to the Association.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>3.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall indemnify and hold the District harmless from any and<br/>all claims, demands or suits or any other action arising from the organizational<br/>security provisions contained herein.</p>
<p>3.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any time during the duration of this Agreement the Association<br/>authorizes, causes, supports, engages in or sanctions any strike or work<br/>stoppage of any kind or pickets or if there is a refusal to perform the duties of<br/>employment by any employees, then this Article shall become null and void<br/>and inoperative during the balance of the school year in which said work<br/>stoppage may occur.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4. Leaves</p>
<p>4.1 Industrial Accident and Illness Leave. In addition to any other benefits that an</p>
<p>employee may be entitled to under the Worker's Compensation laws of this state,</p>
<p>employees shall be entitled to the following benefits:</p>
<p>4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee suffering an injury or illness arising out of and in the course and<br/>scope of his/her employment shall be entitled to a leave of not more than sixty<br/>(60) working days in any one (1) fiscal year for the same accident or illness.<br/>This leave shall not be accumulated from year to year, and when any leave<br/>will overlap a fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only that amount<br/>remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the injury or illness occurred.</p>
<p>4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>4.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment for wages lost on any day shall not, when added to an award granted<br/>the employee under the Worker's Compensation laws of this state, exceed the<br/>normal wage for the day.</p>
<p>4.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial accident or illness leave is to be used in lieu of nonnal sick<br/>leave benefits. When entitlement to industrial accident or illness leave under<br/>this Section has been exhausted, entitlement to other sick leave, vacation, or<br/>other paid leave may then be used. If, however, an employee is still receiving<br/>temporary disability payments under the Worker's Compensation laws of this<br/>state at the time of the exhaustion of benefits under this Section, he/she shall<br/>be entitled to use only so much of his/her accumulated and available normal<br/>sick leave and vacation leave, which, when added to the Worker's<br/>Compensation award, provides for a day's pay at the regular rate of pay.</p>
<p>4.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time an employee on industrial accident or illness leave is able to return<br/>to work, he/she shall be reinstated in his/her position without loss of pay or<br/>benefits.</p>
<p>8</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<p>4.1.7</p></td><td>
<p>Any employee receiving benefits as a result of this Section shall, during<br/>periods of injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless the<br/>Governing Board authorizes travel outside the state.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>4.1.8</p></td><td>
<p>An employee shall not be allowed to return to District service following an<br/>industrial accident or illness leave unless the District's Worker's<br/>Compensation physician states the employee is physically able to resume<br/>duties without limitation or impairment.</p></td></tr>

<p>A full-time employee shall be granted one (1) day per month of contractual<br/>District service for leaves of absence due to illness or injury. A part-year<br/>employee shall receive prorated sick leave in the same ratio as the months of<br/>service worked bears to a standard annual work calendar; for purposes of<br/>crediting a partial month of service for sick leave benefits, an employee must<br/>work half or more of the work days in said month. If the employee does not<br/>use the full amount of sick leave allowed in any year under this Section, the<br/>amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year. If an employee<br/>transfers to another school district, the entire accumulated sick leave shall be<br/>transferred with the employee according to the provisions of the Education<br/>Code.</p></td></tr>

The employee will<br/>select one standard and the evaluator will select one standard which will form<br/>the basis for the formal evaluation. In the year following an Ineffective<br/>evaluation, CSTP Standard 6 (six) may be selected by the employee as a third<br/>CSTP standard.</p>
<p>5.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessments/Key Elements. The unit member will be assessed as<br/>Does Not Meet Standards or Meets Standards with respect to each<br/>standard included in the evaluation. The unit member will not be<br/>assessed as Ineffective with respect to a standard unless half or more<br/>of the related key elements (see 5.2.2. above) are assessed as<br/>Ineffective.</p>

<p>18</p>
<p>5.5.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modification of Objectives. During the course of the evaluation<br/>period, circumstances may arise which in the opinion of the<br/>employee or the evaluator may require modification of the teacher’s<br/>objectives, as referred to in section 5.5.2 above.</p>

<p>5.6 Alternative Evaluation Process for Permanent Unit Members</p>
<p>5.6.1 Purpose. The alternative evaluation process encourages unit members to<br/>emphasize professional development and personal growth through the<br/>evaluation system. The process offers to unit members who have consistently<br/>demonstrated effective performance an alternative to the regular evaluation<br/>process. The process is flexible in order to encourage unit members to grow<br/>in self-chosen areas of interest that promote and relate to student learning and<br/>instructional leadership through individual or group efforts. In addition, the<br/>process allows for self-evaluation in collaboration with the evaluator. The<br/>goals, objectives, projects and criteria established under the alternative<br/>assessment process shall be aligned to and use the same forms as the regular<br/>evaluation. The process is structured to strengthen collegial relationships and<br/>cooperation and to decrease isolation.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>5.6.2 Evaluation Plan. Permanent unit members with a minimum of five years of<br/>effective certificated experience in the District may, with mutual agreement of<br/>the evaluator, elect to participate in the alternative evaluation process.</p>
<p>5.6.2.1 Pre-Evaluation Conference. At a pre-evaluation conference held in<br/>compliance with the time lines established in Section 5.5.2, the<br/>evaluatee(s) and the evaluator shall meet, discuss and mutually agree<br/>upon the evaluation plan, including constraints. Evaluatees and<br/>evaluators are encouraged to be creative and take risks when<br/>developing options. The evaluatee(s) and the evaluator will schedule<br/>evaluation updates throughout the assessment period.</p>
<p>S.6.2.2. Basic Requirements. While participating in the alternative</p>
<p>evaluation process, evaluatees continue to maintain responsibility for<br/>performance of basic job description requirements and Education<br/>Code requirements relating to progress of pupils toward district<br/>standards, use of appropriate instructional techniques and strategies,<br/>adherence to curricular objectives, establishment and maintenance of<br/>a suitable learning environment and performance of non-<br/>instructional duties and responsibilities including supervisory and<br/>advisory duties. Participation in this process assumes compliance<br/>with the requirements of the Education Code.</p>
<p>5.6.2.3 Final Evaluation. At the conclusion of the evaluation period, the<br/>evaluatee shall present to the evaluator the results of the agree-upon<br/>evaluation plan. The evaluator shall review the results and complete<br/>a summary evaluation form for inclusion in the evaluatee’s file.</p>

<p>BENEFIT HIGHLIGHTS FOR DELTA DENTAL PPO</p>
<p>Delta Dental offers you what no other dental plan can - The Delta Dental Dlfference<sup>SM</sup>. Here's what makes us a leading provider of<br/>dontal benefits:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptional Cost Savings - Our networks protect enrollees from balance billing and prevent dentists from charging more by<br/>“unbundling&quot; services that should be billed as one service. Your costs are usually lowest when you visit a Delta Dental dentist.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guaranteed Colnsurance/Copayment - Delta Dental dentists agree to accept our determination of fees. They won't balance<br/>bill over Delta Denial's approved amount.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Treatment Standards - Delta Dental reviews utilization patterns and office practices to ensure that Delta<br/>Dental dentists meet professional standards for safety and quality of care.</p>
<p>The Delta Dental PPO program allows you the freedom to visit any licensed denlist, including a dentist from our Delta Dental<br/>Premier® indemnity network. However, there are advantages to visiting a Delta Dental PPO network dentist Instead of a Premier or<br/>non-Delta Dental dentist. Consider the information below:</p>

<p>As a part of VEBA, you receive chiropractic benefits as long as you receive care from<br/>participating OptumHealth Physical Health of California (Optum) providers. Your benefits<br/>include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlimited visits (subject to medical necessity)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copays that align with your PCP office visit copay</p>

<p>Only Optum chiropractors are eligible for reimbursement under the plan. So, before you receive<br/>services, please verify that your chiropractor still participates with Optum.</p>
<p>THREE WAYS TO FIND A PROVIDER:</p>
<p>Your health plan coverage gives you access to more than 2,700 network providers in California.<br/>Here are three easy ways to find a contracted provider near you:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the Provider Locator search at <a href="http://www.mvoptumhealthphvsicalhealthofca.com">www.mvoptumhealthphvsicalhealthofca.com</a></p>
<p>a. To identify a participating provider, look for “VEBA” in the list in the column headed<br/>“Participating Provider for:”</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call Optum Member Services at 1-800-428-6637 (5 a.m. to 5 p.m., Pacific Time<br/>Monday-Friday) for the most current and up to date information.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call the provider directly to schedule an appointment, and verify they are part of the<br/>Optum network for VEBA.</p>
<p>How do my benefits work?</p>
<p>At the time of your appointment:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your provider will verify your eligibility using your Optum ID Card. Then, simply pay<br/>your designated copay. If you have misplaced your ID Card or don’t have one, you can<br/>still access services. Just tell your provider you are covered under VEBA, and they can<br/>verify your benefits with Optum.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your provider may also ask you to complete a Patient Summary form. This form makes it<br/>easy for you to share important information about your condition with your provider. It<br/>also helps them determine what type of treatment to provide so you can improve as<br/>quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Note: Most patients only complete this form once; but if your condition requires<br/>prolonged treatment, you may need to complete the form again with updated information.</p>
<p>$10 (Kaiser, Network 1)<br/>$20 (Network 2)</p>
<p>$30 (PPO in-network)</p>

<p>$30</p>
<p>$35</p>
<p>$40</p>
<p>$35 (Alliance)<br/>$40 (Network 3)</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your provider submits a Patient Summary Form information to Optum, you and<br/>your provider may receive a recovery milestone document, which represents a number of<br/>treatments within most patients with a similar condition have recovered.</p>
<p>Note: This is not an authorized number of treatments or a limit on the number of<br/>treatments available to you. It simply helps your provider to set a point when your<br/>condition should be reviewed again to determine the level of improvement you have<br/>made with the treatment you have already received.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need additional treatment, your provider will advise you and Optum.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS?</p>
<p>Call Optum Member Services at 1-800-428-6337 (5 a.m. to 5 p.m.. Pacific Time, Monday -<br/>Friday)</p>
