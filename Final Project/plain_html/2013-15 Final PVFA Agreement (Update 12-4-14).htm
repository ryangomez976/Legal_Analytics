<p>Notwithstanding the above, the parties agree to continue to meet and negotiate for the purpose of<br/>renumbering articles, sections and subsections of the collective bargaining agreement; removing obsolete<br/>or redundant language from the collective bargaining agreement; and adding missing language from<br/>previous agreements to the collective bargaining agreement. All additional revisions to the contract<br/>outside of this agreement must be ratified by the parties before implementation.</p>
<p>2-4 Notwithstanding the above, the District and the Association agree to reopen negotiations for</p>
<p>2014-15 on Compensation and Benefits (Article 7) and two other articles as selected by each party.</p>

<p>7</p>
<p>4-8.2 Any unit member who is not a member of the Association or who does not make an application<br/>for membership within thirty (30) days following the effective date of this paragraph (November<br/>5,1984), or, for those hired after the effective date of this paragraph, within thirty (30) days from<br/>the date of commencement of duties, shall become a member of the Association or pay to the<br/>Association a fee in the amount equal to that of the unified membership dues, initiation fees,<br/>and general assessments which are directly attributable to the Association's representation of<br/>the unit employees, provided, however, that the unit member may authorize payroll deduction<br/>for such fee in the same manner, as provided in Article 3.8 of this Agreement.</p>

Any fraction of a month shall be counted as a full month.</p>
<p>4-8.7 No unit member shall be required to join the Association or to make a service fee payment if the<br/>unit member is an actual verified member of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which has<br/>historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting employee<br/>organizations; this exemption shall not be granted unless and until such unit member has<br/>verified the specific circumstances. Such unit member must, instead, arrange with the<br/>Association to satisfy his/her obligation by donating the equivalent amount to a non-labor, non¬<br/>religious charitable fund, which is tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue<br/>Code chosen from the following list:</p>
<p>United Way, Heart Fund, Cancer Society, and the Peninsula Education Foundation.</p>

<p>8</p>
<p>4-8.8 The District shall not deduct money specifically earmarked for the Political Action Committee or<br/>the Association for Better Citizenship (ABC/PAC), or other political activities unless such<br/>deduction is affirmatively authorized in writing by the unit member.</p>
<p>4-8.9 The Association and/or its parent organization, CTA, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless<br/>from liability and pay all the legal fees and legal costs incurred in defending against any court<br/>action and/or administrative action before the Public Employment Relations Board challenging<br/>the legality or constitutionality of the service fee provision of this Agreement, or its<br/>implementation.</p>
<p>4-8.10 The parties agree that it is in their mutual interest for the District to seek input from the<br/>Association regarding topics that affect PVFA bargaining unit members. In that spirit, at least<br/>one bargaining unit member shall be provided an opportunity to serve on committees mutually<br/>established by the parties to address contract and/or instructional related matters. If committee<br/>meetings are scheduled during the workday, unit members shall be granted release time during<br/>their workday at no loss of pay or benefits, to fulfill the committee obligations.</p>
<p>4-8.11 In addition, at least one bargaining unit member shall be provided an opportunity to serve on<br/>District established interview panels as one part of the selection process for school/District<br/>administrators. This does not include interview panels consisting solely of Board of Education<br/>members and/or management employees. If interview panels are scheduled during the<br/>workday, unit members shall be granted release time at no loss of pay or benefits, to fulfill the<br/>obligations to the interview panel.</p>

<p>jointly developed forming the basis for the final evaluation. For purposes of<br/>this procedure, the words &quot;jointly develop&quot; mean a collaborative approach<br/>between the evaluator and evaluatee in defining reasonable plans, objectives,<br/>goals, and means of assessment. These goals and objectives may be revised<br/>during the course of the year pursuant to the above.</p>

<p>43</p>
<p>least seventy-five (75) percent of the salary agreed to in the contract signed with the outside<br/>district. A notarized affidavit shall be filed verifying this service.</p>
<p>13-13.8 Service on an exchange leave grants credit toward retirement. If retirement contributions are<br/>not deducted from compensation the employee must personally arrange for payment of<br/>required contributions.</p>
<p>13-13.9 Request for exchange leave shall be made on forms obtained from the Personnel Office. When<br/>completed, the forms shall be presented to the building principal for approval as to the<br/>replaceability of the employee.

<p>13-17.2.5 Leave from the bank may not be used for work-related illnesses or injuries<br/>which qualify the unit member for worker compensation benefits unless the<br/>unit member has exhausted all workers compensation leave under Article 13,<br/>#7.</p>
<p>13-17.3 Process for Settling Disputes</p>
<p>13-17.3.1 The District and the Association agree to establish a Catastrophic Leave<br/>Review Committee. The committee shall be comprised of five members, two<br/>appointed by the District and three appointed by PVFA. Any unit member<br/>dissatisfied with any action taken or decision made by the District, concerning<br/>the Catastrophic Leave plan herein provided, may appeal that action or<br/>decision to the review panel within ten (10) working days.

<p>No action taken by the District under this Section shall be subject to the<br/>grievance procedure of this agreement.</p>
<p>13-17.4 An employee who is suffering from a catastrophic injury or illness may not draw upon the leave<br/>bank until exhaustion of all paid illness and injury leave. Thereafter, donated leave from the<br/>leave bank shall be paid concurrently with substitute-differential pay, provided that the total daily<br/>compensation paid to the donee employee shall not exceed the donee employee's daily rate of<br/>pay were he actively employed.

No surrender and assignment<br/>shall be effective until approved by the Superintendent or his designee. The Superintendent<br/>shall have the final, unreviewable and sole discretion to approve or to disapprove a donation of<br/>sick leave. The decision of the Superintendent shall not be subject to the grievance procedure<br/>but may be reviewed by the District's Board of Education in accordance with the procedures set<br/>forth in Section 17.8 below.</p>
<p>13-17.7 An employee who has submitted a request to donate sick leave, and an employee who<br/>receives leave from the leave bank, shall each execute an agreement satisfactory to the<br/>District. The agreement will confirm the understanding of each that the donation of sick leave is<br/>voluntary. The agreement will also provide that each employee agrees to indemnify and hold<br/>the District harmless from any claims, demands, or causes of action related to the donation.</p>
<p>13-17.8 If any provision of Section 17 is held to be unlawful, then this entire section shall be null and<br/>void.</p>
<p>13-17.9 Section 17 supersedes any obligations of the District under Education Code Section 44043.5</p>
<p>13-18 Family and Medical Care</p>
<p>Pursuant to State and Federal law, the District will provide family and medical care leave for eligible<br/>employees. The following provisions set forth unit members' rights and obligations with respect to such<br/>leave rights and obligations which are not specifically set forth below, are set forth in the Department of<br/>Labor regulations implementing the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA&quot;) and the<br/>regulations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission implementing the California<br/>Family Rights Act (&quot;CFRA&quot;) (Government Code 12945.2) unless otherwise provided by this article.<br/>&quot;Leave&quot; under this article shall mean leave pursuant to the FMLA and CFRA.</p>
<p>13-18.1 Members Eligible for Leave</p>
<p>A member is eligible for leave if the member:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been employed for at least 12 months; and</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has actually worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 month period immediately<br/>preceding the commencement of the leave (full-time teachers who instruct students are<br/>presumed to meet this hours-worked requirement unless the District can show that the<br/>teacher did not actually work 1250 hours).</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>13-18.2 Reasons for Leave</p>
<p>Leave is only permitted for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the birth of a child, or to care for a newborn of a unit member within twelve (12) months<br/>of the birth;</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the placement of a child with a unit member in connection with the adoption or foster<br/>care of a child within twelve (12) months of the placement for adoption or foster care.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave to care for a child, parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition; or</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave because of a serious health condition that makes the member unable to perform<br/>the function of his/her position.</p>
<p>A &quot;serious health condition&quot; includes an illness, injury impairment, or physical or mental<br/>condition that involves:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with a hospital, hospice or<br/>residential medical care facility;</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, of more than three (3) calendar<br/>days that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health<br/>care provider; or</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuing treatment of a health care provider for a chronic or long term health<br/>condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period<br/>of incapacity of more than three (3) calendar days or for prenatal care.</p>
<p>&quot;Continuing treatments&quot; include:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two or more visits to a health care provider;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two or more treatments by a health care practitioner (e.g., physical therapist)<br/>on referral from, or under the direction of a health care provider; or</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a single visit to a health care provider that results in a regimen of continuing<br/>treatment under the supervision of the health care provider.</p>
<p>13-18.3 Amount of Leave</p>
<p>Eligible members are entitled to a total of 12 work weeks of leave during any 12 month period.<br/>A member's entitlement to leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care<br/>expires 12 months after the birth or placement. Except for pregnancy, FMLA and CFRA leave<br/>shall run concurrently. Pregnant unit members shall be entitled to twelve (12) workweeks of<br/>FMLA leave while disabled from the pregnancy, which shall run concurrently with Pregnancy<br/>Disability Leave Act (PDLA) leave, sick leave, and extended illness leave. Such unit members<br/>shall also be entitled to twelve (12) workweeks of CFRA leave to care for the child within twelve<br/>(12) months of the birth, such leave to be used once the member is no longer disabled due to<br/>pregnancy or entitlement to FMLA and PDLA leave ends, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>The 12 month period for calculating leave entitlement will be a &quot;rolling period&quot; measured<br/>forward from the date leave is taken and continues with each additional leave day taken.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>Leave under this article is unpaid except where it is running concurrently with other available<br/>paid leaves. In addition, while on leave, unit members will continue to be covered by the<br/>District’s medical, dental, and vision insurance. Unit members on such leave shall continue to<br/>be required to make any employee contributions to health benefits premiums as would be<br/>required if they were working. If a member on leave is unable to continue to make the premium<br/>contributions, health benefits will be discontinued while on family leave, but shall immediately<br/>resume upon return to work. Unit members will not be covered under the District’s other benefit<br/>plans while on family leave unless they make the appropriate contributions for continued<br/>coverage.</p>
<p>13-18.4 Member Benefits While on Leave</p>
<p>Leave under this article is unpaid. In addition, while on leave, members will continue to be<br/>covered by the District's medical, dental and vision insurance. However, members will not<br/>continue to be covered under the District's income protection and other benefit plans unless<br/>members make the appropriate contributions for continued coverage.</p>
<p>If a member fails to return to work after his/her leave entitlement has been exhausted or<br/>expires, the District shall have the right to recover its share of health plan premiums for the<br/>entire leave period, unless the unit member does not return to work for at least thirty (30)<br/>calendar days because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition<br/>which would entitle the member to leave, or other circumstances beyond the unit member’s<br/>control.</p>
<p>13-18.5 Use of Other Accrued Leaves While on Leave</p>
<p>Unpaid family leave pursuant to this section shall run concurrently with available paid leaves. If<br/>a unit member requests leave for any reason permitted in Section 13-18.2, he/she must<br/>exhaust all available paid leaves (except sick leave and extended illness leave) in connection<br/>with the family leave.</p>
<p>If a member requests leave for his/her own serious health condition, in addition to exhausting all<br/>available paid leaves, the unit member must also exhaust sick leave and extended illness<br/>leave.</p>
<p>13-18.6 Medical Certification</p>
<p>The District may require members who request leave to provide written certification from the<br/>health care provider of the individual requiring care. If the leave is requested because of the<br/>member's own serious health condition, the certification must include a statement that the<br/>member is unable to perform the essential functions of his/her position.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>If the District has reason to doubt the validity of a certification, the District may require a medical<br/>opinion of a second health care provider chosen by the District. If the second opinion is<br/>different from the first, the District may require the opinion of a third provider jointly approved by<br/>the District and the member. The opinion of the third provider will be binding.</p>
<p>13-18.7 Member Notice of Leave</p>
<p>Although the District recognizes that emergencies arise which may require unit members to<br/>request immediate leave, unit members are required to give as much notice as possible of their<br/>need for leave. If leave is foreseeable, at least thirty (30) days notice is required. In addition, if<br/>a member knows that he/she will need leave in the future, but does not know the exact date(s)<br/>(e.g., for the birth of a child or placement for adoption or foster care of a child or to take care of<br/>a newborn or a child placed for adoption or foster care), the unit member shall inform his/her<br/>supervisor as soon as possible that such leave will be needed. If the District determines that<br/>the unit member knew of the need for the requested leave at least thirty (30) days in advance of<br/>the request, the District may delay the granting of the leave for up to thirty (30) days from the<br/>date of the request until it can, at its discretion, adequately cover the position with a substitute.</p>
<p>13-18.8 Reinstatement Upon Return from Leave</p>
<p>Upon expiration of leave, a member is entitled to be restored to the position of employment held<br/>when the leave commenced, or to an equivalent or comparable position.</p>
<p>As a condition of restoration of a unit member whose leave was due to the member's own<br/>serious health condition, which made the member unable to perform his/her job, the unit<br/>member shall obtain and present a fitness-for-duty certification from a health care provider that<br/>the member is able to return to work. If the unit member has a disability protected by law, the<br/>fitness-for-duty certification may include work related restrictions and proposed reasonable<br/>accommodations, subject to anti-disability discrimination law requirements. Failure to provide<br/>such certification will result in denial of restoration.</p>
<p>13-18.9 Request for Leave</p>
<p>Member shall fill out the &quot;Request for Family or Medical Leave Form&quot; prepared by the District to<br/>be eligible for leave. This form will enable the District to satisfy its record keeping obligations.</p>
