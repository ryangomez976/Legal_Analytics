Evaluation of teacher performance must be a cooperative, continuing process<br/>designed to improve the quality of instruction. All certificated employees are involved in the evaluation<br/>process and all employees shall be evaluated according to law.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each evaluation shall be based upon at least one (1) classroom observation. It is the<br/>authority and responsibility of the evaluator to make observations when he/she deems<br/>necessary.

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the completion of the formal evaluation, a conference shall be scheduled<br/>between the teacher and administrator. At the conference, the evaluator will present the<br/>written evaluation and discuss its contents with the teacher. The teacher shall sign the<br/>evaluation form, signifying only that he/she has read the document and has been allowed<br/>an opportunity to attach a written response, if desired, which shall become a part of the<br/>permanent evaluation record.</p>

<p>For any days of absence as a result of an industrial accident, the unit member shall endorse to the<br/>District any wage loss benefit check from Workers' Compensation Insurance carrier, which would make<br/>the total compensation from both sources exceed 100% of the amount the unit member would have<br/>received as salary had there been no industrial accident or illness.

<p>(7) years. The application for and granting leaves of absence shall be in writing. In addition, a<br/>teacher on such leave shall notify the District Office by March 15 of the school year, as to an<br/>intention to return to employment in the District the following school year.

<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The District will continue to exercise good faith efforts to see that each bargaining unit member</p>
<p>receives his/her appropriate preparation time. Nevertheless, circumstances sometimes may require<br/>District administrators to request/assign a bargaining unit member to substitute teach during<br/>his/her preparation time or other portion of his/her duty day. Any bargaining unit member who so<br/>substitutes shall be compensated for such excess substitutions at the rate set forth in Exhibit B.</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The District will provide K-8 teachers no less than forty-five minutes per day preparation time and</p>
