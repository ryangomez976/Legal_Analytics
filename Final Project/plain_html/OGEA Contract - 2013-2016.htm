<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District And Unit Member Rights</p>
<p>The approval or denial of a leave of absence, except in cases where a<br/>leave of absence must be granted by specific provisions of law<br/>and/or this Agreement, shall be construed to be a right reserved by<br/>the District and the Governing Board. The exercise of discretion by<br/>the District or the Governing Board shall not constitute a grievance<br/>under the provisions of Article 7 of this Agreement, provided,<br/>however, nothing in this Section 8.1.1 shall deprive a unit member<br/>the right to pursue a grievance relating to a violation of any other<br/>provisions of this leave policy.</p>
<p>8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years Of Service For Salary Placement</p>
<p>If a unit member is on leave, whether paid or unpaid, for more than<br/>twenty-five percent (25%) of the school year, the unit member shall<br/>not be entitled to a year of service for salary placement purposes as<br/>provided in Section 12.4.5 of this Agreement. Provided, however,<br/>that the term ‘leave” in this Section does not include paid sick leave<br/>or paid leave taken in accordance with Section 8.6 of this<br/>Agreement. Both such leaves are considered days of service within<br/>the meaning of Section 12.4.5 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return To Work After A Leave</p>
<p>Unit members who are on paid or unpaid leave at the end of the<br/>school year shall notify the District in writing by April 15 of their<br/>intent to return to work at the beginning of the next school year. If<br/>a unit member notifies the District as required by this Section, the<br/>District shall return the unit member to the site where the unit<br/>member worked prior to the leave. A unit member may request<br/>additional leave or may request a change in the unit member’s<br/>employment status in any other manner. A unit member who is on<br/>leave at the end of the school year and who fails to give the District<br/>written notification as required by this Section shall not be<br/>guaranteed a return to the site where the unit member worked<br/>prior to the leave. The District and the Association agree to change<br/>“April 15” to “April 7” for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school<br/>years. The District and the Association agree to return to<br/>“April 15” for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 school years.</p>

<p>8.2 Sick Leave</p>
<p>The District provides for its regular, full-time unit members against the loss<br/>of income sustained because of illness.

Sick leave may be used<br/>for medical and dental appointments that cannot be scheduled outside the<br/>instructional day. Sick leave, personal necessity leave, or bereavement leave<br/>shall not be used to extend vacation periods, holidays, or to avoid attending<br/>staff development days.</p>

<p>“Parent” means a biological, foster, or adoptive<br/>parent, a stepparent, or a legal guardian.</p>

The sick leave described<br/>in Sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 and the five (5) month period described<br/>in Section 8.2.3 shall run consecutively. A unit member shall not be<br/>provided more than one five (5) month period per illness or<br/>accident. If a school year terminates before the five (5) month<br/>period is exhausted, however, the unit member may take the<br/>balance of the five (5) month period in a subsequent school year.<br/>The five (5) month period of “differential pay” days shall not count<br/>as days of service within the meaning of Section 12.4.5 of this<br/>Agreement.

<p>A unit member who is absent for one-half (1/2) day or less shall<br/>have deducted one-half (1/2) day from the available leave; and if the</p>

Probationary unit<br/>members shall be placed on the list for a period of twenty-four (24)<br/>months and permanent unit members shall be placed on the fist for<br/>a period of thirty-nine (39) months. When the unit member is<br/>medically able to return during the twenty-four (24) or thirty-nine<br/>(39) months, the District shall assign the unit member to a position<br/>for which the unit member is credentialed and qualified. If at the<br/>end of the twenty-four (24) or thirty-nine (39) month period, the<br/>unit member is unable to perform the duties, the unit member shall<br/>be dismissed.</p>

<p>8.3.1 Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>Personal necessity leave may only be taken for one of the following<br/>reasons:</p>

For the<br/>purpose of this Section, “matters of compelling personal<br/>importance” shall be defined as urgent personal business<br/>that, under the specific circumstances, a reasonable unit<br/>member would not disregard and that cannot be handled<br/>outside of the work day. Leave for “matters of compelling<br/>personal importance” shall not be used to avoid<br/>participation in staff development buy back days, parent<br/>conference days, or any other non-student attendance<br/>days. Unit members are discouraged from extending a<br/>holiday or vacation period by using leave for matters of<br/>compelling personal importance. Although a unit member<br/>is discouraged from taking leave for matters of compelling<br/>personal importance on days that would extend a hohday<br/>or vacation period, a unit member may use leave for<br/>matters of compelling personal importance by submitting<br/>a District Leave Form to the site administrator at least 30<br/>calendar days prior to taking leave for matters of<br/>compelling personal importance. If the unit member fails<br/>to submit the District Leave Form at least 30 calendar<br/>days prior to the leave, the unit member is not eligible for<br/>use of matters of compelling personal importance leave.<br/>The unit member may take unpaid leave described in<br/>Section 8.3.3.</p>

<p>26</p>
<p>8.3.4</p>

<p>Barring unforeseen circumstances, employees shall submit a<br/>request approval of a leave provided for in this Section on a “Leave,<br/>Other Than Personal Sick Leave” form to his/her immediate<br/>supervisor not less than three (3) working days prior to the<br/>beginning date of the leave. This Section shall not apply to leave<br/>taken under Section 8.3.2.7.</p>
<p>The unit member may appeal to the Human Resources Department<br/>in the event of a disapproval of a leave request. The Human<br/>Resources Administrator’s decision on the appeal will be rendered<br/>promptly.</p>
<p>8.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Inquiries</p>
