<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations will be made in writing on the form provided by<br/>the Human Resources Office.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation will assist in enrolling unit members who<br/>wish to contribute to the Sick Leave Bank.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee may donate sick leave credits unless he/she<br/>has a minimum of twenty (20) days accumulated. For the</p>
<p>2008-09 school year only, an employee may donate a day even<br/>though he/she does not have the minimum of twenty (20) days<br/>of accumulated sick leave.</p>

<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to a maximum of 125 days per year in the sick leave<br/>bank may be donated to the sick leave bank for full time<br/>unit members in the Adult Education Program.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the denial of any request to access the<br/>catastrophic leave bank, the Assistant Superintendent for<br/>Human resources shall consult with the Federation President.<br/>If there is no agreement reached between the Assistant<br/>Superintendent and the Federation President, a committee to<br/>review the requests shall be convened to determine the<br/>outcome of the request. The committee shall be composed of<br/>the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, the site</p>
<p>13/179</p>
<p>supervisor, the Federation President and a site Federation<br/>Building Representative.</p>
<p>k. Days in the Sick Leave Bank shall accumulate from year to<br/>year. When the number of banked sick leave days in the Bank<br/>falls to at or below seventy-five (75) days, the District<br/>and the Federation shall work together to distribute a<br/>request for donations to all unit members working in grades<br/>7-12. Unit members who choose not to donate shall become<br/>ineligible to receive sick leave donations from the Bank<br/>even though they have previously contributed. No donation<br/>of sick leave shall be returned. However, a unit member who<br/>has previously contributed to the bank but who does not have<br/>the minimum amount of days required for donation will be<br/>allowed to continue as a member for the remainder of the<br/>school year. In order to continue eligibility in the<br/>following school year, the unit member shall contribute at<br/>least one day at the first opportunity to do so in the next<br/>school year.</p>

<p>D. Illness or Accident Leave - Five (5) School Months or Less:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee is absent from his/her duties on<br/>account of illness or accident for a period of five (5)<br/>school months or less, whether or not the absence<br/>arises out of or in the course of employment of the<br/>employee, the amount deducted from the salary due<br/>him/her for any month in which the absence occurs shall<br/>not exceed the sum which is actually paid a substitute<br/>employee employed to fill his/her position during<br/>his/her absence or, if no substitute employee was<br/>employed, the amount which would have been paid to the<br/>substitute had s/he been employed.</p>
<p>This amount deducted would be the day-to-day substitute<br/>rate (1-10 days and 11-45 days) for absences up to<br/>forty-five (45) days; for absences of more than forty-<br/>five (45) days, the per diem rate at Step Four (4),<br/>Column Three (III), of the salary schedule applied to<br/>the entire period of absence. Deductions shall be<br/>prorated if a part-time substitute is employed. The<br/>District shall make every reasonable effort to secure<br/>the services of a substitute employee.</p>
<p>However, during this period, the District will continue<br/>paying the ongoing costs of all health and welfare<br/>benefits then in force on behalf of the employee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five (5) school months is defined as one hundred (100)<br/>employee workdays between the beginning and end of the<br/>work year, excluding recess days.</p>
<p>15/179</p>
<p>For the first ten (10) working days of absence in a<br/>given school year, current sick leave is used; no<br/>deduction is made from salary. These ten (10) days are<br/>not part of the one hundred (100) days nor are recess<br/>days part of the ten (10) days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ten (10) days of current sick leave have been<br/>used, the one hundred (100) day period commences.<br/>There is no deduction wherein accumulated sick leave is<br/>available to be used.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any remaining balance of the one hundred (100) days<br/>of sick leave in a given school year, after current and<br/>accumulated leave have been used, the employee is<br/>entitled to his/her regular salary, less the cost of<br/>the substitute's pay.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the one hundred (100) day period has been<br/>completed, unless the employee still has accumulated<br/>sick leave to which s/he is entitled, the employee<br/>shall not earn salary of any kind until s/he returns to<br/>duty. Notification shall be made to the Board when the<br/>one hundred (100) day point has been reached. In the<br/>event that District-paid health and welfare benefits<br/>are to be terminated for the employee, s/he shall be so<br/>notified, at least five (5) working days prior to<br/>termination.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If bereavement leave is granted for the critical illness<br/>of a member of the immediate family, subsequent<br/>bereavement leave for critical illness or death of the<br/>same person shall not be granted in the same fiscal year<br/>if the employee uses the maximum days allowed during the<br/>time of critical illness.</p>

<p>property, or the person or property of a member of<br/>his/her immediate family, brother-in-law, or<br/>sister-in-law. As used in this Article, personal<br/>necessity shall mean that the employee's presence<br/>is urgently required elsewhere and not for the<br/>convenience &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or his relatives</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asst. Superintendent of Instructional Services<br/>shall evaluate the applications and proposals for<br/>sabbatical leaves, and make recommendations<br/>regarding the applications and proposals to the<br/>superintendent no later than the December 1 of any<br/>school year. These recommendations shall be based<br/>on guidelines formulated by the Sabbatical Leave<br/>Committee consisting of two (2) members selected<br/>by the Federation and two (2) members selected by<br/>the administration.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, and if appropriate arrangements can<br/>be made, a sabbatical leave may be taken in two<br/>(2) separate semesters provided that the leave is<br/>commenced and completed within a three(3) year<br/>period.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sabbatical leave of absence may be extended as a<br/>non-paid leave of absence without pay, benefits or<br/>salary increment for one (1) additional year,<br/>subject to the provisions of Section P. of this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>j . The employee must file with the Board a suitable<br/>bond indemnifying the District for any salary paid<br/>the employee during the period of sabbatical leave<br/>in the event said employee fails to return and to<br/>render the necessary years of service in this<br/>District following the termination of the<br/>sabbatical leave, or in the event said employee</p>
<p>26/179</p>
<p>fails to carry out the conditions contained in<br/>his/her application and proposal.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of an employee to return and render<br/>service or to complete the scheduled program of<br/>study or travel shall not result in a forfeiture<br/>of the bond when such failure is due to death or<br/>physical or mental disability certified by a<br/>licensed physician. If the employee during the<br/>period of sabbatical leave requests termination of<br/>the sabbatical leave for reasons of physical or<br/>mental disability certified by a physician, the<br/>leave shall be terminated and the employee shall<br/>be entitled to utilize his/her full sick leave<br/>benefits, including the five (5) month provision.<br/>If all sick leave benefits, including the five (5)<br/>month provision, are exhausted within the school<br/>year, the employee shall be considered to be on<br/>non-paid leave of absence for the remainder of the<br/>school year. There shall be no forfeiture of the<br/>indemnity bond, and the employee shall be released<br/>from his/her obligation to complete the<br/>requirements contained in the sabbatical leave<br/>proposal.</p>
<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave shall count toward retirement,<br/>and all retirement contributions of the employee<br/>shall be collected.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall agree to return to employment</p>
<p>with the District for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full year in the</p>
<p>event of a one-half (1/2) year sabbatical leave of<br/>absence, or two (2) full years in the event of a<br/>full year sabbatical leave of absence. The<br/>employee shall agree to notify the Office of the<br/>Superintendent for approval of any projected<br/>change in his/her proposal for professional<br/>improvement.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee returning from a sabbatical leave of</p>
<p>absence shall submit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a</p>
<p>report containing transcripts of all college and<br/>university studies while &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave and/or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a</p>
<p>description of travel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the items&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of</p>
<p>information pertinent to an evaluation of his/her<br/>sabbatical leave activities. A report shall be<br/>made to the Board.</p>
<p>27/179</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make a reasonable effort to<br/>assign employees returning from sabbatical leaves<br/>of absence to the school to which s/he was<br/>assigned prior to the leave.</p>
<p>p. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An applicant who is not selected for a sabbatical<br/>leave shall, upon request, be given a conference<br/>with the person(s) at the level where the leave is<br/>not recommended. If the Board does not approve<br/>the recommendation, the conference, if requested,<br/>shall be with the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee.</p>
<p>T. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Leave:</p>
<p>In the event that two (2) employees wish to request an<br/>unpaid leave of absence for either one (1) semester or for<br/>half (1/2) days for an entire school year, such employees<br/>may be granted such leave requests from a commonly shared<br/>teaching assignment.</p>
<p>Shared leave may be set up in either of two (2) ways:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) employees may share a single assignment on the<br/>basis that Employee &quot;A&quot; may occupy a full-time<br/>assignment during one (1) semester while Employee &quot;B&quot;<br/>is on leave, with the situation being reversed during<br/>the second semester.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) employees may share a common assignment with<br/>each employee teaching throughout the year on a half¬<br/>time (1/2) basis, with Employee &quot;A&quot; receiving the<br/>preparation period for one-half (1/2) the year and<br/>Employee &quot;B&quot; receiving the preparation period for the<br/>second half (1/2) of the year.</p>
<p>Shared leave may be granted upon application to the Board,<br/>and such leave is subject to the provisions governing unpaid<br/>leaves listed herein.</p>

<p>33/179</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the best interest of all parties to resolve class<br/>overloads expeditiously at the beginning of the school year.<br/>It is in the best interest of students and staff to maintain<br/>reasonable sizes in all classes.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrollment projection formulas and staffing formulas that<br/>affect class size shall be reviewed annually and updated if<br/>necessary. Factors to be considered in the determination of<br/>fall class sizes:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historical decline of enrollment from October 1 peak.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipated number of midyear graduates.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students involved in Regional Occupational Program,<br/>hereinafter referred to as &quot;R.O.P.&quot;, work experience, and<br/>other regular off campus instructional activities.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;availability,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and variety of instructional</p>
<p>stations.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience of absenteeism.</p>
<p>6. The number of students enrolled in six (6) classes as<br/>determined by spring enrollment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to determining the allocation of sections at each site,<br/>the administration shall consult with each department chair at<br/>the site. After the second week of instruction in each<br/>semester, the department chairs(s) shall meet with the<br/>administration if there are concerns in the department<br/>regarding class size issues.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is recognized that all the factors indicated in<br/>paragraphs B. 1 through 6 above modify the final class size<br/>achieved in a specific subject area in a specific school, the<br/>following class size averages are suggested to be in effect<br/>for the beginning of the second week of the second semester:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers Ed. (with aide) 51 pupils.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English Language Development (E.L.D.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pupils&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>District chooses to use available categorical funds).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Academic 29 pupils.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduation Requirement Classes (language arts and math for<br/>seniors who have not passed the CAHSEE) 18 pupils.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Services and Consumer Studies 26 pupils.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Technology 26 pupils.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab Courses 26 Pupils (in assigning students to Lab<br/>Courses consideration shall be given to the number of<br/>stations).</p>
<p>34/179</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mt. Toro 21 pupils.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Puente caseloads 35 pupils per unit member.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Education 42 pupils.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to exceed 48 pupils in any one class unless an<br/>aide or other appropriate support is provided.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supported classes not to exceed 52 pupils.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language Arts Intensive 21 pupils. (The ratios in<br/>paragraphs E, F and G of this article shall not apply to<br/>Language Arts Intensive classes. However, sections with<br/>48% or more students with disabilities shall be<br/>supported. )</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business Technology - not to exceed the number of<br/>functioning work stations in the classroom.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Class General Academic 17 pupils, subject to the<br/>provisions in Article VI sections A through L.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Specialist caseload 26 pupils.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moderate to severe - self contained grades 7-12 - caseload<br/>15 pupils.</p>
<p>The District administration and school site administration<br/>shall be guided by these suggested averages when the class<br/>schedules are being developed and staffing calculated. Full<br/>reports on class size shall be given to the Federation at<br/>least three (3) times during the year: on the seventh (7<sup>th</sup>) day<br/>of instruction in the first semester, and on or about the<br/>tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) week of the first semester and on the seventh<br/>(7<sup>th</sup>) day of instruction in the second semester.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students with disabilities in a co-taught class,<br/>whose IEP's identify the subject area of the class as a<br/>service area for the students, shall not exceed thirty-three<br/>percent (33%) of the total class roster. This limitation<br/>shall not apply to pupils receiving itinerant services only,<br/>such as speech, vision and hearing and orthopedic services.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students with disabilities in a class that<br/>follows the &quot;push in&quot; model, whose IEP's identify the subject<br/>area of the class as a service area for the students, shall<br/>not exceed twenty and one half percent (20.5%) of the total<br/>class roster. This limitation shall not apply to pupils<br/>receiving itinerant services only, such as speech, vision and<br/>hearing and orthopedic services.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of student with disabilities in a class that<br/>receives no additional support, whose IEP's identify the<br/>subject area of the class as a service area for the students,<br/>shall not exceed eleven percent (11%) of the total class</p>
<p>roster. This limitation shall not apply to pupils receiving<br/>itinerant services only, such as speech, vision and hearing<br/>and orthopedic services.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve the second semester average class size<br/>preferred averages, it will be necessary to exceed the<br/>suggested enrollment figures early in the fall semester at the<br/>high school level. Historical experience will be considered in<br/>this regard for the enrollment assigned to specific subject<br/>areas and classes but that the overloading in relation to<br/>desired second semester class size should not exceed an<br/>average of seven percent (7%) at the high schools and four<br/>percent (4%) at the middle schools.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students assigned to each teacher per period may<br/>vary widely depending upon the constraints of scheduling, the<br/>number of teaching stations available, the individual<br/>preferences of each teacher, and departmental decisions as to<br/>how students should be distributed within a department. The<br/>District will make reasonable efforts to adjust class size<br/>goals accordingly if the room is small or if the number of<br/>workstations is inadequate to meet the above demands. The<br/>total number of students assigned to each full time teacher<br/>should be equitable.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggested class size averages enumerated in Section D<br/>herein are to be used to determine total class load.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SVFT may upon request meet with the Assistant Superintendent<br/>for Human Resources during the first week of August to review<br/>the projected class sizes and explore ways to mitigate<br/>potential problems. If the average for any teacher exceeds<br/>the goals by four (4%) at the middle schools or seven (7%) in<br/>the high schools or more, the employee subject to the excess<br/>or SVFT shall, upon request, be entitled to a conference with<br/>the Principal or his designee, the master scheduler of the<br/>school and the department chair. Such conference shall not be<br/>scheduled prior to the eighth (8<sup>th</sup>) day of instruction each<br/>fall and spring. The employee may request the presence of a<br/>representative from the Federation. Such conferences shall be<br/>scheduled insofar as possible as not to interfere with the<br/>instructional program of the school. At the conference, the<br/>Principal and the participants shall review with the employee<br/>possible solutions which may include, but not be limited, to<br/>the following:</p>
<p>36/179</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons for the excess.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipated duration of the excess.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible student schedule changes to relieve the excess.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible redistribution of classes within the department.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constraints prohibiting an immediate remedy to the excess.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimate as to when the excess may be eliminated.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible reassignment of teachers within the school.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student absenteeism.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of students to other schools.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring of new teachers.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prohibiting the adding of more students to the classes.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the completion of the conference as specified<br/>herein, the Principal of the appropriate school shall make a<br/>good faith effort to relieve, insofar as possible, the total<br/>class load excess(es) beyond the limits described herein.<br/>Failure of the Principal to effect relief is not and shall not<br/>constitute &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a grievance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided in paragraph L</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>In the event that the problem is still unresolved, the unit<br/>member may appeal to the Assistant Superintendent for Human<br/>Resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within seven&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) instructional days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>receipt of the appeal, the Assistant Superintendent for Human<br/>Resources shall convene a meeting with the unit member, the<br/>site administrator and any other person deemed relevant to the<br/>issue. The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SVFT and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work</p>
<p>cooperatively and provide relief which can include the options<br/>listed in 1 through 11 above or some other mutually acceptable<br/>relief.</p>
<p>L. On the seventh (7th) day of instruction in the Fall semester,<br/>the District shall provide the SVFT President with a report<br/>that shows &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;class averages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>suggested averages plus seven percent (7%) for high schools<br/>and four percent (4%) for middle schools. Between the eighth<br/>(8th) and fourteenth (14th) days of instruction, SVFT and the<br/>affected teacher(s) shall meet with the site principal and<br/>administrator responsible for the Master Schedule to resolve<br/>any problems with the class size averages. In the cases of<br/>non-permanent teachers, SVFT and/or the affected teacher(s)<br/>shall meet with the site principal and administrator<br/>responsible for the Master Schedule to resolve any problems<br/>with the class size averages. If there is no satisfactory<br/>resolution achieved, SVFT and the affected teacher(s) shall<br/>meet with the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources<br/>after the site meeting but no later than the twenty-second</p>
<p>(22<sup>nd</sup>) day of instruction to attempt to resolve any unresolved<br/>issues related to class size averages. In the cases of non¬<br/>permanent teachers, SVFT and/or the affected teacher(s) shall<br/>meet with the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources<br/>after the site meeting but no later than the twenty-second<br/>(22<sup>nd</sup>) day of instruction to attempt to resolve any unresolved<br/>issues related to class size averages. If no resolution is<br/>found to the remaining issues, SVFT may within ten (10) days<br/>of the meeting with the Assistant Superintendent file a<br/>grievance at Level III on the unresolved class size average<br/>issues. In the event that the grievance reaches the Level IV,<br/>the arbitrator shall consider whether the District has acted<br/>in good faith to implement solutions to the class size<br/>overages. The solutions to the overages are those listed<br/>above in paragraph K 1 through 11 plus any mutually agreeable<br/>relief. The same procedures shall be followed in the Spring<br/>Semester as to classes that are new to the Spring Semester and<br/>are not continuing from the Fall Semester, except that the<br/>Fall overages of seven percent (7%) for high schools and four<br/>percent (4%) for middle schools shall not be applicable.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following provisions shall be applicable for counselors:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student/counselor ratio in each of the high schools will<br/>be five hundred to one (500:1).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student/counselor ratio in middle schools will be one<br/>(1) counselor per grade level not to exceed an average of<br/>six hundred fifty to one (650:1), provided a fulltime<br/>technician is employed at the school.</p>
<p>For each increase of one hundred (100) students over one<br/>thousand two hundred (1,200), one (1) additional hour of<br/>counseling will be provided.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above ratios are established with the understanding that<br/>the counselors will be responsible for providing only the<br/>services listed in &quot;Appendix F&quot;.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable efforts shall be made to restore the<br/>counselor/student ratio to four hundred to one (400:1)<br/>should the District's financial situation improve.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologists' ratio shall be one (1) psychologist for each<br/>two thousand two hundred (2,200) students.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the school year, the work experience ratio will be one<br/>hundred twenty-five to one (125:1).</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current practices shall be followed with regard to class size</p>
<p>in instructional programs and/or classes not specifically<br/>enumerated in this Article: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g., music, R.O.P. classes,</p>
<p>R.O.P. coordination. Special Education classes.</p>

<p>Unit members who elect to teach &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sixth (6<sup>th</sup>)</p>
<p>period shall notify the District &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no later than</p>

<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation shall indemnify fully and otherwise hold<br/>harmless the District in the enforcement of this Article.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mutual agreement with the Federation, any teacher who<br/>because of religious beliefs and affiliations cannot pay<br/>fees to a union, may select either the United Way or the<br/>scholarship fund of the District, and the Federation shall<br/>contribute the amount received each month to that charity.</p>
<p>If the Federation and a teacher are not in agreement<br/>concerning the stated prohibition against paying money to a<br/>union, the teacher may appeal the matter in writing to the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee. In such case, an appeal<br/>panel shall be convened. The panel shall be composed of the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, the President of the<br/>Federation or his/her designee, and a third party chosen by</p>
<p>52/179</p>
<p>the other two(2) panel members. The decision of this panel<br/>shall be binding on all parties.</p>
<p>H. Although payment of the Negotiating Service Fee is a<br/>condition of employment, the Federation hereby waives its<br/>rights to require the District to discharge or discipline<br/>bargaining unit members who do not conform to this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>53/179</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX - EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of evaluation is the improvement of the<br/>competence of all employees and thereby the improvement of<br/>the quality of education of all students in the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation shall be a comprehensive process based upon a<br/>District-wide statement of objectives and standards of<br/>expected student achievement as expressed within the current<br/>philosophy and goals of the District. The final decision on<br/>required standards of expected student achievement as<br/>expressed within the current philosophy and goals of the<br/>District shall remain with the Board.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These procedures shall apply to all unit members except that<br/>in the case of teacher trainees hired pursuant to Section</p>
<p>44830.3. of the Education Code, the evaluation provided for<br/>in this Article shall occur at least twice in each of the<br/>first two (2) years of service as a teacher trainee. The<br/>Principal shall evaluate each teacher trainee during the<br/>first two (2) years of service or shall appoint another<br/>administrator for this purpose.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of employees shall be in accordance with the<br/>provisions of the Stull Act (Sections 44660 et. seq. of the<br/>Education Code).</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee shall participate in the setting of objectives<br/>and standards of student achievement for each class taught,<br/>which may include identifying conditions, if any, for<br/>meeting the objectives and standards of student achievement.<br/>These standards shall be consistent with District goals and<br/>standards. Data to facilitate such evaluation of student<br/>achievement may be secured through a number of procedures in<br/>addition to pre and post-tests. Student achievement based<br/>upon these established standards and objectives shall also<br/>be criteria for employee evaluation.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated management employees shall have the<br/>responsibility for completing written evaluation reports and<br/>submitting copies thereof to the employees evaluated. Such<br/>reports shall be based on at least two (2) formal class<br/>observations. The employee will be given the opportunity to<br/>sign the evaluation signifying only that s/he has read it<br/>and not necessarily that s/he agrees with it. Certificated<br/>management evaluators are responsible for the content of<br/>evaluation reports and information obtained from other</p>
<p>54/179</p>
<p>sources must be clearly identified, documented, corroborated<br/>by other sources. Tenured employees who have served in the<br/>District for at least five (5) years in tenured status and<br/>who have received an overall proficient or better rating on<br/>their most recent previous evaluation shall have the option<br/>to select the certificated management evaluator whom they<br/>prefer, according to the following process, and subject to<br/>the limitations contained therein:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each school year, the names of<br/>certificated management evaluators shall be emailed to<br/>all employees and posted on employee bulletin boards at<br/>all schools and other work sites of the District.<br/>There shall be at least twenty-four (24) hours notice,<br/>informing employees where and at what time sign-up for<br/>evaluators will take place.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of evaluatees for which each certificated<br/>management evaluator is responsible shall be clearly<br/>shown.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenured employees scheduled for evaluation during the<br/>year shall have the option of selecting from among the<br/>designated certificated management evaluators at the<br/>employee's work site by signing up for specific<br/>managers on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process shall continue until each certificated<br/>management evaluator has received the number of<br/>identified evaluatees for which s/he is scheduled to<br/>evaluate.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where an evaluatee, through this process, must<br/>choose an evaluator who the evaluatee believes is not<br/>appropriate, the evaluatee may submit a request for a<br/>change of—evaluator to the site principal, who shall<br/>forward the request to the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Human Resources. Any such request shall be made no<br/>later than the 14<sup>th</sup> week of the beginning of the work<br/>year for unit members. Upon receipt of the request the<br/>Assistant Superintendent shall grant a change of<br/>evaluator to the evaluatee. The alternative evaluator<br/>shall be selected at the discretion of the Assistant<br/>Superintendent from other evaluators at the site or in<br/>the District at large.</p>
<p>55/179</p>
<p>6. Evaluation and assessment of employees shall<br/>involve an additional evaluator when requested by the<br/>employee within the evaluation cycle.</p>
<p>An individual conference to discuss the evaluation shall be<br/>held at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the school<br/>year. The employee may submit a written response to the<br/>evaluation. The employee shall have five (5) working days<br/>in which to submit the written response, and up to five (5)<br/>additional working days with the approval of the Principal<br/>or Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources.</p>
<p>Summative Evaluation report(s) and any written response or<br/>any statement regarding the conference shall be filed in the<br/>employee's personnel folder in the District Human Resources<br/>Office. Summative evaluation information contained in<br/>employee personnel files shall be available only to those<br/>persons authorized by law to review such information. If,<br/>however, the employee feels that the procedures for<br/>evaluating have not been followed, s/he may file a grievance<br/>on that basis, in which case the evaluation will bear an<br/>attached statement on its face that a grievance is being<br/>processed. Until that grievance is resolved, the evaluation<br/>shall not become a permanent record.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is under a plan of assistance, the written<br/>observation forms shall include reference to the plan and<br/>the progress or lack of progress the unit members has made</p>
<p>on the plan.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summative evaluations of employees shall include the written</p>
<p>observations, documentation, and plan(s) of assistance, if<br/>appropriate that include specific recommendations for any<br/>area which needs improvement or is unsatisfactory in<br/>performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;included&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summative</p>
<p>evaluations shall relate to established criteria as set<br/>forth in Sections D. and E. contained herein. Under no<br/>circumstances shall the evaluator use any information<br/>concerning an event of a derogatory nature of which the<br/>employee was not informed within twenty (20) working days of<br/>verifying the legitimacy of the precipitating event(s).<br/>Subsequently, one (1) or more conferences shall be held with<br/>the employee to assist him/her in correcting deficiencies<br/>previously noted. A record of such conferences, including<br/>deficiencies, which have been corrected, shall be prepared<br/>by the evaluator for the file of the evaluatee and a copy<br/>submitted to him/her.</p>
<p>56/179</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Summative Evaluation with one (1) or more of the<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession rated as<br/>&quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; shall be considered an overall rating of<br/>&quot;Unsatisfactory&quot;. No unit member shall be given a &quot;Needs<br/>Improvement&quot; or &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; rating for refusing to<br/>participate in professional development outside of the<br/>professional duty day or contracted work year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent teacher receiving a Summative Evaluation<br/>with an overall rating of &quot;Proficient&quot; or &quot;Distinguished&quot;<br/>may with the approval of the site administrator participate<br/>in the alternative evaluation procedures provided pursuant<br/>to paragraphs L or N herein below.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each written formal observation shall include a<br/>classroom observation documented on the agreed upon<br/>observation form, documentation, and recommendation(s) , if<br/>applicable, for any area which needs improvement.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each formal-observation shall be followed by a<br/>post observation conference at which the teacher shall<br/>receive a copy of the completed formal observation<br/>report. The post observation conference shall include<br/>a discussion of the observation.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each post-observation conference should be held<br/>within ten (10) working days of the observation unless<br/>there are extenuating circumstances or there is mutual<br/>agreement between the evaluator and the teacher.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member may, until January 31 in the year,<br/>request verbally, which shall be confirmed in writing<br/>within 24 hours, a follow up observation by the<br/>evaluator which shall be granted. A post-observation<br/>conference shall also be held. If the performance<br/>needs improvement in any area, recommendation(s) shall<br/>be developed by the evaluator.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All summative evaluations that have areas marked as<br/>&quot;Needs Improvement&quot; or &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; shall include a<br/>plan of assistance. The Plan of Assistance shall be<br/>jointly developed by the evaluator and evaluate. In<br/>the event agreement cannot be reached on the Plan of<br/>Assistance after a mutual attempt to develop a join<br/>plan, the evaluator shall make the ultimate decision on<br/>the Plan.</p>
<p>57/179</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These evaluation procedures shall be implemented in<br/>accordance with a calendar prepared annually by the District<br/>Human Resources Office. (See Appendix D.)</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall preclude the right of the<br/>District to make additional observations or evaluations<br/>during any year and/or implement plans of assistance for any<br/>employee during any year, when documented need exists for<br/>such a plan of assistance.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee or a representative s/he has designated in<br/>writing may review with the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Human Resources or his/her authorized designee, evaluation<br/>materials contained in the District Office personnel file<br/>before or after regularly assigned duties. Subsequent to<br/>receiving the first copy of the evaluation document free of<br/>charge, employees may secure additional copies of evaluation<br/>documents at the cost established in the District's policy<br/>on citizen access to public information.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of Section I. above, permanent</p>
<p>employees shall be evaluated every other year, and non¬<br/>permanent employees shall be evaluated each year. Permanent<br/>employees with more than ten (10) years in the District may<br/>be evaluated every five (5)years upon the mutual consent of<br/>the evaluator and the evaluatee. Either the evaluator or<br/>the employee may withdraw consent at any time to the five-<br/>year evaluation schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R.O.P.</p>
<p>teachers, evaluations shall normally be done every other<br/>year. Part-time and probationary R.O.P. teachers shall be<br/>evaluated annually.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices of Unsatisfactory Performance pursuant to Education<br/>Code section 44938 shall not be given to a permanent<br/>certificated employee unless the District has complied with<br/>provisions of paragraph G. above.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PEER EVALUATION PROCEDURE <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1. A permanent unit member with a minimum of ten (10)years<br/>of experience in the teaching profession with five (5)<br/>of those years as a permanent certificated employee in<br/>the District may, with the agreement of another<br/>permanent unit member with a minimum of five (5) years<br/>of experience in the District who is also scheduled for<br/>evaluation, participate in peer evaluation process<br/>subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>58/179</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each permanent unit member must have had an overall<br/>evaluation rating of &quot;Proficient&quot; or above over the<br/>last two (2) evaluation cycles.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the school year in accordance<br/>with the agreed evaluation calendar for that year,<br/>those permanent unit members wishing to participate<br/>in the peer evaluation process must notify their<br/>respective evaluating administrator of their intent.<br/>The evaluating administrator shall either approve or<br/>deny any request within ten (10) school days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a pre-evaluation conference held in accordance with<br/>the District's evaluation calendar for the year, the peer<br/>evaluators and their evaluating administrator shall meet,<br/>discuss, and mutually agree upon the evaluation plan. The<br/>evaluation shall be on the forms negotiated by the District<br/>and SVFT.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing above shall be construed to release evaluatee(s)<br/>from their normal job responsibilities, the need to adhere<br/>to State and District curriculum requirements and the<br/>teaching techniques outlined in the California Teaching<br/>Standards as described in the standard evaluation form, and<br/>the Education Code.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peer evaluators shall present the results of the<br/>agreed-upon evaluation plans to their evaluating<br/>administrator. At a final evaluation conference with the<br/>evaluatees the evaluating administrator shall review the<br/>evaluation process and contents. If the evaluating<br/>administrator concurs, s/he shall finalize the<br/>evaluation process by signing the summary evaluation<br/>forms for inclusion in their respective personnel files.<br/>In the event that the evaluating administrator disagrees<br/>with the process or content s/he must attach a written<br/>statement outlining reason for the disagreement. The<br/>evaluation, with the written attachment, will be<br/>submitted to the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources. The Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources may authorize the administrator to conduct an<br/>evaluation the following year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation plan may be modified by mutual agreement<br/>between the peer evaluatees and the evaluating<br/>administrator or the peer evaluation process or the peer<br/>evaluation process may be terminated at any time by the</p>
<p>59/179</p>
<p>peer evaluatees or the evaluating administrator. The<br/>evaluates participating in the peer evaluation process<br/>may unilaterally elect to return to the regular<br/>evaluation process by notifying the Principal, in<br/>writing, no later than December 1<sup>st</sup> of the evaluation<br/>year. In the event of a change to the regular<br/>evaluation process, both parties shall mutually agree on<br/>objectives and an appropriate timeline, which shall<br/>supersede the timeline &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specified in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District</p>
<p>evaluation calendar for that year.</p>
<p>6. Except as noted above, all other sections of Article IX<br/>shall remain in force for the peer evaluation process.</p>
<p>60/179</p>
<p>ARTICLE X - PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS</p>
<p>No bargaining unit member shall be disciplined except for just<br/>cause. Discipline imposed shall be proportionate to the proven<br/>offense taking into account, where appropriate, the concept of<br/>progressive discipline.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposed of this Article, &quot;discipline&quot; means any</p>
<p>suspension without pay for up to fifteen (15) days and/or<br/>any derogatory &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(not directive) writing issued by the</p>
<p>District to a bargaining unit member which may serve as a<br/>basis for affecting the status of that unit member's<br/>employment. For purposes of this Article, &quot;writings&quot; shall<br/>include but not be limited to Notices of Unprofessional<br/>Conduct pursuant to Education Code section 44938. Notices<br/>of Unprofessional Conduct shall not be grievable under this<br/>Article while charges of dismissal, based on the facts<br/>contained in the Notice, are filed against the bargaining<br/>unit member, or if the unit member is terminated or found to<br/>have committed the alleged act by a Commission of<br/>Professional Competence.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alleged violations of this Article shall be processed</p>
<p>through the grievance procedure except: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that the</p>
<p>decision of the arbitrator with respect to any alleged<br/>violation(s) of this Article shall be final and binding of<br/>the parties; (2) that grievances under this Article to<br/>challenge Notices of Unprofessional Conduct shall not be<br/>filed until after 120 days from the expiration of the notice<br/>period; (3) that the time limit for filing a grievance to<br/>challenge a Notice of Unprofessional Conduct shall not begin<br/>to run until after 120 days from the expiration of Notice<br/>period; and (4) that all time limits pertaining to a<br/>grievance to challenge a Notice of Unprofessional Conduct<br/>shall be tolled while charges of suspension or dismissal<br/>based upon the facts contained in the Notice are pending<br/>against the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have the power to rule on all issues of<br/>procedural and substantive arbitrability that arise as a<br/>result of grievances that allege a violation of this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article shall apply only to permanent certificated<br/>employees of the District. This Article shall not apply to<br/>evaluations pursuant to Article IX. or Notices of<br/>Unsatisfactory Performance pursuant to Education Code</p>
<p>61/179</p>
<p>section 44938. However, the arbitrator shall have the<br/>authority to determine whether a Notice of Unsatisfactory<br/>Performance pursuant to Education Code section 44938 was<br/>given as a subterfuge to avoid the provisions of this<br/>Article X.</p>
<p>62/179</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI - WAGES</p>
<p>SALARY SCHEDULE:</p>
<p>Effective July 1, of the current fiscal year, the salary</p>
<p>schedule shall be that contained in Appendix B. except as</p>
<p>otherwise provided for in this Agreement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New employees shall be placed on the salary schedule<br/>based upon one (1) step for each year of previous<br/>teaching experience up to a total of seven (7) years.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers initially employed for the 1968-69 school year<br/>or thereafter, and placed on Column One (I) or Column<br/>Two (II) of the salary schedule may not advance beyond<br/>the dotted line therein.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New employees may be granted one (1) year of credit on<br/>the salary schedule for military services, provided the<br/>months of military service number eighteen (18) or<br/>more. Credit for military service may be used as part<br/>of the fifteen (15) years of credit allowed for<br/>teaching experience, but not in addition thereto.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition of units earned, degrees awarded, or degree<br/>equivalent shall be granted when such units, degrees,<br/>or degree equivalents are earned from an accredited<br/>college or university, or such units, degrees or degree<br/>equivalents are evaluated and accepted by an accredited<br/>college or university. Recognition of units earned,<br/>degrees awarded, or degree equivalents may be granted,<br/>upon approval, by the Board if such units, degrees, or<br/>degree equivalents are earned from an institution which<br/>has been granted approval status under Section 94310.,<br/>sub-paragraph B., of the Education Code, or such units,<br/>degrees, or degree equivalents are evaluated and<br/>accepted by an institution which has acquired approval<br/>status as set forth in Section 94310., Sub-paragraph B.<br/>of the Education Code. Recognition of units earned,<br/>degrees awarded, or degree equivalents shall under no<br/>other circumstances be granted if awarded by an<br/>institution defined as exempted under Section 94303.,<br/>Sub-paragraph B., of the Education Code. Further, no<br/>other recognition of units earned, degrees awarded, or<br/>degrees equivalent are awarded by an institution<br/>granted authorized status under Section 94310, Sub-<br/>paragraph C. of the Education Code.</p>
<p>63/179</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>In determining units beyond a given degree for the<br/>purpose of placement on the salary schedule, the date<br/>of completion of academic requirements for said degree<br/>as certified by the issuing institution shall be used.<br/>However, the District may grant postgraduate credit for<br/>units taken during the last quarter or semester of the<br/>baccalaureate program, provided:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accredited college grants graduate credit, or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission for Teacher Credentialing accepts<br/>the units as post-graduate (effective July 1,<br/>1966, not retroactive).</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided by criteria established<br/>for academic equivalency placement, employees who hold<br/>a valid California teaching credential, but do not have<br/>a Bachelor's degree or its equivalent, shall be limited<br/>to Column One (I).</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria for placement on the salary schedule under<br/>academic equivalency provisions as adopted May 23, 1968<br/>are available in the Human Resources Office.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New employees to be placed on the salary schedule in<br/>accordance with the criteria for academic equivalency<br/>shall be granted one (1) step for each five (5) years<br/>of verified employment directly relating to the<br/>prospective assignment, up to a maximum of five (5)<br/>steps.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units earned for consideration of advanced placement on</p>
<p>the salary schedule shall fall within: 1. the major or<br/>minor teaching field of the employee, or; 2. the<br/>employee's current teaching area, or; 3. a new teaching<br/>major or minor approved by the Assistant Superintendent<br/>of Human Resources, or; 4. classes which apply directly<br/>to the educational climate in the employee's classroom.<br/>All &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;units earned for consideration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of advanced</p>
<p>placement on the salary schedule shall have the<br/>approval of the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources. Employees should acquire prior approval to<br/>avoid possible disapproval of credits for advance<br/>placement. Requests for approval after completion of<br/>units earned shall not be considered after October 1<br/>for salary schedule placement for each school year.<br/>Transcripts or other evidence acceptable to the</p>
<p>64/179</p>
<p>District verifying units earned must be filed in the<br/>Human Resources Office no later than October 1 of each<br/>school year.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No salary payments to new employees will be made until<br/>the official transcripts of record and verifications of<br/>teaching experience are filed in the Human Resources<br/>Office.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members with an earned doctorate shall receive<br/>an additional two and fifty-four/one-hundredths percent<br/>(2.54%) of base pay.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No change in salary status shall be made by reason of<br/>change in salary classification unless such notice of<br/>intention to be considered for salary classification<br/>change has been filed in the Human Resources Office by<br/>May 15 of the previous school year.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vertical placement of continuing employees on the<br/>salary schedule shall be limited to advancing one (1)<br/>step each year regardless of the number of years<br/>accrued at the previous step, except as provided below.</p>
<p>Employees will receive an annual salary increment<br/>(vertical placement) as provided by the salary schedule<br/>(See Appendix B) provided they have not been placed on<br/>a Plan of Assistance as authorized by Article IX.,<br/>Sections G. and I., for not less than sixty (60) school<br/>days and have failed to make substantial improvement in<br/>each of the specified areas of deficiency as determined<br/>by the evaluator or his/her successor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</p>
<p>determination to withhold the salary increment shall be<br/>made no later than June 1 of the school year and shall<br/>be effective as to the salary increment otherwise<br/>available to the employee in the successive school<br/>year.</p>
<p>Money withheld as a salary increment may be made<br/>available to the affected employee for necessary<br/>documented expenses incurred in seeking to upgrade<br/>his/her skills as prescribed in a Plan of Assistance.<br/>The District's intent is that the withheld increment<br/>will be used for expenses incurred in improvement if<br/>the person's attitude is open to improvement. Details<br/>on the reimbursable expenses will be worked out in each<br/>case with the Federation.</p>
<p>65/179</p>
<p>No employee shall be placed on a Plan of Assistance<br/>unless first warned in writing by an evaluator serving<br/>under Article IX., Section F. and/or G., or by an<br/>evaluator exercising the authority of Article IX.,<br/>Section I., that improvement or correction is necessary<br/>in a specified area of deficiency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as is</p>
<p>possible, the same administrator whom the employee has<br/>previously picked as an evaluator will implement a Plan<br/>of Assistance. Nothing contained herein would prevent<br/>another administrator who has personal and direct<br/>knowledge and/or experience with the unsatisfactory<br/>performance of the staff person from doing a Plan of<br/>Assistance when the chosen evaluator does not have such<br/>personal knowledge and experience. Exceptions to this<br/>warning requirement will apply however, in instances of<br/>gross misbehavior or conduct including, but not limited<br/>to, assault on a pupil or another employee, or criminal<br/>conduct on school premises affecting students and<br/>employees.</p>
<p>The evaluator must review the Plan of Assistance upon<br/>the employee's request approximately every twenty (20)<br/>school days for the duration of the Plan of Assistance.<br/>Written progress reports will be given to the employee<br/>at such conference (s) . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conference,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if</p>
<p>substantial improvement has taken place in all areas,<br/>the employee shall be taken off the Plan of Assistance.<br/>The evaluator has the right to confer with the employee<br/>at any time during the Plan of Assistance.</p>
<p>The employee may appeal the withholding of the salary<br/>increment to a three (3)-person panel within five (5)<br/>working days of the receipt by the employee of the<br/>evaluator's determination. The panel shall have up to<br/>ten (10) working days to review the determination.<br/>After reaching a decision, the panel shall make a<br/>recommendation for approval or rejection of that<br/>determination to the Board no later than its next<br/>regularly scheduled meeting. After receiving the<br/>recommendation from the panel, the Board shall make a<br/>final decision within twenty (20) calendar days.</p>
<p>The three (3) person panel shall be composed of an<br/>employee selected by the District, an employee selected<br/>by the Federation in consultation with the affected<br/>employee concerned, and a &quot;neutral&quot; person agreed upon<br/>by the Federation and the District from a list of</p>
<p>66/179</p>
<p>persons previously selected by the District and the<br/>Federation for this purpose. The panel's written<br/>recommendations to approve or reject the evaluator's<br/>determination shall be advisory and submitted orally to<br/>the Board by the &quot;neutral&quot; member of the panel. The<br/>Board shall hear the matter in closed session unless<br/>the employee requests an open session.</p>
<p>Where an employee has had a salary increment withheld<br/>and is subsequently removed from the Plan of<br/>Assistance, the employee shall receive the salary and<br/>increment for which the employee is otherwise eligible<br/>had s/he not been placed on the Plan of Assistance. No<br/>retroactive payment of the lost increment shall be<br/>made, however.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longevity increment steps on the salary schedule shall<br/>be awarded to employees at the sixteenth (16th),<br/>nineteenth (19th), twenty-second (22nd), twenty-fifth<br/>(25th) , twenty-eighth (28th) , and thirty-first (31<sup>st</sup>)<br/>year of service credit in the District. The amount of<br/>the longevity increment will be increased by the salary<br/>adjustment applied to the total salary schedule each<br/>year.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVI ~ IN-LIEU/COMPENSATION FOR SUBSTITUTE</p>
<p>SERVICE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In Lieu&quot; is defined as the performance of substitute<br/>service by an employee during his/her assigned preparation<br/>period. A &quot;conference period&quot; does not qualify as a<br/>&quot;preparation period&quot;. Accordingly, special education staff<br/>who also receive conference periods may not perform or<br/>receive in-lieu during conference periods, except as<br/>indicated in Paragraph I.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for in lieu service shall be granted on a period for<br/>period basis. Under normal circumstances, employees may<br/>perform and earn only one (1) period/block of substitute in<br/>lieu credit per school day. For the purposes of this<br/>article, &quot;instructional staff&quot; means unit members who are<br/>serving as classroom teachers.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu shall be compensated with either scheduled time off<br/>or cashed out at the end of the calendar year. This option<br/>shall be decided each December and shall be effective for<br/>all in lieu earned in the subsequent calendar year. New<br/>unit members shall make this election at the time they are<br/>hired. The employee who has earned in lieu credit may accrue<br/>in lieu time up to thirty-six (36) hours during a calendar<br/>year at the curriculum rate.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in lieu time earned by a unit member who selected to<br/>&quot;cash out&quot; shall be paid on the December supplemental pay<br/>warrant at the curriculum rate. These unit members shall<br/>not be eligible for time off as the member selected &quot;cash</p>
<p>out.&quot;</p>
<p>b. Unit members selecting to take in lieu as time off shall<br/>take the time off during the calendar year or may carry<br/>over to the following calendar year up to eighteen (18)<br/>hours of accrued in lieu time. Any accrued in lieu time<br/>that is not taken as time off and not eligible for carry<br/>over shall be cashed out on the December supplemental pay<br/>warrant at the curriculum rate.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of employment for any reason, including<br/>retirement, any remaining in lieu shall be monetarily<br/>compensated at the curriculum rate applicable at the time<br/>of termination.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu substitute service by unit members shall first be</p>
<p>solicited from amongst available instructional staff on a<br/>voluntary basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>77/179</p>
<p>instructional staff may indicate whether they wish to be on<br/>the volunteer list for substituting in the following year.<br/>The principal or designee shall use the volunteer list first<br/>when assigning substitute service. If no volunteers are<br/>willing or available from the volunteer list, the Principal<br/>or designee shall then request volunteers from available<br/>instructional staff on a rotating basis so that no<br/>individual in the rotation is consistently called upon<br/>first. In the event that no volunteer can be obtained to<br/>substitute, any certificated employee may be assigned. Such<br/>involuntary assignments shall be on an occasional basis.</p>
<p>E. Non-instructional certificated staff members such as<br/>counselors, librarians, work-experience specialists,<br/>teachers on special assignment, and ROP coordinators may<br/>earn in lieu time or be entitled to compensation when their<br/>services are required to substitute for classroom teachers<br/>subject to paragraph D and under the following criteria and<br/>limitations.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-instructional staff member must hold<br/>a valid teaching credential.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools will exhaust all other possible<br/>sources for covering the class prior to<br/>requesting a non-instructional staff member<br/>to take an assignment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-instructional staff member who<br/>performs a substitute assignment will make<br/>arrangements with the Principal to make up<br/>that hour either after or before the regular<br/>work day or during his/her duty free lunch<br/>period. As another alternative, the non-<br/>instructional staff members may review with<br/>the Principal an hour equivalent work to be<br/>completed at home.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of this time will be subject to all<br/>current requirements of this Article.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu assigned or earned substituting for a<br/>classroom teacher shall be limited to thirty<br/>(30) hours per person per school year.</p>
<p>F. Accumulated in lieu compensatory time may be transferred by<br/>employee (s) to the district catastrophic leave bank as<br/>described in Article IV, subsection C.</p>
<p>78/179</p>
<p>G. In order to minimize the impact of employees using in lieu<br/>for time off, the following rules shall apply:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use unlimited in lieu for<br/>absences during their preparation period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use in lieu for a partial<br/>day absence no more than five (5) times per<br/>year unless permission is obtained from the<br/>Principal to exceed this limit.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may not use more than a total of<br/>six (6) days of in lieu per semester to take<br/>time off.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No in lieu time may be taken during the first<br/>and last work weeks of the year, the first<br/>work week of second semester, and state<br/>mandated testing, minimum days with the<br/>exception of the last day before winter break<br/>(when calendared) , and the last two weeks of<br/>employment unless the resignation is for<br/>reasons beyond the employee's control. The<br/>Principal may, at his or her sole discretion,<br/>grant an exception to this provision and<br/>allow in lieu to be taken during the above<br/>mentioned time periods upon written<br/>application from the employee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the maximum number of</p>
<p>instructional staff that may be absent on in<br/>lieu credit on any given day at a school<br/>site: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high school =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5; middle school =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4;</p>
<p>schools with less than 15 instructional staff<br/>=3. A sign-up sheet shall be made available<br/>at the Principal's office. Employees must<br/>indicate a planned absence on the sign-up<br/>sheet, fill out an in lieu request form, and<br/>report the absence through the district-<br/>adopted absence management system. If more<br/>than the maximum wish to take in lieu on a<br/>given day, the right to take in lieu shall be<br/>granted on a first-come, first-served basis.<br/>If the employee uses the in lieu for a<br/>preparation period, the employee is only<br/>required to verbally inform the secretary 48<br/>hours in advance and fill out an in lieu</p>
<p>79/179</p>
<p>request form. The Principal may deny the use<br/>of in lieu for a preparation period if twenty<br/>percent (20%) or more of the instructional<br/>staff are absent from work on that day.</p>
<p>H. The serving of an in lieu substituting assignment and the<br/>use of in lieu credit does not absolve employees of their<br/>professional obligations as defined elsewhere in this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>I. Special Education teachers at sites with block or rotating<br/>schedules that create a combined preparation/conference<br/>period may be required to perform in lieu substitute service<br/>during that period, but shall not perform in lieu substitute<br/>service on two consecutive workdays.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANDATORY REFERRAL FOR PERMANENT TEACHERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandatory referral process to the Peer Assistance<br/>and Review program shall begin when a permanent teacher<br/>receives an Unsatisfactory rating on any one of<br/>Standards I-V on the Final Certificated Personnel<br/>Evaluation form.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation must be made by the principal or<br/>designee and must follow upon at least two formal<br/>observations. The principal shall make a referral to<br/>the Joint Panel in the spring after the final<br/>evaluation conference with the teacher. In the<br/>referral the principal shall submit copies of his/her<br/>evaluation documents, including reports of classroom<br/>observations, teacher responses to observations, and<br/>recommendations for improvement that were made to the<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>3. Any Unsatisfactory rating on Standards VI and VII shall<br/>not be subject to the Peer Assistance and Review<br/>process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal or designee may address a</p>
<p>teacher's deficiencies in Standard VI or VII under<br/>Article X of the contract or with some other remedy as<br/>appropriate.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPLEMENTATION OF REVIEW PROCESS</p>
<p>1. The Joint Panel shall begin implementation of the Peer<br/>Assistance and Review process once the mandatory<br/>referral of a permanent teacher has been made. Before</p>
<p>98/179</p>
<p>the beginning of the following school year, the Panel<br/>shall notify the participant by registered mail that<br/>he/she has been referred for PAR program intervention.<br/>The notification shall also provide the participant<br/>with a list of Peer Assistants who are available<br/>through the Program. The participant shall have ten<br/>(10) working days to submit a request for a particular<br/>Peer Assistant.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that every possible subject matter</p>
<p>competency may not be available within the corps of<br/>Peer Assistants, and therefore, occasionally it shall<br/>be necessary to secure Subject Area Specialists to<br/>fully address identified deficiencies. In such cases,<br/>the Peer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain primary</p>
<p>responsibility for the Individual Improvement Plan.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the assignment of a Peer Assistant has been made,</p>
<p>a conference shall be held to begin the development of<br/>the Individual Improvement Plan. The conference shall<br/>involve the Participant, the Peer Assistant, and the<br/>Participant's evaluator. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this conference the</p>
<p>Participant shall have the right to request additional<br/>assistance if needed. The Participant has the right to<br/>request union representation at this meeting.</p>
<p>4. It is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected that Participants&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall receive</p>
<p>assistance as described (in the Peer Assistant Duties<br/>section). The Peer Assistant shall share all written<br/>or verbal progress reports with the Participant at<br/>least once a month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress reports shall relate</p>
<p>specifically to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement Plan</p>
<p>approved by the Joint Panel. A monthly written report<br/>shall be forwarded to the Participant's evaluator and<br/>the Panel, including any progress reports from other<br/>individuals assisting the Participant.</p>
<p>5. Nothing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this section shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preclude the</p>
<p>Participant's evaluator from making observations and<br/>evaluations or from communicating with the Participant<br/>regarding his/her &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfillment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of professional</p>
<p>obligations subject to the provisions of the contract.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By April 15<sup>th</sup> each Peer Assistant shall schedule a<br/>final conference with the participant and the<br/>evaluating administrator to go over the Peer<br/>Assistant's conclusions for the Individual Improvement</p>
<p>99/179</p>
<p>Plan. The Peer Assistant shall then make a final<br/>report of progress to the Joint Panel under the<br/>Individual Improvement Plan. The Participant shall<br/>have the opportunity to appear before the Joint Panel<br/>in response to this final report of progress. The Peer<br/>Assistant's report may include &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any</p>
<p>individual providing additional assistance to the<br/>participant under the Individual Improvement Plan.</p>
<p>7. In general the period of peer assistance shall be for<br/>up to two full school years. After each year of peer<br/>assistance, based on the report of progress from the<br/>Peer Assistant and the response of the participant the<br/>Joint Panel may report to the participant, the<br/>Superintendent and the Board of Trustees that:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participant has demonstrated satisfactory<br/>progress in the instructional areas of evaluation<br/>where improvement was needed, and should return to<br/>the regular evaluation process, or;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory progress has not been made, but that<br/>the participant is making progress, and that the<br/>intervention should be extended for a another<br/>year, or;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two full school years of peer assistance, if<br/>the Joint Panel does not believe progress has been<br/>made, or that further assistance or remediation<br/>will not be successful, with documented reasons to<br/>support this conclusion, the District may then<br/>initiate dismissal proceedings, continue to employ<br/>the teacher, or issue a Notice of Unsatisfactory<br/>Performance pursuant to the provisions to the<br/>Contract and the Education Code.</p>
<p>8. The discussions of the Joint Panel regarding the<br/>intervention shall be closed and confidential. Its<br/>decision shall be based on classroom performance,<br/>information provided by the Peer Assistant, the<br/>participant, the evaluating administrator, and a<br/>representative from the Salinas Valley Federation of<br/>Teachers.</p>

The funding allocated by the State<br/>shall have uses determined by the Joint Panel. In no<br/>case shall the cost of the program exceed the finding<br/>allocated by the State of California for this program<br/>or the added allocation of the BTSA programs, should<br/>they become available to the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District and the Salinas Valley<br/>Federation of Teachers to make the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review process a subject of future negotiations.</p>

<p>APPENDIX J — Side Letter of Agreement Regarding</p>
<p>Conference Periods</p>
<p>The Salinas Union High School District (&quot;District&quot;) and Salinas<br/>Valley Federation of Teachers (&quot;SVFT&quot;) hereby enter into this<br/>side letter of agreement regarding conference periods.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference periods were created to allow special<br/>education staff sufficient time to perform tasks, which<br/>are unique to the special education program and required<br/>in order to maintain legal compliance with special<br/>education laws. Accordingly, duties performed during<br/>conference periods shall include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting I.E.P. meetings</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing/testing students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating with parents, home visits</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating with outside services or agencies, such<br/>as County Mental Health, Probation Department, Adult<br/>School, Department of Rehabilitation, ROP, Employers,<br/>Community Colleges or other educational resources,<br/>prevention and healthcare services, and others related<br/>to the rendering of student services</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing special education students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborating with main-stream teachers; modify<br/>assignments and student homework as needed</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing and maintaining forms</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring attendance and behavior</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings with students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing matriculation issues</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving as a resource to student study teams</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where conference period functions impinge on the<br/>teacher's preparation time, the balance of the conference<br/>period may be used for prep time purposes.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special education staff who leave campus during working<br/>hours to perform these duties are expected to notify<br/>their supervisor or the school's front office of their<br/>departure and return.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School sites with block or rotating schedules will<br/>designate a block as a conference/preparation.</p>

<p>semester. Each middle school will have up to twelve (12) team leaders. Stipends wiil<br/>not be paid from General Fund (restricted funds only).</p>
<p>Those teachers who are the sole provider of a subject area on their campus will meet<br/>with other similar subject area teachers in the district. It is understood that in order to<br/>accomplish this, the teachers involved will be outside of the contract day (eg. Allowing<br/>for travel time back to the individual's site would necessitate starting earlier). This time<br/>will be credited against the teacher's adjunct duty requirement.</p>
<p>Each team will provide an agreed upon, explicit, set of group norms to the site<br/>administration by the second week of each school year.</p>
<p>Each team will provide the agreed upon form and supporting materials (eg.<br/>Goals/assessments/etc.) to the site administration each week. Administration will make<br/>sure that intervention providers (eg. Opportunity teachers, SPED teachers, IS teachers,<br/>Alt. Ed teachers) are provided with the work products of the academic teams.</p>
<p>If a team determines that it needs support/help from outside the team, the team leader<br/>will work with the department chair, and the site administration, to find and provide the<br/>appropriate help. Any expense for this purpose wiil not be paid from General Fund<br/>(restricted funds only).</p>

<p>^ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REDUCTION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WORK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YEAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESTORATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FORMULA/LANGUAGE</p>
<p>1. The 2010-2011 contract year shall include five (5)</p>
<p>certificated furlough days to be mutually determined by<br/>SVFT and the District.</p>
<p>. (</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>If furloughs are in effect, the bargaining unit members'<br/>work year will be reduced accordingly to ensure that<br/>employees receive a complete year of service credit for</p>
<p>2010-2011.</p>
<p>3. The percentage of salary reduced shall be equal to 2.7% of<br/>each employee's salary. Bargaining unit members who are<br/>not on a 184 day schedule shall have their work days<br/>reduced by the number of days necessary to equal a 2.7%<br/>pay reduction.</p>
<p>4. If all other employees of the District do not accept</p>
<p>furlough days greater or equal to a 2.7% pay reduction all<br/>SVFT agreed upon furlough days will be restored.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District receives additional local, state, or<br/>federal revenue, for each increment equivalent to 0.54% of<br/>funded Base Revenue Limit, then such revenues that are not<br/>specifically restricted by law from being used for<br/>certificated salaries shall be directed toward restoring<br/>furlough days until all furlough days and corresponding<br/>salary are restored.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each 0.54% increase to the District's funded Base<br/>Revenue Limit per Average Daily Attendance (BRL/ADA)<br/>compared to 2010-11 proposed BRL/ADA in the Governor's<br/>initial released budget, a furlough day will be restored<br/>with the corresponding salary increase until all five (5)<br/>furlough days are restored. Increases to the BRL/ADA shall<br/>include all increases to the District's funded BRL/ADA<br/>including cost of living adjustments, deficit reduction,<br/>equalization aid, and/or any other permanent ongoing<br/>increases to the District's funded BRL/ADA. Any increase<br/>in revenues in excess of the amounts needed to fully<br/>restore the furlough days, shall be applied as a<br/>percentage increase to the salary and health benefit cap<br/>until the deficit factor is 100%. When the deficit factor<br/>is 100%, all new ongoing revenues, with the exception of</p>
<p>169/179</p>
<p>equalization dollars, will be applied as a percentage<br/>increase to the salary schedule and health benefit cap.<br/>Equalization money shall be subject to negotiations. See<br/>formula attachment.</p>
<p>7. If the increase to the funded BRL/ADA is not enough to<br/>restore a complete furlough day then the remaining<br/>percentage increase shall be applied to the salary<br/>schedule and health benefit cap as follows (see below)</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>8. Furlough days will be restored if proposed cuts are not<br/>made, (see attached budget documents)</p>

<p>Appendix O - Salary and Benefit Compensation Agreement</p>
<p>SALINAS VALLEY FEDERATION OF TEACHERS<br/>Proposal May 14, 2014 5:35 p.m.</p>
<p>Salary and Benefit Compensation Agreement Between<br/>Salinas Union High School District</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Salinas Valley Federation of Teachers</p>
<p>The Salinas Union High School District (District) and Salinas<br/>Valley Federation of Teachers (SVFT), jointly referred to as the<br/>&quot;Parties&quot;, agree to the following compensation formula:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new monthly maximum District contribution for health<br/>insurance premium costs (caps) shall be increased by $31.78<br/>per month effective March 30, 2012 and shall not exceed the<br/>following amounts:</p>
<p>7-12 Certificated: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$776;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee +1 =</p>
<p>$1,072; and Family = $1,474.</p>
<p>Adult School Cert: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$785;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee +1 =</p>
<p>$1,081; and Family = $1,483.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Formula On or before June 1 of each school year,<br/>beginning with June 1, 2014, the District and SVFT will review<br/>the prior year step and column percentage cost and the total<br/>percentage increase or decrease to the District's total net<br/>base revenue funding* for the current year and adjust the<br/>current salary schedule by that percentage. Should this<br/>review show an increase in the District's net base revenue ,<br/>the current year's step and column percentage cost for the<br/>bargaining unit shall be deducted from the percentage increase<br/>and the resulting percentage increase shall be applied to<br/>increase the current salary schedules (7-12, Adult Education,<br/>Hourly Rate, Summer School Rate, fixed dollar extra-duty<br/>stipends and Substitute Daily Rate) and/or increase the<br/>District's health insurance contribution as may be negotiated<br/>between the Parties. The calculation of step and column costs<br/>from one year to the next shall include savings from<br/>retirement and replacement and shall include any increase in<br/>costs of benefits for retirees including any early retirement<br/>incentives not currently in effect under the terms of the</p>
<p>173/179</p>
<p>collective bargaining agreement. The Parties shall meet,<br/>review and agree upon the calculation of step and column<br/>costs. If the District anticipates that the calculation may<br/>result in a negative percentage, the Parties shall commence<br/>negotiations on compensation within thirty (30) days of notice<br/>by the District to SVFT. In the event that State law requires<br/>any categorical funds or concentration and supplemental grant<br/>funds be moved to the calculation of the District's net base<br/>revenue when the District is still mandated to operate those<br/>programs, this formula shall be suspended and the Parties<br/>shall, within thirty (30) days, begin negotiations allowing<br/>the parties to resolve any issues concerning the exclusion of<br/>such monies from the net base revenue. This suspension shall<br/>not, however, effect the entitlement of the bargaining unit to<br/>monies other than categorical funds or concentration and<br/>supplemental grant funds. The Parties agree to expedite<br/>negotiations with the purpose of reaching an agreement within<br/>sixty (60) days of the commencement of these limited<br/>negotiations to implement any new formula language for the<br/>following fiscal year.</p>
<p>* This language is intended to reflect the new Local Control<br/>Funding Formula (&quot;LCFF&quot;) and &quot;base revenue&quot; is intended to<br/>mean only the LCFF base grant and excludes any categorical<br/>funds and supplemental and concentration grant funds.</p>

This agreement becomes effective on July<br/>1<sup>st</sup>, 2009.</p>
<p>The parties have agreed to the following;</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school year assignment for full-time TSA will be 194 flex days per year<br/>(July-June), with the exception of those assigned as site TSAs. All employees in<br/>this category will be placed on the regular<sup>4</sup> teaching salary.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teachers selected for a full-time TSA will have a right to return to a similar<br/>position in the District as the one he/she held prior to the selection.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a full-time TSA position becomes available in the District, such position<br/>will be posted ditrict-widc for a minimum period of five working days. If the<br/>vacancy occurs during the summer months, an e-mail to all certificated employees<br/>will be generated. The posting and/ or e-mail will include a brief description of<br/>the job, a deadline when to apply, information on how to apply and who to<br/>address the application. At the conclusion of the application period, HR will be<br/>responsible to collect all applications submitted, based on the instructions given,<br/>and will coordinate the interview process.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interviewing panel will be formed consisting of two (2) members representing<br/>SVFT and two (2) members representing the District.

The panel will then submit the name of<br/>the finalist to the Associate Superintendent of Educational Services for final<br/>selection.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TSA assignment wilt be for no more than three (3) years or less based on<br/>funding availability and the needs of the District. An evaluation of the TSA will<br/>be conducted every year to determine if the teachers selected should continue in<br/>such position. A teacher servings as a TSA may apply to a second three (3) term<br/>at the conclusion of his/her first three (3) years in the position. In the event that a<br/>person is selected for a second three (3) year term, the participating teacher must<br/>return to a classroom position for a period of three (3) years before he/she can be<br/>considered again as a TSA.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a partial TSA position at a site becomes available, such position will be<br/>posted at that site for a minimum period of three working days. If the vacancy<br/>occurs during the summer months, an e-mail to all certificated employees at that<br/>site will be generated by the site secretary. The posting or e-mail will include a</p>
<p>brief description of the job. Applicants must submit their applications to the site<br/>principal who will conduct interviews and submit a recommendation to the<br/>Associate Superintendent of Human Resources. Partial TSA positions at a site<br/>will be for that particular school year when a position becomes available. In the<br/>event the site would like to continue to offer a partial TSA, the process of<br/>application and selection must take place every year.</p>
<p>7) Current TSAs: The sub-committee agreed to continue the following full-time<br/>Teacher-On-Special Assignments: New Teacher Support Specialist (BTSA).
