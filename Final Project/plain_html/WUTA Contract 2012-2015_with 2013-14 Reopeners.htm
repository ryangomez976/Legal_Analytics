<p>7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this procedure is to attempt to secure equitable solutions</p>
<p>to grievances at the lowest possible administrative level. Both parties<br/>agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as<br/>may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible,</p>
<p>the time limit specified at each level shall be considered to be<br/>maximums, and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The<br/>time limits may be extended, however, by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>7.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such a time that it cannot be processed</p>
<p>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year and if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school<br/>year could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth</p>

<p>through at least the informal discussion with his/her immediate<br/>supervisor prior to initiating a formalized grievance proceeding<br/>hereinafter described. Adjustment of a grievance through such an<br/>informal discussion may be accomplished without the intervention of the<br/>Association. However, the aggrieved person may at his/her discretion be<br/>represented by the Association in any such infoimal discussion.</p>
