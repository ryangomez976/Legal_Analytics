<p>yearly.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial salary placement will be determined in the following manner.</p>
<p>4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 2007, bargaining unit members employed with outside experience will be given<br/>year-for-year credit up to eleven years. A teacher employed with eleven or more years of<br/>outside teaching experience will be placed on step 12 of the Teachers’ Salary Schedule.

<p>4.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members initially employed with 75% or more of a year of service credit are<br/>given credit for a full year of service. Bargaining unit members initially employed with less than<br/>75% of a year of service credit are not given credit for that year of service. This initial<br/>placement, and not the percent thereof, will serve as the base number for any future service<br/>credit.</p>
<p>4.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitute service does not count toward years of service credit.</p>
<p>4.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who return to the District within 39 months from their date of resignation are placed<br/>on the salary schedule at the point reached when the resignation occurred. If the employee<br/>gained outside teaching experience within the 39 months, their prior district experience shall be<br/>combined with the experience obtained outside the District. Employees who return to the<br/>district outside of the 39-month window are placed on the salary schedule with the same<br/>consideration as a new employee to the District.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary advancement will be determined in the following manner:</p>
<p>4.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 1998, full-time employees must work a minimum of 135 instructional days in<br/>order to receive service credit for salary placement purposes. Part-time employees must work a<br/>minimum of 75% of the instructional days of their contract year in order to receive service credit<br/>for salary placement purposes. As clarification, full-time employees who work 134 3/4 days<br/>(one hundred thirty-four and three-fourths days) will not receive service credit for salary<br/>placement purposes. Service credit for part-time employees will be calculated in the same<br/>manner. Days of paid sick leave (not including differential pay) shall be counted as work days<br/>for salary placement purposes.</p>
<p>4.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service credit for part-time employees accumulates by adding the percentage of contract<br/>worked, i.e. an employee who works a 75% contract for three years will accumulate 2.25 years<br/>of service credit. When part time service reaches 75% or more, the employee is advanced to<br/>the next highest step on the salary schedule. Part-time experience will continue to accumulate<br/>based on the actual percent of service credit. This provision excludes reduced work load<br/>employees under Section 20.3.2.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>4.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective August 1, 1995, days of paid sick leave (not including differential pay) will be counted<br/>as days of work. Employees whose salary placement will be affected by this change will be<br/>compensated for the differences beginning with the 1996-97 school year. Therefore, a change<br/>experienced during the 1995-96 school year will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>4.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective August 1, 1980, an employee whose contract changes during the year will be given<br/>service credit for the greater contract if they work at least one full semester or more than 50% of<br/>the year at the greater contract percentage. Employees whose salary placement will be<br/>affected by this change will be compensated for the difference beginning with the 2000-2001<br/>school year. Therefore, a salary placement change prior to the 2000-2001 school year will not<br/>be reimbursed or compensated.</p>
<p>4.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will be placed in accordance with their years of service credit and semester units<br/>beyond a bachelor’s degree. However, an employee may only be placed on a longevity step<br/>after serving one full year at Step F-13.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2001, employees with be placed in accordance with their years of service credit<br/>and semester units beyond a bachelor’s degree. An employee who has acquired sufficient<br/>years of service and semester units to be placed beyond Step F-13 will be placed at the<br/>appropriate step without having to serve one year at Step F-13.</p>
<p>4.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of credentials, permit or credential waiver held by the employee will not adversely<br/>affect salary advancement. This includes, but is not limited to, intern, emergency, clear<br/>professional and preliminary credentials.</p>

<p>17</p>
<p>9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee requesting a transfer shall then submit the completed transfer request form to the<br/>employee’s immediate supervisor for signature. This submission (to the immediate supervisor) can be<br/>done electronically, as long as the required district form is completed and this electronic submission is<br/>attached to the form. Such signature shall be solely an acknowledgement that the immediate supervisor<br/>has been informed of the employee’s desire for transfer.</p>
<p>9.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known vacancies within a school year, which occur after October 1st and prior to the last school day of<br/>that school year, shall be posted for ten (10) working days.

<p>Section 3 - Involuntary Transfer</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer initiated by the administration shall be completed only after the appropriate district<br/>administrator has discussed the transfer with the affected employee.

<p>9.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a choice of positions is possible, the employee may indicate an order of preference. If two or<br/>more employees transferred involuntarily request the same assignment, the one best qualified in the<br/>judgment of the appropriate district administrator in consultation with the appropriate administrative<br/>staff, shall be recommended. Seniority and a teacher’s scheduling needs shall be two of the many<br/>factors weighed by the District when transfers are being considered, in addition, the parties will abide<br/>by the MOU signed on April 21, 2010 regarding involuntary transfers within a particular kind of service<br/>during an established layoff period.</p>
<p>9.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No involuntary transfer shall be arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or punitive.</p>

<p>12. EVALUATION</p>
<p>Section 1 - Procedures for Teacher Evaluation</p>
<p>12.1.1 The chief responsibility for formal employee evaluation shall be that of each building principal or<br/>designee; however, this responsibility shall be shared with the District Superintendent or his/her<br/>management or supervisory designee.

<p>12.1.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evaluator and the unit member mutually agree, permanent employees will<br/>be evaluated every five years (evaluation will occur during the 5<sup>th</sup> year) if he or<br/>she meets the following criteria:</p>
<p>12.1.2.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has worked in the District for ten consecutive years.</p>

<p>12.1.2.2.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has received a “meets or exceeds district standards”<br/>in each area on their last two evaluations.</p>
<p>12.1.2.2.4 Should an administrator determine that there is need to evaluate an employee<br/>during a non-designated year, the employee is to be notified in writing of the<br/>evaluation and of the reasons for the change. The administrator shall meet and<br/>confer with the employee by December 1 and discuss the topics listed in 12.1.4<br/>below.

<p>12.1.5 The evaluator meeting with the unit member, as outlined in paragraphs 12.1.3 and 12.1.4 shall be the<br/>same evaluator who completes the final evaluation. The designated evaluator shall have the primary</p>
<p>responsibility for compiling all observations of the unit member including those done by other<br/>administrators. If a unit member disagrees with any part or the entire observation made by an observer<br/>other than the evaluator, a request for a meeting involving the observer, evaluator and the member<br/>shall be granted.</p>
<p>12.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a disagreement over the objectives, standards and/or evaluation schedule, the unit<br/>member and the evaluator shall:</p>
<p>12.1.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make good faith effort to resolve the differences themselves.</p>
<p>12.1.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the disagreement persists, the parties may invite a third party (who may be a<br/>representative of the Association) to assist in resolving the differences. The third party shall<br/>recommend alternatives to the unit member and evaluator.</p>
<p>12.1.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either the unit member or evaluator rejects the proposed alternatives, each shall have the<br/>opportunity to state his/her position on the matter(s) in dispute, and to have a written<br/>statement attached to the evaluation form.</p>
<p>12.1.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have the right to identify any constraints, which the unit member<br/>believes may inhibit his/her ability to meet the objectives and standards established.</p>
<p>12.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation year, circumstances may change which require modification of the<br/>original objectives and standards. The unit member may initiate a change of objectives and standards.</p>
<p>12.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For permanent successful teachers, the number of observations by the evaluator shall normally be four<br/>per year, unless the evaluator determines that fewer or more are needed. One scheduled observation<br/>must be completed by the evaluator. For probationary teachers or teachers with an identified<br/>deficiency the number of observations will usually be greater. Evaluation shall not be based solely on<br/>unscheduled observations.</p>
<p>12.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Scheduled” observations shall include:</p>
<p>12.1.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length as established under 12.1.4 above.</p>
<p>12.1.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two (2) days prior notification.</p>
<p>12.1.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Unscheduled” observations shall include:</p>
<p>12.1.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length as established under number 12.1.4 above.</p>
<p>12.1.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator’s determination of date/time.</p>
<p>12.1.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee’s evaluation indicates that there are deficiencies, a reasonable period of time shall be<br/>given to correct them. The employee shall also be given direction and assistance designed to help<br/>in correcting each deficiency covered by the evaluation.</p>
<p>12.1.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations shall be based on observations of the employee and upon such other factors as affect<br/>the operation and welfare of the educational program. No overall unsatisfactory rating maybe given<br/>on the final evaluation unless at least one area of deficiency has been identified and reported in<br/>writing to the employee. The evaluator shall be excused from this requirement if the area of<br/>deficiency is manifested immediately prior to the presentation of the final evaluation.</p>
<p>12.1.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be held accountable for any aspect of the educational program, which he/she<br/>has neither the duty nor the responsibility to carry out.</p>
<p>12.1.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written evaluation shall be prepared by the evaluator and presented to the unit member no later<br/>than thirty (30) days prior to the last day of school. An evaluation conference between the unit</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>member and the evaluator shall be held no later than the last day of school. In the event the unit<br/>member disputes the content, the unit member may prepare a written statement, which shall be<br/>attached and incorporated into the final evaluation.</p>
<p>12.1.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding Consulting Teachers and Referred Participating Teachers in the PAR program, unit<br/>members shall not be required to participate in the evaluation(s) and/or observations of other unit<br/>members unless the unit member being evaluated consents.</p>
<p>12.1.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall receive a signed and dated copy of written observations, usually within ten (10)<br/>working days.</p>
<p>12.1.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evaluation shall be conducted in a manner, which is arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, or<br/>punitive.</p>

A copy of the instruments used for the evaluation of teachers,<br/>counselors, psychologists, and school nurses are attached as Appendix D, E, F, and G, respectively.<br/>District Standards attached as Appendix H.</p>
<p>12.1.19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that some unit members and their evaluators wish to reflect upon, evaluate and<br/>enhance a unit member’s performance using an alternative assessment model. By mutual<br/>agreement between the unit member and evaluator, traditional observation/assessment may be<br/>replaced by techniques agreed upon between the two parties. If the two parties elect to use an<br/>alternative assessment model and either party determines, at a later date, that the use of this model<br/>is inappropriate, the traditional assessment process will be used. Barring the exceptions noted for<br/>section 12.1.18, nothing in this section shall remove the evaluator’s responsibility to meet all<br/>requirements of this article.</p>
<p>12.1.20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are required to sign all evaluations. The employee’s signature does not necessarily<br/>indicate agreement with the evaluation, but rather that they have reviewed the evaluation.<br/>Employees are to receive a copy of their evaluations.</p>
<p>12.1.21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request a conference with the principal or designee and the Superintendent or<br/>designees when unsatisfactory ratings have been given. The conference shall be of sufficient length<br/>to cover the concerns of all parties taking part in the conference.</p>
<p>Section 2 - Expected Levels of Performance</p>
<p>12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee evaluation shall be based upon the requirements of the specific job description for the</p>
<p>position to which he or she is assigned.</p>

<p>23</p>
<p>12.2.2.7 The establishment and maintenance of proper control and a suitable learning environment to<br/>the extent possible under existing conditions.</p>
<p>12.2.3 The “pupil learning” section of the evaluation form shall not be based solely on any single measure of<br/>student achievement.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Public Complaints</p>
<p>12.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative and/or unsatisfactory evaluation shall be predicated upon information or material of a<br/>derogatory or critical nature, which has been received by the evaluator from students, parents, and/or<br/>individuals unless the following procedures have been followed:</p>
<p>12.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a complaint is deemed to have substance, it shall be reported to the unit member by<br/>his/her supervisor within 15 working days unless dictated otherwise by law enforcement.</p>
<p>12.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the involved unit member and/or the administrator believe the allegations in the<br/>complaint warrant a meeting, the immediate supervisor or designee shall attempt to schedule<br/>a meeting between the unit member and the complainant. At the request of the unit member,<br/>an Association representative shall be present at the meeting. It is recognized that a<br/>complainant may not desire to attend the meeting; if this occurs, there will be a discussion<br/>between the responsible administrator and the employee.</p>
<p>12.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints which are anonymous, withdrawn, or shown to be without substance shall neither be placed<br/>in the unit member’s personnel file nor used in any evaluation or disciplinary action against the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>12.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter of reprimand resulting from a student, parent, or individual complaint shall not be written before<br/>the involved unit member has been given the opportunity to meet with the administrator and discuss the<br/>complaint.</p>

<p>APPENDIX I</p>
<p>INITIAL SALARY PLACEMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members employed with outside experience will be given year-for-year<br/>credit up to nine years. A teacher employed with nine or more years of outside teaching<br/>experience will be placed on step 10 of the Teachers’ Salary Schedule. This experience<br/>must have been obtained within thirteen (13) years immediately preceding employment<br/>by Lincoln Unified School District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members initially employed with 75% or more of a year of service credit<br/>are given credit for a full year of service. Bargaining unit members initially employed<br/>with less than 75% of a year of service credit are not given credit for that year of service.<br/>This initial placement, and not the percent thereof, will serve as the base number for any<br/>future service credit.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitute service does not count towards years of service credit.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who return to the District within 39 months from their date of resignation are<br/>placed on the salary schedule at the point reached when the resignation occurred. If the<br/>employee gained outside teaching experience within the 39 months, their prior district<br/>experience shall be combined with the experience obtained outside the District.</p>
<p>Employees who return to the District outside the 39-month window are placed on the<br/>salary schedule with the same consideration as a new employee to the District.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to August 1, 1997, any employee who was offered an initial salary placement<br/>inconsistent with the Contract and for which written documentation exists to verify that<br/>an actual offer was made, not an error, will be y-rated (the salary in effect at the time of<br/>notification will be maintained until the correct salary schedule placement meets or<br/>exceeds that level).</p>
<p>SALARY ADVANCEMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 1998, full-time employees must work a minimum of 135 instructional<br/>days in order to receive service credit for salary placement purposes. Part-time<br/>employees must work a minimum of 75% of the instructional days of their contract year<br/>in order to receive service credit for salary placement purposes. As clarification, full-time<br/>employees who work, 134 3/4 days (one hundred thirty-four and three-fourths days) will<br/>not receive service credit for salary placement purposes. Service credit for part-time<br/>employees will be calculated in the same manner. Days of paid sick leave (not including<br/>differential pay) shall be counted as workdays for salary placement purposes.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service credit for part-time employees accumulates by adding the percentage of contract<br/>worked, i.e. an employee who works a 75% contract for three years will accumulate 2.25<br/>year of service credit. When part-time service reaches 75% or more, the employee is<br/>advanced to the next highest step on the salary schedule. Part-time experience will<br/>continue to accumulate based on the actual percent of service credit. This provision<br/>excludes reduced workload employees under Article XXI, Section 20.3.2. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective August 1, 1995, days of paid sick leave (not including differential pay) will be<br/>counted as days of work. Employees whose salary placement will be affected by this<br/>change will be compensated for the differences beginning with the 1996-97 school year.<br/>Therefore, a change experienced during the 1995-96 school year will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective August 1, 1980, an employee whose contract changes during the year will only<br/>be given service credit for the greater contact if they work at least one full semester or<br/>more than 50% of the year at the greater contract percentage. Employees whose salary<br/>placement will be affected by this change will be compensated for the difference<br/>beginning with the 2000-2001 school year. Therefore, a salary placement change prior<br/>to the 2000-2001 school year will not be reimbursed or compensated.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will be placed in accordance with their years of service credit and semester<br/>units beyond a bachelor’s degree. However, an employee may only be place on a<br/>longevity step after serving one full year at Step F-13.</p>
<p>Effective July 1,2001, employees will be placed in accordance with their years of service<br/>credit and semester units beyond a bachelor’s degree. An employee who has acquired<br/>sufficient years of service and semester units to be placed beyond Step F-13 will be<br/>placed at the appropriate step without having to serve one year at Step F-13.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of credentials or credential waiver held by the employee will not adversely<br/>affect salary advancement. (This includes, but is not limited to, intern, emergency, clear<br/>professional and preliminary credentials).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>APPENDIX J<br/>Longevity</p>
<p>The current practice is not to allow service credit outside the District granted at the time of initial<br/>hire to count towards the longevity steps of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>LUTA and the District have agreed to the following adjusted schedule/Schedule A, for moving<br/>certificated staff, defined below, with service credit outside the District to the first longevity step,</p>
<p>i.e., year one of Step F-16. This agreement will apply to part-time and full-time staff initially<br/>hired after November 3, 1983. Part-time staff hired before November 3, 1983, currently placed<br/>at Step 13 who have already served more than the equivalent of three full-time years at Step 13,<br/>will be advanced to year one of Step 16. Part-time staff hired before November 3, 1983, who<br/>has not yet reached Step 13, will serve the equivalent of three full-time years at Step 13.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the District shall not fund advancement, to any longevity steps for staff<br/>that are currently placed on Step F-16 or above with service credit outside the District.<br/>Schedule A has the effect of changing the initial salary placement solely for purposes of<br/>determining eligibility for the first longevity step. Schedule A will allow staff currently placed on<br/>Step F-13 and who have been placed at F-13 for more than 3 full-time years, or the equivalent,<br/>to move to year 1 of Step F-16 and will insure that in the future, unit members will not remain at<br/>Step F-13 for more than 3 full-time years, or the part-time equivalent to three full years, of<br/>satisfactory service. The District believes that by this modification of longevity rules, it will be<br/>able to attract more experienced teachers to working the District. LUTA/CTA/NEA will not bring<br/>action to invalidate this agreement. If LUTA/CTA/NEA participates in or supports a suit or other<br/>legal action to invalidate this adjusted schedule, LUTA agrees that they will indemnify the<br/>District for any loss or damages it suffers as a result of such legal action. The District<br/>acknowledges that teachers with LUTA/CTA/NEA membership are entitled to legal counsel as a<br/>benefit of membership. LUTA/CTA/NEA will not be held in violation of this agreement if a<br/>person individually brings legal action against the District so long as the legal action is not<br/>funded by LUTA/CTA/NEA.</p>
<p>The following provisions apply to employees whose service to the District has been in a full-time<br/>capacity. Years of service for determining placement and advancement on the salary schedule<br/>for part-time employees shall be calculated according to Appendix H of the contract.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee was hired on November 3, 1983 or earlier, no outside service credit will<br/>count towards longevity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee whose first full year of district service was the 1984-1985 school year and<br/>is currently frozen, at F-13 will receive one year of outside service credit towards<br/>longevity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee whose first full year of district service was the 1985-1986 school year and<br/>is currently frozen at F-13 will receive two years of outside service credit towards<br/>longevity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee whose first full year of district service was the 1986-1987 school year and<br/>is currently frozen at F-13 will receive three years of outside service credit towards<br/>longevity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee whose first full year of district service was the 1987-1988 school year and<br/>is currently frozen at F-13 will receive four years of outside service credit towards<br/>longevity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee whose first full year of district service was the 1988-1989 school year and<br/>is currently frozen at F-13 will receive five years of outside service credit towards<br/>longevity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee whose first full year of district service was the 1989-1990 school year and<br/>is currently frozen at F-13 will receive six years of outside service credit towards<br/>longevity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee whose first full year of district service was the 1990-1991 school year or<br/>more recently, will receive up to six years of outside service credit towards longevity.</p>
