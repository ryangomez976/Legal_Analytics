</table>
<p>5</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year End Grievances</p>
<p>In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all the<br/>steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school year, and if left unresolved<br/>until the beginning of the following school year could result in irreparable harm to a party<br/>in interest, the time limits set forth herein shall be reduced so that the grievance<br/>procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon thereafter as is<br/>practicable.</p>
<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1 - Principal, Immediate Supervisor, or District Administrator</p>
<p>A member of the unit with a grievance shall discuss the alleged violation of the<br/>Agreement informally with his/her principal or immediate supervisor with the objective<br/>of resolving the matter.

<p>Either party may request a meeting during this level.</p>
<p>6.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3 - Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with disposition of grievance at Level 2, or if no<br/>decision has been rendered within ten (10) school days after the grievance was delivered<br/>to the Superintendent, the grievant may, within five (5) school days after a decision by<br/>the Superintendent or fifteen (15) school days after the grievance was delivered to the<br/>Superintendent, whichever is sooner, request in writing to the Association that the<br/>grievance be submitted to binding arbitration. The Association shall retain the right to<br/>determine which grievances may proceed to arbitration, and will notify the district within<br/>fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Superintendent’s response or last date of required<br/>response.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) school days after such written notice from the Association of<br/>submission to binding arbitration, the Board and the Association shall attempt to agree<br/>upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator and shall obtain a commitment from said arbitrator<br/>to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator or to obtain such a<br/>commitment within the specified period, a request for a list of arbitrators may be made to<br/>the American Arbitration Association by either party.

<p>6.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Award of Arbitrator</p>
<p>The award of the arbitrator shall be binding upon the Association and the Board. The<br/>arbitrator is restricted to make whole settlements.

The notice shall include a statement to notify<br/>prospective applicants of the STRS limitations on such employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list will be generated from those that volunteer and that list will be retained in the<br/>Principal’s Office for at least 3 years. A new list will be established at the beginning of<br/>each year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers will be selected from the list based upon possession of the appropriate<br/>credential(s), ability of the site master schedule to accommodate the section, experience<br/>of the teacher in that subject matter area, and other criteria stated by the site principal in<br/>the notice.</p>

In the event a qualified teacher is<br/>found during the semester, the contract will be cancelled immediately. These conditions<br/>of employment will be explained to all teachers who are offered extra sections.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the parties that such sections be used to accommodate unexpected<br/>growth, shortages in difficult to find subject areas, and short-term district needs. It is not<br/>the intent that it be used to supplant the need for additional staffing.</p>

The annual evening parent conference shall last no more than 2 Zi hours.<br/>(Note: Language requiring a second set of conferences was removed. As an unintended<br/>consequence, this language locks in the date and prevents flexibility in scheduling the<br/>conferences. Parties are willing to work together to set the conference dates, which may<br/>occur during first quarter.)</p>

Payment shall be at a rate determined by the following formula:</p>
<p>The amount in the current salary schedule on Column IV, Step 7 divided by the number<br/>of traditional year contracted working days multiplied by the percentage of the<br/>preparation period in the day at that site. For example:</p>
<p>* High School: ((Column IV, step 7)/171) x 0.20= per period amount<br/>*Middle School: ((Column IV, step 7)/171) x 0.1667= per period amount</p>
<p>Compensating time off shall be accrued and granted at the rate of one (1) day off for each<br/>six (6) periods at the High School level (or teaching period equivalent in Alternative<br/>School Programs) and each seven (7) periods at the Middle School.</p>
<p>Use of the compensating time must be with prior approval of the principal or program<br/>manager and the prior approval may be restricted depending upon the availability of<br/>substitutes and for continuity of the Academic Program. Accrued time not used by the<br/>end of the school year, shall be converted into payment by the above formula and shall<br/>not be carried over into the next year.</p>

<p>8.12 CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREATION</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to create the Catastrophic Leave Bank effective<br/>July 1, 2001. The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be funded in accordance with the terms<br/>of Section B. below.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall accumulate from year to year. Such leave<br/>does not accrue to any individual member.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank without regard to the<br/>daily rate of pay of the Catastrophic Leave Bank participant.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TUT A Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by a three (3) member<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee appointed by the President of the Association.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make a onetime contribution of $20,000 to the Bank prior to its<br/>inception to add to the employee contributions. The District’s contribution, which is<br/>converted to a number of usable days, shall be utilized in any year when the employee-<br/>contributed days are depleted.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY AND CONTRIBUTIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members on active duty with the District are eligible to contribute to the TUTA<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires contribution to the Bank. Only contributors will<br/>be permitted to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first becoming<br/>eligible have a waiting period of sixty (60) days after joining the Bank before becoming<br/>eligible to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution, on the appropriate form, will be authorized by the unit member and<br/>continued from year to year until cancelled by the unit member or modified by the Bank<br/>committee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation occurs automatically whenever a unit member fails to make his/her annual<br/>contribution or assessment. Cancellation, on the proper form, may be effected at any<br/>time and the unit member shall not be eligible to draw from the Bank as of the effective<br/>date of cancellation. Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to the Bank shall<br/>not be returned if the unit member effects cancellation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each school year. Unit<br/>members returning from extended leave which included the enrollment period and new<br/>hires will be permitted to contribute within thirty (30) calendar days of beginning work.<br/>The District shall supply enrollment forms for the Catastrophic Leave Bank to all new<br/>unit members and those unit members returning from leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of contribution by each participating unit member for the first year shall be one<br/>(1) day, (6.5 hours), of sick leave, which shall be deemed to equate to the legal minimum<br/>required by Education Code Section 44043.5 . Contributions thereafter shall be<br/>determined by the Committee.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional contribution will be required of participants if the number of days in the<br/>Bank falls below one hundred fifty (150). Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are<br/>drawing from the Bank at the time of the assessment will not be required to contribute to<br/>remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a Catastrophic Leave Bank participant has no<br/>remaining sick leave at the time of the assessment, they need not contribute the additional<br/>day to remain a participant in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days in the Bank at the beginning of a school year exceeds five<br/>hundred (500), no contribution shall be required of returning unit members. Those unit<br/>members joining the Catastrophic Leave Bank for the first time and those returning from<br/>leave shall be required to contribute one (1) day to the Bank.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are retiring or leaving the employ of the District may contribute any<br/>or all of their unused sick leave to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 31 of each school year, the total contribution of participating unit members<br/>will be placed in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All contributions to the Bank are irrevocable.</p>
<p>C. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BANK</p>
<p>1. Catastrophic Leave Bank participants, whose sick leave is exhausted, may withdraw from<br/>the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury subject to the limitations below.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2006 the Association defines “Catastrophic” in accordance with<br/>Webster’s Dictionary (1993) as a “momentous, tragic, sudden event marked by effects</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>ranging from extreme misfortune to disaster.” The Catastrophic Leave Bank is not<br/>intended to be used for maternity leave.</p>
<p>To qualify for withdrawal for the Bank, a catastrophic illness or injury must be one that<br/>incapacitates the unit member for over ten (10) consecutive duty days or incapacitates a<br/>member of the unit member’s family for over ten (10) consecutive days which requires<br/>the unit member to take time off work to care for that family member.</p>
<p>A duty day as used in this article shall be any day the unit member’s school or assigned<br/>track is in session. If a reoccurrence or a second illness or injury incapacitates a unit<br/>member or member of the unit member’s family within twelve (12) months, it shall be<br/>deemed catastrophic after five (5) consecutive duty days. Thus, a participant who used<br/>the Bank after exhaustion of sick leave for twenty-five (25) days to care for his wife who<br/>dies of cancer and, after returning to work, suffers a heart attack shall be deemed to have<br/>a second catastrophic illness and may again withdraw from the Bank after only five (5)<br/>consecutive duty days off work.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must use all sick leave (but not differential leave) as defined in Article 8.2<br/>available to them before eligible for a withdrawal from the Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants who have exhausted sick leave but still have differential leave available are<br/>eligible for a withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The District shall pay the<br/>participant full pay and the Bank shall be charged forty percent (40%) of the day.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten (10) duty days of illness or disability must be covered by the participant’s<br/>own sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay the first time said participant<br/>qualifies for a withdrawal from the Bank. For subsequent withdrawals, within twelve (12)<br/>consecutive months, the first five (5) duty days of illness must be covered by the<br/>participant’s own sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant is incapacitated, the participant’s agent or member of the participant’s<br/>family may submit applications to the Committee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of no more than<br/>thirty (30) duty days. Participants may submit requests for extensions of withdrawals as<br/>their prior grants expire. A participant’s withdrawal from the Bank may not exceed the<br/>statutory maximum period of six (6) consecutive months.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank will be required to submit a doctor’s statement, which includes verification<br/>of the need for catastrophic leave. Members of the Committee shall keep all medical<br/>information regarding the nature of the illness confidential.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant has drawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank days and requests an<br/>extension, the Committee may require a medical review by a physician of the<br/>Committee’s choice at the participant’s expense. The Committee shall choose only a<br/>physician who qualifies under the District offered insurance policy. Refusal to submit to<br/>the medical review will terminate the participant’s continued withdrawal from the Bank.<br/>The Committee may deny an extension of withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>based upon the medical report. The participant may appeal any termination under the<br/>procedures outlined in Section 13 below.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualify the<br/>participant for Worker’s Compensation benefits unless the participant has exhausted all</p>
<p>Worker’s Compensation leave, his/her own sick leave, and provided further that the<br/>member signs over any Worker’s Compensation checks for temporary benefits to the<br/>District. Catastrophic leave shall be available to unit members with industrial illness and<br/>accident leave only after exhaustion of statutory industrial illness leave and exhaustion of<br/>accumulated sick leave. If the District challenges the Worker’s Compensation claim, the<br/>participant may draw from the Bank but, upon settlement of the claim, the Bank shall be<br/>reimbursed the appropriate number of days by the District.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal<br/>request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide days and the District is under no<br/>obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If the Committee denies a request<br/>for withdrawal or an extension of withdrawal because of insufficient days to fund the<br/>request, they shall notify the participant, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the exhaustion of sick leave or the<br/>waiting periods provided for in Sections B.3 and C.4, whichever is greater. For example,<br/>if a participant contributed when first eligible to contribute (Section B) and had ten (10)<br/>days of accumulated sick leave when the illness began (Section C), he/she shall begin<br/>withdrawing upon the eleventh (11th) duty day if otherwise eligible. If the participant<br/>had fifteen (15) days of sick leave at the beginning of the illness, he/she shall begin<br/>withdrawing days on the sixteenth duty day. If the participant had five (5) days of sick<br/>leave at the beginning of the illness, he/she shall begin withdrawing days on the eleventh<br/>(11th) duty day.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are denied a withdrawal or whose withdrawal<br/>is not renewed or terminated may, within thirty (30) days of denial, appeal, in writing, to<br/>the Executive Board of the Association. The Executive Board of the Association shall<br/>hold a hearing within fifteen (15) duty days. The Executive Board shall issue a<br/>confidential written decision within fifteen (15) duty days of the hearing. The Executive<br/>Board’s decision is final and nongrievable. If the participant’s incapacitation does not<br/>allow participation in this appeal process, the participant’s agent or member of the family<br/>may process the appeal.</p>
<p>D. ADMINISTRATION OF THE BANK</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee shall have the responsibility of maintaining the<br/>records of the Catastrophic Leave Bank by receiving withdrawal request, verifying the<br/>validity of requests, approving or denying the requests, and communicating its decisions,<br/>in writing, to the participants and to the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the Bank. The<br/>Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests complying with the terms of this<br/>article.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications shall be reviewed and decisions of the Committee reported to the applicant,<br/>in writing, within ten (10) duty days of receipt of the application.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose the nature of the<br/>illness except as is necessary to process the request for withdrawal and defend against<br/>any appeals of denials.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each fiscal quarter, the District shall notify the committee of the following:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of day in the Bank at the beginning of the previous month.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days added to the Bank by new participants or people returning from<br/>leaves.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days awarded during the previous month and to whom they were<br/>awarded.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days remaining in the Bank on the last day of the month.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute between the Committee and the District as to the accounting of Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank days shall be immediately submitted to Binding Arbitration without the need<br/>to follow earlier steps of the grievance procedure as per Article 6.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the<br/>Bank shall be returned to the then current members of the Bank proportionately.</p>

In classes that exceed the maximum, the following<br/>procedure shall be used:</p>
<p>9.7.1 School Reassignment</p>
<p>The District Administration may reassign students to other schools in the District if such<br/>reassignment would bring the affected class(es) to within the maximum class size limits<br/>and such action is deemed advisable by the principal.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>9.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining Classes</p>
<p>Combination classes may be established by the principal if this procedure will bring the<br/>affected class(es) within the maximum class size limits at the applicable grade levels.</p>

<p>When class sizes are exceeded and none of the procedures in 9.7.1 and 9.7.2 are feasible,<br/>the principal shall discuss the problem with teachers of the affected classes and explore<br/>alternative approaches to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>9.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After exhaustion of 9.7, 9.7.1, 9.7.2, and 9.7.3, the following procedure shall apply:<br/>Elementary:</p>
<p>Classroom teachers will receive $25.00 a day compensation per student for each student<br/>over the class size maximum after the first 15 school days. The additional compensation<br/>begins on the first day that the class size is over the maximum and continues until class<br/>size drops within the class size maximum. No individual class shall be exceeded by two<br/>students over the contract maximum.</p>
<p>Compensation for support staff (library, music, P.E.) will be made on a pro-rata basis.</p>
<p>The total amount of money available to be 9% of the total paid to the classroom teachers<br/>each semester to be figured separately for each school.</p>
<p>Secondary:</p>
<p>Classroom teachers will receive $8.00 per day compensation per student per period over<br/>the class size maximum after the first 15 school days. The additional compensation<br/>begins on the first day that the class size is over the maximum and continues until class<br/>size drops within the class size maximum. The class size shall not exceed two students<br/>over the contract maximum. Teachers are not eligible for additional compensation for<br/>both per class and total daily student contact in excess of the maximum set forth in this<br/>article. Instead, teachers shall receive additional compensation based on which<br/>calculation—per class or student contact—yields the most additional compensation.</p>
<p>There will be no limit on the number of students exceeding total daily student contacts,<br/>unlike the current individual class limit of two (2) students over the contract maximum.</p>
<p>9.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting and Filling of Vacancies/New Positions</p>
<p>The timelines for posting and filling vacancies/new positions created under this article<br/>shall be five days.</p>
<p>9.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolution After March 15</p>
<p>When the class size maximums noted in 9.1 - 9.4 are exceeded after March 15, the<br/>District shall compensate the unit members at the rates set forth in Section 9.7.4.<br/>Grievances shall not be filed after this date.</p>
<p>9.7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrap Up Language</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the third student over the class size maximum, and the failure of Sections</p>
<p>9.7.1 - 9.7.3 to yield a solution, the affected teacher may file a grievance. Any solution to<br/>the grievance must be fiscally sound.</p>

<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINIMUM PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT</p>

<p>ARTICLE 18<br/>SALARY AND FRINGE BENEFITS</p>
<p>AGREEMENTS ON SALARY:</p>
<p>As per May 29. 2012. agreement: To achieve four percent (4%) reduction, beginning with the 2012-13<br/>school year, the teacher work year shall be reduced by eight (8) instructional days, from 179 days to 171<br/>days, with a commensurate salary schedule decrease (excluding honorariums, stipends and longevity) of<br/>four percent (4%) for all unit members, effective July 1, 2012. Refer to Appendix A, page 41, for further<br/>clarification.</p>
<p>As per November 17. 2009. agreement: The step and column section of the salary schedule is reduced<br/>by 2%. Effective January 1, 2010, other payments including but not limited to honorariums, longevity<br/>and stipends shall return to 2008-2009 salary schedule level and remain unchanged. Unit members shall<br/>advance on the salaiy schedule during the period of this contract in accordance with their placement and<br/>seniority.</p>
<p>District agrees to use any Federal Impact Aid funding above $3,708,000, exclusive of Table 9 funds, to<br/>reduce the structural deficit in any year. In the event the impact aid funding falls below $3,708,000, the<br/>structural deficit reduction contribution line in the restoration chart (Appendix A, Page 50) will increase<br/>by the appropriate ADA amount to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding for Federal Impact Aid drops from $3,708,000 to $3,500,000. The difference of<br/>$208,000 would be divided by the funded ADA ($5,082.95 for 2010-11) resulting in a<br/>$40.92 increase to the necessary structural deficit reduction contribution.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding for Federal Impact Aid increases from $3,708,000 to $4,000,000. The<br/>difference of $292,000 would be applied towards reducing the structural deficit by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>If the District receives additional unrestricted federal money, the first priority will be to fund existing<br/>unfunded certificated Full Time Employees (FTE’s) and the District agrees to spend any such monies first<br/>on funding those positions. There are currently 19 such FTE’s. The District will provide TUTA with the<br/>number of unfunded FTE’s by June 30<sup>th</sup> of each year of the contract. The second priority is to reduce the<br/>structural deficit.</p>

<p>APPENDIX A<br/>Tentative Agreement and MOU’s</p>
<p>Travis Unified School District and Travis Unified Teachers' Association<br/>TENTATIVE AGREEMENT May 29, 2012 (4:30 p.m.)</p>
<p>With the exception of the following, the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), as<br/>amended, which will expire on June 30, 2012, shall remain in full force and effect through June 30,<br/>2015.</p>
<p>Article 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Year Length</p>
<p>Article 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary and Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>Amend CBA to reflect and implement the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve four percent (4%) reduction, beginning with the 2012-2013 school year, the<br/>teacher work year shall be reduced by eight (8) instructional days, from 179 days to 171<br/>days, with a commensurate salary schedule decrease (excluding honorariums, stipends and<br/>longevity) of four percent (4%) for all unit members, effective July 1, 2012.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: the cost of a 1% salary schedule decrease or increase (excluding honorariums,<br/>stipends and longevity) for the certificated bargaining unit is $164,032. Each furlough day<br/>represents a Vi percent salary decrease equivalent.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New salary schedules shall reflect the reduction of work days and commensurate salary<br/>schedule reductions as described above.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the proposed reductions would result in a work year reduction below the<br/>minimum number of instructional days required by State law, as of January 1, 2013, then<br/>the requisite number of instructional days shall be restored as required by law, but a<br/>commensurate salary schedule decrease shall be implemented to achieve the total four<br/>percent (4%) reduction.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to calendar the above-referenced eight (8) additional furlough days on:</p>
<p>October 8, 2012 (all sites)</p>
<p>April 29, 2013 (all sites)</p>
<p>May 24, 2013 (all sites)</p>
<p>June 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, 2013 (Traditional Sites)</p>
<p>June 13, 14, 17, 18 and 19, 2013 (Modified Sites)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of new unrestricted revenue that exceeds the structural deficit, the parties'<br/>shared priority is to restore instructional days along with the corresponding salary<br/>adjustment. Order of priority for possible restoration is as follows: April 29, 2013; May 24,<br/>2013; and the last week of instruction (June dates above, traditional/modified).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible after the November election but not later than November 30, 2012, this<br/>agreement shall be mutually reopened by the parties to consider the impact of the ballot<br/>measure on the fiscal condition</p>
<p>of the District and restoration options to the salary schedule/teacher work year, or<br/>additional reductions.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that information sharing is essential. The parties shall meet before<br/>November 30, 2012 (including but not limited to post key Board meetings addressing<br/>Budget developments) to share information concerning the State Budget and its impact.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the current system of base revenue limit funding is discontinued or modified, or the State<br/>makes changes on how school districts are funded, either party may reopen this agreement</p>
<p>for the purpose of determining the impact of such changes upon the District's fiscal<br/>condition. The &quot;weighted student formula&quot; in the Governor's proposed 2012-13 Budget<br/>would qualify as a modification or change in school funding as described in this paragraph.</p>

<p>o Administration and the site Leadership Team will work together to determine the<br/>specific dates reserved to both administration and teachers. This will be done at the<br/>first Leadership Team meeting of the school year.</p>
<p>Open House</p>
<p>Amend first paragraph of section 7.6 as follows:</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 1, 2012 - June 30, 2015</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reopeners for 2013-14 and 2014-15 limited to total compensation and two additional issues<br/>per side.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN<br/>TRAVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND<br/>TRAVIS UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>Kindergarten Program 2012.13 School Year: Foxboro Elementary</p>
<p>The Travis Unified School District (District) and the Travis Unified Teachers’ Association<br/>(Association) agree to the following for the 2012-13 Kindergarten program at Foxboro<br/>Elementary:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the four (4) Kindergarten teachers at Foxboro Elementary is assigned to their<br/>own classroom.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the Kindergarten teachers is assigned to teach students during the A.M. session<br/>(8:25-11:50 A.M.).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This schedule provides an opportunity for all Kindergarten teachers and SDC teachers<br/>serving Kindergarten students to plan together during teacher common planning days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten classes may include one to five students from the Special Day Class<br/>programs. When those students are served in the general education setting, they are<br/>accompanied by Instructional Assistant support, and the SDC teacher is also often<br/>present and assisting in the general education class.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike previous years, Kindergarten teachers do not have a traditional co-teacher or<br/>partner working in their classrooms.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the Kindergarten classes participate in recess play on the school’s play structure,<br/>black top, and playground, with all other primary students. The teachers of those<br/>classes have rotating playground supervision duty. Two of the Kindergarten classes<br/>have recess on the Kindergarten playground, and those teachers divide supervision of<br/>the students during that time. This allows each of them a short break during recess.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Kindergarten teachers have scheduled 35 minute duty-free lunch breaks, and the<br/>requisite time is allotted for planning purposes.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each afternoon, Kindergarten teachers support the first and second grade staff and<br/>students with intervention groups, and administering benchmark assessments during the<br/>course of the school year. In addition, kindergarten teachers may serve their own at-risk<br/>students in extended sessions immediately following regular dismissal at 11:50, based<br/>on needs and by invitation.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again for the 2012-13 school year, the Kindergarten teachers have requested all classes<br/>be scheduled for morning, each teacher be assigned to their own classrooms,<br/>Kindergarten teachers would run intervention groups in the afternoons, and they<br/>acknowledged and agreed to the condition of not having a traditional teaching partner.</p>
<p>10. Foxboro Kindergarten classes have traditionally offered an extended day to students<br/>beginning in the spring of each year, allowing students to be included in school lunch<br/>services and extending instruction to 1:35 on Wednesdays. Last year, the extended day<br/>program was offered five (5) days a week, beginning in the Spring. The Kindergarten<br/>teachers have requested this option be reserved for implementation again this year, with<br/>the number of days and beginning date to be determined later in the school year.</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding shall sunset at the end of the 2013-14 school year.</p>
