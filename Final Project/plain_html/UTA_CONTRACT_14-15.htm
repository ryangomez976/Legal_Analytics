A District representative may be present as an observer. The alternative<br/>option would provide for the Unit Member paying an equivalent service fee to a designated local<br/>charity as outlined in paragraph 3 of this Contract. The panel shall consider the petitioner's<br/>desires only in terms of compelling and significant cause as to why petitioner should not pay a<br/>flat service fee or dues directly to the Association. The panel shall deny or approve the<br/>petitioner's position by a minimum of a simple majority. A tie vote is the same as a denial; in the<br/>event of a denial, the Unit Member must either pay a service fee or dues.</p>
<p>With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to this Section, whether for<br/>membership dues or agency fee, the District agrees promptly to remit such monies to the</p>

<p>In the event that the District makes a demand for reimbursement as provided above, the<br/>Association shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether any such action or<br/>proceeding for which it is reimbursing the District for legal fees and costs shall or shall not be<br/>compromised resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>

<p>Appendix 03</p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding<br/>Between</p>
<p>Ukiah Unified School District and Ukiah Teachers Association (UTA)</p>
<p>The funding structure has changed for Career Technical Education (CTE) programs. The Mendocino<br/>County Office of Education (MCOE) will cease funding employees working in these positions at Ukiah<br/>High School, and the District will pick up responsibility for funding these positions.</p>
<p>The parties to this MOU recognize their mutual rights and responsibilities under Education Code 45208<br/>and Government Code 3543.2 in that the incumbents in these positions are uniquely situated in having<br/>worked at Ukiah High School, although having being paid by MCOE, and will now be paid instead by the<br/>District, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p>This unique circumstance is a pertinent, agreed-upon criterion for allowing the affected employees to be<br/>transferred from MCOE to UUSD with the precise number of years of service credit they are currently<br/>being given from MCOE, without regard to salary schedule placement of other unit members and/or<br/>potentially conflicting language in Section 8 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>This is effective retroactive to July 1,2013.</p>
