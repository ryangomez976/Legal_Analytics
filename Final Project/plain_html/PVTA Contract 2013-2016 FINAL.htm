<p>ARTICLE 5</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this grievance procedure is to secure at the lowest possible<br/>level, resolution of grievances arising under this Agreement. Both parties<br/>agree that these proceedings shall be kept as informal and confidential as may<br/>be appropriate at any level of this procedure.</p>
<p>1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any member<br/>of the unit to have a grievance adjusted without intervention by the Association<br/>as long as the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and such adjustment is<br/>not inconsistent with the terms of the master contract. If any unit member<br/>presents a grievance on her/his own behalf, the District shall not agree to a<br/>resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the<br/>grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to<br/>file a response. The District shall provide the grievant with the appropriate<br/>printed forms.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance is an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the<br/>express terms of this Agreement. Actions to challenge or change the terms of<br/>this Agreement shall not be considered a grievance.</p>
<p>2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant is a unit member, unit members, or the Association making a claim<br/>on behalf of one or more unit members, or the Association on its own behalf.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the<br/>timetable specified at each level should be considered as a maximum and<br/>every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limit specified<br/>may be, however, extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school year,<br/>and could result in irreparable harm to the grievant, the District, or the<br/>Association, an effort should be made to reduce, by mutual agreement, the<br/>time limits set forth herein so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the</p>
<p>page 9 of 107<br/>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>end of the school year or as soon thereafter as is practical.</p>
<p>3.2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>A grievant shall first identify the alleged violation on a “Notice of Intent to<br/>File a Grievance” form (see Appendix A), submit the form to the<br/>principal or immediate supervisor, and discuss the grievance within five<br/>(5) duty days after the alleged violation or discovery of the alleged<br/>violation or, if grievant desires, through her/his chosen representative<br/>with the objective of resolving the matter informally.</p>
<p>3.2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One</p>
<p>3.2.2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, within five (5) duty days after this informal discussion, the<br/>grievant has not received a written disposition or is not satisfied<br/>with the disposition of the grievance, she/he may file a formal<br/>grievance with the principal or immediate supervisor in writing on<br/>a “Statement of Grievance - Level One” form (see Appendix At<br/>approved by the District and Association with a copy<br/>simultaneously provided to the Association. If the grievant<br/>requests a conference with the principal or immediate<br/>supervisor, the grievant and the principal or supervisor shall<br/>meet to discuss the grievance within five (5) duty days after the<br/>written grievance is filed.</p>
<p>3.2.2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) duty days after receipt of the “Statement of<br/>Grievance” form by the principal or immediate supervisor, or if a<br/>conference was requested within five (5) duty days, the principal<br/>or immediate supervisor shall render her/his formal decision in<br/>writing with a copy simultaneously provided to the Association.</p>
<p>3.2.2.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance, or if no disposition has occurred within the Level One<br/>timelines set forth above, the grievance may be appealed to<br/>Level Two within five (5) duty days on the “Statement of<br/>Grievance Form-Level Two” form (see Appendix A) to the<br/>Superintendent with a copy simultaneously provided to the<br/>Association.</p>

Within ten (10) duty days after<br/>the meeting or the date by which the meeting should have<br/>occurred, whichever is later, the Superintendent shall render<br/>his/her formal decision in writing.</p>
<p>3.2.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant and/or the Association is not satisfied with the</p>
<p>disposition of the grievance or if no disposition has occurred<br/>within the Level Two timelines, the grievant may request the<br/>Association to submit the grievance to binding arbitration. The<br/>Association shall decide whether to submit the grievance to<br/>binding arbitration.</p>
<p>3.2.4. Level Three</p>
<p>3.2.4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, by written notice to the District through the<br/>office of the Superintendent, within (10) duty days after receipt of<br/>the Level Two decision may submit the grievance to binding<br/>arbitration. The parties to the arbitration are the District and the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>3.2.4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator who<br/>shall be bound by the rules and procedures of the American<br/>Arbitration Association (AAA) or the California State Mediation<br/>and Conciliation Service (CSMCS). If the parties are unable to<br/>agree upon an arbitrator, the parties shall request a list of<br/>arbitrators from AAA or CMSCS. An arbitrator shall be selected<br/>by the following procedures: The Association and the employer’s<br/>representative shall select the arbitrator from the American<br/>Arbitration Association or California State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Service list by eliminating names until one remains.<br/>The first option of elimination shall alternate. The one remaining<br/>name shall be the arbitrator. The process of striking names shall<br/>occur within five (5) days of receipt of the list from the American<br/>Arbitration Association or California State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Service by both parties. All grievances reaching the<br/>arbitration level shall be numbered. The odd-numbered<br/>grievances will give the District first elimination; even numbered<br/>grievances will give the Association first elimination.</p>
<p>3.2.4.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any question which arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance<br/>shall be ruled upon by the arbitrator first before hearing the<br/>merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>page 11 of 107<br/>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>3.2.4.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any<br/>decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by<br/>law or which is in violation of the terms of this Agreement. The<br/>decision of the arbitrator shall be submitted in writing to the<br/>Superintendent and the Association and shall be final and<br/>binding upon the parties of this Agreement.</p>
<p>3.2.4.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision shall be in writing and shall set forth<br/>her/his findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusion on the issues<br/>submitted.</p>
<p>3.2.4.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not<br/>limited to per diem expenses, her/his travel and subsistence<br/>expenses and the cost of any hearing room shall be borne<br/>equally by the parties. Upon the request of either party, a<br/>certified court reporter shall be employed to record verbatim the<br/>entire hearing. The parties shall share equally the cost of the<br/>reporter. If either party desires a transcript, that party shall pay<br/>the costs for that transcript. All other costs shall be borne by the<br/>party incurring them.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Certificated Unit members</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the District, the Association, or by any member<br/>or representative of the District or the Association, against any grievant, any party in<br/>interest, any bargaining unit member, the Association, or any other participant in the<br/>grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>5.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by<br/>herself/himself, or at her/his option, by a representative. If any unit member is<br/>not represented by the Association, the Association shall have the right to state<br/>its views at all stages of the grievance procedure after Level One.</p>
<p>5.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>Administration at a level at or above the principal or immediate supervisor, the<br/>grievant shall submit such grievance in writing to the Superintendent and the<br/>Association and the processing of such a grievance shall commence at Level<br/>Two.</p>
<p>page 12 of 107<br/>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>5.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the Association to<br/>attend any of the formal grievance proceedings during the duty day, she/he<br/>shall be released without loss of pay in order to permit participation in the<br/>foregoing activities. Any unit member who is required to appear in such<br/>proceedings as a witness will be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>5.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered and appeals filed at all levels of the grievance process shall<br/>be in writing, setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore and shall be<br/>transmitted to the grievant, the Superintendent, and Association president or<br/>their designees. Time limits for appeal provided in each level shall begin on the<br/>duty day following receipt of the written decision by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>5.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance shall be maintained in a separate grievance file and shall not be<br/>placed in the personnel file of any of the participants.</p>

<p>5.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the grievant to appeal a decision within the time specified in this<br/>Article shall represent an acceptance of the decision.</p>
<p>5.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may discipline a unit member only for just cause. The following<br/>progressive discipline procedures will be applied, except where the serious<br/>nature of the offense may require the District to directly impose a written<br/>warning, written reprimand, or suspension without pay:</p>
<p>5.9.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal Counseling/Warning: The district shall first issue a verbal<br/>counseling/warning before imposing further discipline. Verbal<br/>counseling/warning may result in a post-conference summary<br/>memorandum. Post-conference summary memorandum shall not be<br/>placed in the unit member's personnel file.</p>
<p>5.9.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Warning: Subject to section above, written warnings shall not be<br/>used unless the unit member has been verbally warned about similar<br/>actions within the last twelve (12) months. Written warnings shall not be<br/>placed in the unit member's file.</p>
<p>5.9.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Reprimand: Subject to section above, written reprimands shall<br/>not be used unless the unit member has received a written warning<br/>about similar actions within the last twelve (12) months. The unit</p>
<p>page 13 of 107</p>

<p>member shall sign the reprimand to acknowledge receipt and a copy<br/>shall be placed in the unit member's personnel file.</p>
<p>5.9.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension Without Pay: Subject to section above, suspension shall not<br/>be used unless the unit member has received a written reprimand about<br/>similar actions within the last twelve (12) months. No unit member shall<br/>be suspended more than fifteen (15) working days during a school year.<br/>In all instances, however, the length of a suspension shall relate to the<br/>severity of the action. Notice of suspension shall be made in writing and<br/>served in person or by certified mail upon the unit member by the<br/>superintendent or designee. A copy shall be concurrently provided to<br/>the Association president. The notice of suspension shall contain:</p>
<p>5.9.4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement of the specific acts or omissions upon which the<br/>action is based;</p>
<p>5.9.4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement of the cause(s) for which action is recommended;</p>

<p>5.9.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only written reprimands and suspension without pay may be appealed<br/>to arbitration under the grievance procedure in Article 5 (Grievance<br/>Procedure) of the Agreement commencing with Level Three (Arbitration<br/>Level). If timely appealed, the penalty shall not be applied until the<br/>arbitrator's decision is rendered, except for just cause necessitating the<br/>immediate removal of the unit member from the worksite. At arbitration,<br/>the just cause for earlier discipline, may be determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>5.9.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association must request arbitration by delivering written notice of<br/>appeal to the superintendent within twenty (20) duty days after receipt of<br/>the notice of suspension or written reprimand. If the Association does<br/>not demand arbitration within the above timeline, the suspension without<br/>pay or letter of reprimand may be imposed immediately by the<br/>superintendent or designee.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 10<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURE<br/>Overview</p>
<p>The District and PVTA are committed to a teacher evaluation system that is comprehensive,<br/>promotes exemplary teaching, and provides ample opportunities for self-reflection and<br/>professional growth. Unit member evaluations encompass all aspects of teacher roles and<br/>responsibilities described in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP),<br/>2009.</p>
<p>The California Standards for the Teaching Profession, 2009, (see appendix I.) will continue<br/>as the basis for the evaluation process in the Portola Valley School District. “The 2010<br/>Continuum of Teaching Practice (see appendix J.) is aligned with the CSTP, builds on<br/>California’s pre-service Teaching Performance Expectations and sets forth a description of<br/>teaching that respects the diverse ways teachers pursue excellence in teaching and learning.”<br/>(Continuum of Teaching Practice, p. 2) Unit members will be evaluated using the five<br/>indicators described in the Continuum document plus a zero point, “not evident” column, has<br/>been added creating a six (0-5) point rubric: Not Evident, Emerging, Exploring, Applying,<br/>Integrating, and Innovating. The District will use the rubrics from the Continuum of Teaching<br/>Practice as a tool for self-reflection, goal setting, and inquiry into practice to guide this<br/>evaluation process. “A formative assessment system has three essential components:<br/>standards, criteria and evidence of practice. Standards refer to the CSTP and are in alignment<br/>with the P-12 academic content standards. Criteria refer to indicators of teaching practice.<br/>Evidence of practice includes multiple sources of data, and student work analyses and is used<br/>to make valid self-assessments on the Continuum of Teaching Practice. The Continuum of<br/>Teaching Practice is one component of a comprehensive formative assessment system for<br/>teachers, based on the CSTP.” (Continuum, p. 2)</p>
<p>All Portola Valley School District teachers should strive to perform at the highest levels<br/>(Integrating and Innovating) of this continuum in all areas. Those unit members who are not<br/>performing at their highest levels should take the steps necessary to grow and improve their<br/>practice. The District and PVTA are committed to providing support to all probationary and<br/>permanent status unit members through the Consulting Teacher Program. The District<br/>recognizes that “a teacher may be at Level 1 or 2 in some elements of the CSTP and Levels 3<br/>and 4 in others, no matter how many years she or he has been in the profession. Because a<br/>teacher’s growth is developmental, one may return to an earlier level temporarily if there are<br/>changes in a teacher’s career, such as new course content, grade level, school, or student<br/>demographics. In fact, it is not uncommon for teachers to self-assess and find they have<br/>moved from right to left on the Continuum of Teaching Practice in response to new teaching</p>
<p>page 28 of 107</p>
<p>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>contexts, responsibilities, challenges, or even deeper understanding of the work.” (Continuum,<br/>p. 3)</p>
<p>TIMELINES AND PROCEDURES</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The evaluation of unit members shall be based upon the unit member demonstrating<br/>the following:</p>
<p>1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession, 2009, and<br/>Continuum of Teaching Practice.</p>
<p>1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of non-instructional duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student progress toward grade level/district academic standards, either as<br/>stipulated in the National Common Core State Standards or as determined by<br/>the unit member and the evaluator in consultation.</p>

<p>15.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each school year.<br/>Unit members shall be notified no later than June 30 of the status of the Bank<br/>and whether or not contributions will be required for the following year.<br/>Subsequent contributions shall be drawn automatically from the participating<br/>unit members’ accumulate leave totals.

<p>15.14.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a re-occurrence or a second illness or injury incapacitates a unit<br/>member or member of the unit member's family within 12 months, it<br/>shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5) consecutive days.</p>
<p>15.14.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members must use all sick leave available to them before eligible<br/>for a withdrawal from the Bank.</p>

The<br/>Committee shall choose only a physician who qualifies under the negotiated<br/>insurance policy. Refusal to submit to the medical review will terminate the unit<br/>member's continued withdrawal from the Bank but will not affect their continued<br/>status as a contributor or participant. The Committee may deny an extension of<br/>withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank based upon the medical report.</p>
<p>15.18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualifies the<br/>unit member for worker compensation benefits unless the unit member has<br/>exhausted all worker compensation leave, her/his own sick leave, and provided<br/>further that the unit member signs over any worker compensation checks for<br/>temporary benefits to the District. If there are any worker compensation checks<br/>signed over to the District, the Bank will not be charged days, or if charged, will<br/>be reimbursed the number of days for which the worker compensation payment<br/>is equivalent to a regular day of pay at the negotiated rate for that unit member.<br/>If the District challenges the worker compensation claim, the unit member may<br/>draw from the Bank, but upon settlement of the claim, the Bank shall be<br/>reimbursed the days by the District.</p>
<p>15.19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank, for any reason, does not have sufficient days to<br/>fund a withdrawal request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide<br/>days and the District is under no obligation to pay the participant any funds<br/>whatsoever. If the Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension<br/>of withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the request, they shall notify<br/>the unit member, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>page 45 of 107<br/>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>15.20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank unit member participants who are denied a<br/>withdrawal or whose withdrawal is not renewed or terminated may, within thirty<br/>(30) days of denial, appeal, in writing, to the Executive Board of the<br/>Association. The Executive Board of the Association shall hold a hearing within<br/>fifteen (15) days. The Executive Board shall issue a confidential written<br/>decision within fifteen (15) duty days of the hearing. If the unit member's<br/>incapacitation does not allow participation in this appeal process, the unit<br/>member's agent or member of the family may process the appeal.</p>
<p>15.21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the exhaustion of sick<br/>leave or the waiting periods provided for in Section 8, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>Probationary Unit Members (New Hires): Probationary unit members shall remain on<br/>the adjusted Master Salary Schedule (Appendix E) for the duration of their<br/>probationary period and shall advance accordingly each year. Newly hired<br/>probationary unit members shall be initially placed on the schedule according to the<br/>step-and-column credits awarded by the District upon initial hire.</p>
<p>The existing salary schedule shall be replaced by a differentiated compensation<br/>structure based on one or more of the following measures of unit member growth and<br/>service:</p>
<p>1.1. Professional Development (Professional Development/Universitv Unit Approval<br/>Form) Guaranteed opportunity for every unit member = 1.20% per year.<br/>Members may “bank&quot; up to an additional 3 semester units or 45 hours or<br/>combination of units/hours up to a 1.2% to be applied to the following year's<br/>salary.</p>
<p>1.1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accredited university unit/credits: .4% increase per semester unit - must<br/>be completed and verified by September 15, in order to be<br/>compensated in the current year, otherwise the salary increase posts to<br/>the following work year.</p>
<p>1.1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approved professional development hours: .4% increase per 15 hours -<br/>must be completed and verified by September 15, in order to be<br/>compensated in the current year, otherwise the salary increase posts to<br/>the following work year. (Unit members attending District-sponsored or<br/>District-mandated professional development sessions, workshops, or<br/>training shall have the option of being compensated per diem or<br/>deferring the hours toward the requisite 15-hour total for the<br/>above-described .4% salary increase.)</p>
<p>1.1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation Acceleration for Unit Members in Approved Advanced<br/>Degree Programs: A unit member in an approved advanced degree<br/>program may earn a maximum of 4.4% annual salary improvement<br/>during the course of the degree period.

<p>page 47 of 107</p>
<p>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>compensation improvement for a typical degree program which is<br/>expected to be two [2] years.) A unit member in an approved program<br/>may earn 2.4% salary increase in each of three consecutive years. In<br/>each of these years, the unit member may “bank” units equivalent to a<br/>1.2% increase (3 units).</p>
<p>These salary awards will be made following the same approval process<br/>as all other professional development increments. A unit member must<br/>be enrolled in a degree program relevant to this position with the<br/>District. The program shall be approved by the superintendent, or<br/>designee. The individual courses will be approved by the joint PVTA -<br/>administration committee.</p>

(Unit members<br/>shall have the option of being evaluated every other year, with the off year<br/>being ineligible for the 1% evaluation-based salary increase. Unit members,<br/>during that off year, shall remain responsible for demonstrating successful<br/>implementation of instructional approaches, practices, programs, and/or<br/>curricular components related to professional development, as outlined in 1.1<br/>above, in order to qualify for the associated .4% increase.

<p>1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district contribution towards the cost of health plan premiums shall be<br/>$8,628.00 for each full-time equivalent (1.0 FTE) unit member. For unit<br/>members who are .50 FTE to .99 FTE, the district contribution shall be<br/>pro-rated based on their FTE.</p>
<p>1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each unit member regardless of their FTE (full-time equivalent) who<br/>participate in the Kaiser HMO with the Health Savings Account component, the<br/>District will contribute $2000.00 annually for those who are individually enrolled,<br/>and $4000.00 annually for those unit members whose enrollment includes a<br/>spouse, registered domestic partner and/or eligible dependent children. This<br/>provision will remain in effect until such time that the Kaiser HMO with the<br/>Health Savings Account component is no longer included in the health plans<br/>offered to unit members or until the terms of this provision are altered by mutual<br/>agreement between PVTA and the District. Should either the plan deductible or<br/>plan premium increase during the term of the contract, the district will increase<br/>its contribution either to each unit member's Health Savings Account or plan<br/>premium accordingly so that there is no out-of-pocket cost associated with the<br/>deductible or the plan as a whole.</p>
<p>1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unit members who participate in the Kaiser HMO (“Plan”) with the Health<br/>Savings Account component, there shall be no out-of-pocket expense<br/>whatsoever for costs associated with the plan provided that the member<br/>complies with the terms and conditions of the plan.</p>
<p>1.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unit members who participate in the Kaiser HMO/Traditional plan with “Unit<br/>member plus family” coverage, there shall be no increase in the payroll<br/>deduction towards the premium cost from what was deducted for the same<br/>coverage during the 2006-07 school year.</p>
<p>1.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrollment in the Blue Shield HMO will be limited to individuals who were<br/>enrolled in the plan as of June 30, 2007. Enrollment of newly-hired unit<br/>members or current unit members during the open enrollment period shall not<br/>be allowed.</p>

<p>1.2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time teachers are deemed by the law to meet the 1,250 hour<br/>test. (29 CFR §825.110(c). See also §7297.3(e)(2))</p>
<p>1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Care And Medical Leave Entitlement</p>
<p>Subject to the provisions of this policy and State and federal law, an<br/>eligible employee is entitled to the total of 12 workweeks of leave during<br/>any 12-month period for any one, or more, of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of a child and to care for the newborn child;</p>
<p>1.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster<br/>care by the employee. (29 CFR §825.200(a), §825.112(a):<br/>Government Code §12945.2(c)(3))</p>

<p>page 74 of 107<br/>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>1.3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of an employee’s own serious health condition that makes<br/>the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee’s<br/>position, except for disability on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or<br/>related medical conditions, which is covered by pregnancy disability<br/>leave. (Government Code §12945.2(c)(3)(c); See 29 CFR<br/>§825.114-115 for definitions of “serious health condition” and<br/>“unable to perform the functions of the employee’s position.)</p>
<p>1.3.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For family care and medical leave purposes, the “12-month period”<br/>in which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement occurs is the school<br/>calendar year. (29 CFR §825.200(b))</p>
<p>1.4. Minimum Duration Of Leave</p>
<p>1.4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Intermittent leave” is leave taken in separate blocks of time due to<br/>a single qualifying reason, rather than for one continuous period of<br/>time. (29 CFR §825.203(a), 29 CFR §825.203(a))</p>
<p>1.4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “reduced leave schedule” is a leave schedule that reduces an<br/>employee’s usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours<br/>per workday. (29 CFR §825.203(a))</p>
<p>1.4.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum duration for leave taken for serious health condition of a<br/>parent, child, or spouse or for the serious health condition of the<br/>employee:</p>
<p>1.4.3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of this policy, an employee may<br/>take family care and medical leave intermittently or on a<br/>reduced leave schedule to care for a sick spouse, parent or<br/>child when medically necessary or for the employee’s own<br/>serious health condition when medically necessary. (2 CCR<br/>§7297.3)</p>
<p>1.4.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following conditions must be met for an employee to<br/>take family leave on an intermittent or a reduced leave<br/>schedule under this section:</p>
<p>1.4.3.2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there must be a medical need for leave (as<br/>distinguished from voluntary treatments and<br/>procedures);</p>
<p>1.4.3.2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the medical need can be best accommodated through<br/>an intermittent or reduced leave schedule;</p>
<p>1.4.3.2.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the employee must provide certification of the<br/>medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a<br/>reduced schedule. The certification of a serious health<br/>condition required below meets this requirement. (29</p>
<p>page 75 of 107<br/>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>CFR §825.117)</p>
<p>1.4.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum duration for leave taken for the birth, adoption, or foster<br/>care placement of a child:</p>
<p>1.4.4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family care and medical leave taken because of the birth,<br/>adoption, or foster care placement of a child of the employee<br/>does not have to be taken in one continuous period of time.</p>
<p>1.4.4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any leave(s) taken shall be concluded within one year of the<br/>birth or placement of the child with the employee in<br/>connection with the adoption of foster care of the child by the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>1.4.4.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic minimum duration of the leave shall be two weeks.<br/>However, the District shall grant a request for a leave of less<br/>than two weeks’ duration on any two occasions. (2 CCR<br/>§7297.3(d))</p>
<p>1.4.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave increments shall be taken in increments of at least half a<br/>day. Only the amount of leave actually taken will be counted toward<br/>the 12 weeks of leave to which an employee is entitled. (29 CFR<br/>§825.203(d), 29 CFR §825.205)</p>
<p>1.4.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees needing intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave<br/>schedule must attempt to schedule their leave so as not to disrupt<br/>the District’s operations. (29 CFR §825.117)</p>
<p>1.4.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may, at its discretion, assign an employee to an<br/>alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that better<br/>accommodates the employee’s intermittent or reduced leave<br/>schedule, as determined by the District. (29 CFR §825.117, 29<br/>CFR §825.204)</p>
<p>1.5. Pav Status And Benefits</p>
<p>1.5.1. Except as provided in this section, the family care and medical<br/>leave will be without pay or benefits. However, the District will<br/>continue to provide and pay for group health benefits during the<br/>period of leave on the same basis as coverage would have been<br/>provided had the employee been continuously employed during the<br/>entire leave period. (29 CFR §825.207, 29 CFR §825.209;<br/>Government Code §12945.2(d),(e),(f); 29 CFR §7297.5(c))</p>
<p>1.5.1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee will be required to continue to pay his/her</p>
<p>share of premiums payments, if any. Payment is due at the<br/>same time as it would be made if by payroll deduction. (29<br/>CFR §825.210, 29 CFR §825.210(a) &amp; (e))</p>
<p>page 76 of 107</p>
<p>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>1.5.1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the District may choose to maintain an employee’s<br/>health benefits, if the employee fails to pay the employee’s<br/>share of the premiums, the District’s obligation to maintain<br/>health insurance coverage ceases if an employee’s premium<br/>payment is more than 30 days late. (29 CFR §825.212(a) &amp;<br/>(c); Government Code §12935(a), 12945.2), 2 CCR<br/>§7297.5(f).</p>
<p>1.5.1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As permitted by law, the District will recover from the<br/>employee the employee’s share of any premium payments<br/>missed by the employee for any unpaid family care and<br/>medical leave period during which the District maintains<br/>health coverage by paying the employee’s share after the<br/>premium payment is missed. (29 CFR §825.212(b) and 29<br/>CFR §825.213)</p>
<p>1.5.1.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As permitted by law, the District will recover from an<br/>employee its share of health plan premiums during a period<br/>of unpaid family care and medical leave if the employee fails<br/>to return to work after the employee’s family care and<br/>medical leave entitlement has expired. (Government Code<br/>§12945.2(f), 2 CCR §7297.5; §825.212 and 29 CFR<br/>§825.213)</p>
<p>1.5.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Benefits</p>
<p>An employee’s entitlement, if any, to benefits other than group<br/>health benefits while on family care and medical leave is<br/>determined by the District’s established policies regarding other<br/>forms of paid or unpaid leave, as appropriate. (2 CCR §7297.5(d);<br/>Government Code §12945.2(f)(2))</p>
<p>1.5.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relationship Of Family Care And Medical Leave To Other Leaves</p>
<p>1.5.3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Of Other Paid Leave</p>
<p>An employee may elect or the District may require the<br/>substitution of an employee’s accrued vacation or other<br/>accrued paid leave, other than sick leave, for any part of the<br/>employee’s family care and medical leave. An employee<br/>may elect or the District may require the substitution of<br/>accrued sick leave only under circumstances permitted by<br/>the District policy and/or the collective bargaining agreement<br/>for the substituted leave.</p>
<p>1.5.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any leave of absence which qualifies as family care and<br/>medical leave and is designated by the District as family</p>
<p>page 77 of 107</p>
<p>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>care and medical leave will be counted as running<br/>consecutively with any other paid or unpaid leave to which<br/>the employee may be entitled for the same qualifying reason<br/>under a collective bargaining agreement, board policy or<br/>state law. (Government Code §12945.2(e); 29 CFR<br/>§825.207, §825.208; 29 CCR §7297.5)</p>
<p>1.5.3.3. Workers’ Compensation Leave</p>
<p>The District may count any time off for an employee’s<br/>on-the-job injury against the employee’s family care and<br/>medical leave entitlement when the employee’s injury meets<br/>the criteria for a serious health condition; however, and<br/>employee’s accrued paid leave may not be substituted for<br/>any part of a FMLA leave that is also a workers’<br/>compensation leave. (29 CFR 825.207(d)(2), also,<br/>825.210(f). 825.216(d), 825.220(d), 825.307(a)(1))</p>
<p>1.6. Notice To District</p>
<p>1.6.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must provide written notice to the District as far in<br/>advance of the leave as possible and as soon as the employee<br/>reasonably knows of the need for the leave. If the need for the<br/>leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement for<br/>adoption or foster care or planned medical treatment, the notice<br/>must be provided at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of<br/>the leave, or if not reasonably known thirty (30) calendar days<br/>before the leave, then as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>The written notice must inform the District of the reasons for the<br/>leave, the anticipated duration of the leave and the anticipated start<br/>of the leave. The District’s Request for Family and Medical Leave<br/>Form should be used whenever possible. (29 CFR §825.302; 2<br/>CCR §7297.4)</p>
<p>1.6.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee fails to give 30 days notice for foreseeable leave<br/>with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the District may deny the<br/>family care and medical leave request until at least 30 days after<br/>the date the employee provides notice to the District of the need for<br/>family care and medical leave. (29 CFR §825.304(b))</p>
<p>1.6.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees shall consult with the District and make a<br/>reasonable effort to schedule any planned medical treatment or<br/>supervision so as to minimize disruption to District’s operations. (2</p>

<p>CCR §7297.4(a)(2))</p>
<p>1.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Certification</p>
<p>1.7.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee’s request for family care and medical leave to care for<br/>a child, a spouse, or a parent who has a serious health condition<br/>shall be supported by a certification issued by the health care<br/>provider of the individual requiring care. I additional leave is<br/>required after the expiration of the time originally estimated by the<br/>health care provider, the employee shall provide the District with<br/>recertification by the health care provider. (Government Code<br/>§12945.2(j); 29 CFR §825.3005-306; 2 CCR §7297.11, §7297.0(a))</p>
<p>1.7.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee’s request for family care and medical leave because<br/>of the employee’s own serious health condition shall be supported<br/>by a certification issued by the employee’s health care provider.<br/>(Government Code §12945,2(k)</p>
<p>1.7.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a condition of an employee’s return from leave taken because of<br/>the employee’s own serious health condition, the employee is<br/>required to obtain certification from the employee’s care provider<br/>that the employee is able to resume work. (29 CFR §825.310)</p>
<p>1.7.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are required to use the “Certification of Health Care<br/>Provider or Practitioner” form available from the District to meet the<br/>certification and recertification requirements of this policy.</p>
<p>1.7.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As permitted by law, at the District’s discretion and expense, the<br/>District may require that the employee obtain the opinion of a<br/>second health care provider designated or approved by the District<br/>in accordance with the appropriate statutory provisions. At the<br/>District’s discretion and expense, the District may also require the<br/>opinion of a third health care provider, in accordance with the<br/>appropriate statutory provisions, in the event that the second<br/>opinion differs from the opinion in the original certification. At the<br/>employee’s request, the District shall provide the employee with<br/>copies of any second and third medical options. (Government Code<br/>§12945.2(k); 29 CFR §825.307-308; 2 CCR §7297.4(b)(2))</p>
<p>1.7.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this policy, “health care provider” means a health care<br/>provider as defined in federal and state regulation implementing the<br/>FMLA and the CFRA. (29 CFR §825.11; 2 CCR §7297.(j))</p>

<p>page 79 of 107<br/>Go to Table of Contents or Appendices</p>
<p>designation.</p>
<p>1.9. Employee’s Status On Returning From Leave</p>
<p>Except as provided by law, on return from family care and medical leave,<br/>an employee is entitled to be returned to the same position the employee<br/>held when leave commenced if the same position still exists, or if leave<br/>extends into a second school year. Otherwise the employee is entitled to<br/>be returned to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and<br/>other terms and conditions of employment. The leave shall not constitute a<br/>break in service for purposes of longevity or seniority under a collective<br/>bargaining agreement or any employee benefit plan. (Government Code<br/>§12945.2(g); 29 CFR §825.214-219; 2 CCR §7297.5(f))</p>
<p>1.10. Relationship To Pregnancy Disability Leave</p>

<p>Revised CSTP</p>
<p>The California Standards for the Teaching Profession, 2009, (see appendix L.) will continue<br/>as the basis for the evaluation process in the Portola Valley School District. “The 2010<br/>Continuum of Teaching Practice (see appendix M.) is aligned with the CSTP, builds on<br/>California’s pre-service Teaching Performance Expectations and sets forth a description of<br/>teaching that respects the diverse ways teachers pursue excellence in teaching and learning.”<br/>(Continuum of Teaching Practice, p. 2) Unit members will be evaluated using the five<br/>indicators described in the Continuum document plus a zero point, “not evident” column, has<br/>been added creating a six (0-5) point rubric: Not Evident, Emerging, Exploring, Applying,<br/>Integrating, and Innovating. The District will use the rubrics from the Continuum of Teaching<br/>Practice as a tool for self-reflection, goal setting, and inquiry into practice to guide this<br/>evaluation process. “A formative assessment system has three essential components:<br/>standards, criteria and evidence of practice. Standards refer to the CSTP and are in alignment<br/>with the P-12 academic content standards. Criteria refer to indicators of teaching practice.<br/>Evidence of practice includes multiple sources of data, and student work analyses and is used<br/>to make valid self-assessments on the Continuum of Teaching Practice. The Continuum of<br/>Teaching Practice is one component of a comprehensive formative assessment system for<br/>teachers, based on the CSTP.” (Continuum, p. 2)</p>
<p>All Portola Valley School District teachers should strive to perform at the highest levels<br/>(Integrating and Innovating) of this continuum in all areas. Those unit members who are not<br/>performing at their highest levels should take the steps necessary to grow and improve their<br/>practice. The District and PVTA are committed to providing support to all probationary and<br/>permanent status unit members through the Consulting Teacher Program. The District<br/>recognizes that “a teacher may be at Level 1 or 2 in some elements of the CSTP and Levels 3<br/>and 4 in others, no matter how many years she or he has been in the profession. Because a<br/>teacher’s growth is developmental, one may return to an earlier level temporarily if there are<br/>changes in a teacher’s career, such as new course content, grade level, school, or student<br/>demographics. In fact, It is not uncommon for teachers to self-assess and find they have<br/>moved from right to left on the Continuum of Teaching Practice in response to new teaching<br/>contexts, responsibilities, challenges, or even deeper understanding of the work.” (Continuum,<br/>p. 3)</p>

<p>and student growth.</p>
<p>Step 2: The evaluator (principal, dean of students, program specialist, assistant<br/>superintendent, or superintendent) will meet with permanent status unit members by October<br/>15 of the evaluation year. During this meeting, the evaluator will review the CSTP standards<br/>and Continuum of Teaching Practice rubrics with the unit member and establish an evaluation<br/>blog. The unit member shall complete a self-assessment, indicating their placement on the<br/>rubric in each of the CSTPs. The evaluator shall provide input into this process, and the<br/>evaluator and unit member shall collaboratively agree to the unit member’s placement on the<br/>various rubrics. Progress metrics shall be determined by the unit member and evaluator in<br/>consultation.</p>
<p>Step 3: The unit member shall select one area within each standard they would like to work<br/>on for the year. The evaluator will meet with the teacher and identify three or four top<br/>priorities from these for focus areas. The evaluator and the unit member shall meet in<br/>January or February to discuss the unit member's progress in the three or four focus areas.<br/>Unit member shall provide ongoing evidence/material documentation of progress toward the<br/>successful achievement of previously agreed upon professional goals via posts to their<br/>evaluation blog.</p>
<p>Step 4: The evaluator will make several brief (approximately 10-15 minutes), unannounced<br/>visits during the school year. Each time the evaluator visits the classroom, s/he will provide<br/>the unit member with informal, brief written feedback via the blog. Evaluator shall inform the<br/>unit member, at this time, of any deficiencies that might place the unit member in jeopardy of<br/>failing to achieve the agreed upon professional goals.</p>
<p>Step 5: The evaluator and unit member shall meet some time between mid-April and the end<br/>of May to revisit the self assessment focus areas and determine current placement. The<br/>evaluator’s notes, unit member’s reflections, student work samples, and assessments will all<br/>be considered when making this placement.</p>
