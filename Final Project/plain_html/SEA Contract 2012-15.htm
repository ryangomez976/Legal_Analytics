<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When requesting family care and medical leave because of a<br/>serious health condition, the request shall be supported by a<br/>certification from the health care provider of the person<br/>requiring care.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Certification shall include the following:</p>

<p>11.1 General Provisions</p>

<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-Directed Professional Growth Plan for Permanent Teachers</p>
<p>11.2.1 Introduction</p>
<p>The self-directed evaluation process of the Shoreline Unified School District is<br/>based on these commonly held assumptions:</p>
<p>TRUST &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change in teacher performance occurs when</p>
<p>teachers are empowered to direct their own<br/>evaluation</p>
<p>AUTONOMY</p>
<p>LEARNING</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>CYCLE</p>
<p>11.2.2 Definition</p>
<p>Each teacher is capable of increasingly self-directed<br/>behavior in relation to his/her own teaching.</p>
<p>A self-directed evaluation system should enhance<br/>and facilitate teacher learning which in turn supports<br/>student growth and development.</p>
<p>A self-directed evaluation system should<br/>enable teachers in different stages of their<br/>professional development, to identify their current<br/>learning needs.</p>
<p>The parties define a self-directed evaluation system as one that facilitates trust<br/>between staff and administration, supports teacher autonomy and learning which in<br/>turn will serve as a model for student autonomy and learning, and acknowledges<br/>the varying states of a teacher's professional development as they progress through<br/>their careers.</p>
<p>11.2.3 How it Works</p>
<p>The self-directed evaluation process begins in the fall. A teacher designs his/her<br/>goals and writes apian to accomplish them prior to October 15. The teacher meets<br/>with the principal by October 15 to discuss implementation of the plan and to<br/>decide on check point dates. As the year proceeds, the plan may change or be<br/>updated with informal conferences. (See Attachment A).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>11.2.4 Self-Directed Criteria and Format</p>
<p>11.2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility<br/>Permanent Teacher<br/>Optional process-teacher choice</p>
<p>11.2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation Regarding Evaluation based on this Format<br/>Final approval rests with the administrator.</p>
<p>11.2.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on Self Directed Areas of Choice</p>
<p>Impact on student learning</p>
<p>Why am I interested?</p>
<p>What do I expect to accomplish?</p>
<p>What data, information or evidence will I collect<br/>to show progress?</p>
<p>What activities and actions will 1 use?</p>
<p>11.2.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of Choice and Description</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Observation/Coaching (See Attachment B)</p>
<p>Trained teachers working voluntarily with other teachers<br/>whom they trust in exchanging observations. Observations<br/>are preceded by a session or sessions where feedback is<br/>modeled and practiced. Working compatibility, technical<br/>feedback, analysis of application, adaptation to students and<br/>facilitation are aspects of Peer Observation. The minimum<br/>number of required observations is three (3).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-Directed Study/Research (See Attachment C)</p>
<p>Self-directed study/research involves critical thinking and<br/>problem solving directed toward classroom practices.<br/>Researchers will be able to link what he/she does with what<br/>a student learns with methods of assessment and data<br/>collection. Intensive research or training in an area that<br/>would have direct impact on that teacher's classroom<br/>environment. Some examples of work with a research<br/>project may include hut are not limited to: literacy,<br/>portfolio development, and curricular areas.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>3. Growth Portfolios (See Attachment D)</p>
<p>A collection of artifacts and documents that illustrate<br/>professional growth. Portfolios should provide current<br/>artifacts and evidences that serve the purpose of the<br/>portfolio; goals, curriculum, planning, learning experiences<br/>for students, evaluation of students' progress, and<br/>contributions to district and school.</p>

<p>SHORELINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>PEER OBSERVATION</p>
<p>A two-year study on teacher’s ability to acquire teaching skills and strategies has yielded two<br/>important Endings:</p>
<p>Teachers are excellent learners. Nearly all teachers can acquire new skills and can learn a<br/>considerable repertoire of teaching strategies new to them.</p>
<p>In order to improve their skills and to learn these new strategies, certain conditions must be<br/>present in the design of the inservice sessions. (Joyce and Showers, 1980, 1981).</p>
<p>The five conditions which were identified as essential to the development of the teachers’ skill in<br/>using new approaches or strategies are:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presentation of theory or description of skill or strategy</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modeling or demonstration of skills or models of teaching;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice in simulated and classroom settings;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structured and open-ended feedback (provision of information about<br/>performance);</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaching for application (hands-on, in classroom assistance with the transfer of<br/>skills and strategies to the classroom.)</p>
<p>When the first four of these conditions are used in combination in inservice sessions, the impact<br/>is considerable for most teachers up through the skill level. Unfortunately, the development of<br/>skill by itself does not insure transfer. However, when the component of coaching is added and<br/>implemented effectively, nearly all teachers will begin to transfer the new strategies into their<br/>active repertoire, (Joyce and Showers, 1982)</p>
<p>Coaching can be provided by workshop trainers, supervisors, principals or by peers (other<br/>teachers.) Probably the most practical and powerful coaching is provided by peers. Coaching, or<br/>Peer Observation as it is called here, has several functions or objectives.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision of Working Compatibility - The first function of Peer Observation is to</p>
<p>provide interchange with another human being over a difficult process. It is more<br/>pleasurable to share a new practice than to do it in isolation. The lonely business of<br/>teaching has often lacked the working compatibility which can be enjoyed in Peer<br/>Observation.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision of Technical Feedback - Teachers provide feedback to one another as they<br/>practice new teaching strategies. This is helpful not only to the teacher being observed,<br/>but to the observer as well.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of Application - In the early stages, adaption of new models or strategies to the<br/>students is often a difficult process. One of the major functions of a “coach” is to assist<br/>in determining how all the strategies are working with the students and if some changes<br/>need to be made.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaption to Students - In the early stages, adaption of new models or strategies to<br/>students is often a difficult process. One of the major functions of a “coach” is to assist<br/>in determining how all the strategies are working with the students and if some changes<br/>need to be made.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilitation - The successful use of a new teaching methods require practice. Peer<br/>Observation is useful in helping its’ members feel good about themselves during the early<br/>trials. It provides needed support in the learning process.</p>
