<p>33.10 Referred Permanent Teacher Peer Assistance Program</p>
<p>33.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Program is to provide assistance and renew quality teaching<br/>and offer remediation to permanent teachers whose performance has been<br/>evaluated as “unsatisfactory&quot; in either or both teaching methods and instruction<br/>by the principal or designated evaluator. In addition, it shall be the obligation of<br/>the Panel to report the results of this intervention to the Board of Education of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>33.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This PAR Program shall be limited to addressing those areas of performance set<br/>forth in the evaluation document listed as &quot;unsatisfactory” encompassed in the<br/>areas of subject matter knowledge, teaching strategies, or both.</p>
<p>33.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;focus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;areas</p>
<p>recommended for improvement by the participating teacher's evaluator based<br/>upon the unsatisfactory rating or ratings in the performance evaluation that<br/>resulted in the referral to the PAR Program.</p>
<p>33.10.4</p>
<p>33.10.5</p>
<p>33.10.6</p>
<p>33.10.7</p>
<p>33.10.8</p>
<p>33.10.9</p>
<p>33.10.10</p>
<p>Assistance and remedial efforts and activities shall be intense and multifaceted,<br/>and shall be preceded by a conference within 20 days of receipt of the written<br/>“unsatisfactory” evaluation. The conference shall involve the teacher being<br/>referred, the evaluator who evaluated the teacher, and coach, to begin the<br/>development of an Individual Assistance Plan. If the permanent teacher so<br/>desires, the Association shall provide representation in this meeting.</p>
<p>The assistance shall be provided by peer coaches under this Article and shall be<br/>closely monitored by the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>The course of assistance shall include one or more of the following:</p>
<p>33.10.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple classroom observations by the peer coach;</p>
<p>33.10.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance specific to the area of teaching methodology or<br/>instruction which has been evaluated to be “unsatisfactory.”</p>
<p>33.10.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for the teacher receiving assistance to observe<br/>exemplary practice, either by the peer coach or other exemplary<br/>teachers;</p>
<p>33.10.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development opportunities provided by the District;</p>
<p>33.10.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference attendance, often in the company of the peer coach,<br/>to facilitate reflection on how this experience fits into the<br/>Individual Assistance Plan;</p>
<p>33.10.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of assistance which the peer coach and the Panel<br/>may provide; and</p>
<p>33.10.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties understand that every possible subject matter<br/>competency may not be available within the corps of coaches,<br/>and therefore, it shall occasionally be necessary to secure<br/>additional assistance to fully address identified deficiencies. In<br/>such cases, the peer coach shall maintain prime responsibility<br/>for the Individual Assistance Plan, but may function more like a<br/>case carrier who assures the availability of appropriate<br/>resources.</p>
<p>Communication and consultation with the principal/evaluator shall be ongoing.</p>
<p>Nothing in this article precludes the principal/evaluator or District from doing<br/>informal observations and evaluations or from notifying the teacher verbally<br/>and/or in writing regarding incidents or events related to the teacher’s fulfillment<br/>of his or her professional obligations.</p>
<p>Written peer review reports will be submitted to the PAR Panel by the Peer<br/>Coach every 9 weeks or as needed. The coach will share all written and verbal<br/>evaluation reports during a conference with the teacher, prior to submission to<br/>the PAR Panel. A copy of the written reports will be provided to the<br/>principal/evaluator.</p>
<p>The peer coach shall submit an oral and written final report regarding the<br/>teacher’s participation in the PAR Program to the PAR Panel no later than end of<br/>the school year. This report shall describe the measures of assistance provided<br/>to the teacher and describe the results of the assistance in the area or areas<br/>recommended for improvement. The final report shall become a part of the</p>
<p>teacher’s permanent personnel file. The teacher shall have the opportunity to<br/>attach his or her comments.</p>
<p>33.10.10.1 The teacher and principal/evaluator may be present for the</p>
<p>coach’s presentation and will be given an opportunity to respond<br/>to the report.</p>
<p>33.10.11</p>
<p>33.10.12</p>
<p>33.10.13</p>
<p>33.10.14</p>
<p>33.10.15</p>
<p>33.10.16</p>
<p>33.10.17</p>
<p>The Panel shall deliberate whether:</p>
<p>33.10.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is now “proficient” in the areas evaluated, or</p>
<p>33.10.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher has made satisfactory progress but is not yet<br/>“proficient,” or</p>
<p>33.10.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher has not made satisfactory progress and further<br/>assistance and remediation will probably not result in<br/>“proficiency.”</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, and while the term of this assistance shall normally<br/>be for one school year, the assistance may be extended to a second year if the<br/>Panel believes progress is being made, although the permanent teacher may not<br/>have returned to a “proficient” level of performance.</p>
<p>The deliberations of the PAR Panel shall be closed and confidential. Panel<br/>decisions shall be based on the information provided by the coach, the<br/>principal/evaluator, and the permanent teacher and his or her bargaining unit<br/>representative.</p>
<p>The teacher, coach, or principal/evaluator may not be present during<br/>deliberations of the PAR Panel, which are confidential.</p>
<p>The decision of the PAR Panel shall be reported to the teacher, the coach, and<br/>principal/evaluator in conference with the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>The bargaining unit representative may be present if requested by the teacher.</p>
<p>The PAR Panel shall report their findings to the Board of Education.</p>
<p>33.11 Permanent Teacher Due Process Rights</p>
<p>33.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permanent teacher shall be entitled to review all reports generated by the</p>
<p>peer coach prior to their submission to the Panel and to have affixed thereto his<br/>or her comments. To effectuate this right, the peer coach shall provide the<br/>permanent teacher being reviewed with copies of such reports at least five (5)<br/>working days prior to any such meeting.</p>
<p>33.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permanent teacher shall have a right to be accompanied by the Association</p>

<p>33.11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This PAR Program in no manner diminishes the legal rights of bargaining unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>33.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Teacher Peer Assistance Program</p>
<p>33.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may volunteer for the peer assistance program. The PAR Panel will<br/>determine whether the teacher may participate in the program.

<p>33.12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteer teacher may terminate his or her participation in the Program at<br/>any time.</p>
<p>33.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning Teacher Peer Assistance Program</p>

<p>approval of the PAR Panel. All participants referred to the PAR Program based<br/>on an unsatisfactory evaluation will be served prior to accepting any beginning<br/>teacher participants.</p>
<p>33.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach and teacher will meet to determine the beginning teacher’s needs and<br/>jointly develop an Individual Assistance Plan. This plan will draw from the course<br/>of assistance that is available through the PAR Program and shall include<br/>timelines.</p>
<p>33.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches will provide oral and written feedback documentation to the beginning<br/>teacher. Communication between a beginning teacher and his or her coach<br/>concerning participation in the Program shall remain confidential within the<br/>Panel.</p>
<p>33.13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placed in the beginning teacher’s personnel file.</p>
<p>33.14 Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>33.14.1</p>
<p>Expenditures for the Program shall not exceed revenues received from the State<br/>for the PAR Program.</p>
<p>33.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set aside to allow for release days and/or conferences as</p>

For non-classroom until members (e.g.<br/>resource, special education, nurses, migrant, music, art, P.E., etc.) the District<br/>may implement cross track schedules that allow all tracks equal access to the<br/>specialists without increasing the number of duty days beyond that of other YRE<br/>unit members (179 days). The modified work year schedule shall provide for at<br/>least two (2) vacations of four (4) weeks duration, unless that unit member elects<br/>to work a four day workweek. A unit member who elects to work a four (4) day<br/>work week shall have at least one vacation of four (4) weeks duration. The<br/>affected unit member and the appropriate site administrator will mutually agree<br/>upon a schedule.</p>
<p>35.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended duty days for specialists.

<p>35.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are off-track will be permitted to substitute for on-track<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>35.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitutes will be called in order, from a list constructed by the District, giving<br/>priority and the right of first refusal to off-track teachers expressing their desire to<br/>be included on the list. Within the list, qualified teachers shall be granted<br/>substitute assignment with consideration given to their seniority in the District.</p>

<p>35.6.1 Efforts shall be made to keep movement of teachers from room-to-room to a<br/>minimum.</p>
<p>35.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If overcrowding requires that more than one unit member be assigned to a<br/>classroom, the Rotation or the Roving system shall be used.</p>
<p>35.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotation is defined as a system of room sharing where unit members going off¬<br/>track release their room to a unit member coming on-track. Unit members<br/>coming on-track are assigned a different classroom than they had during the<br/>previous track. Unit members change rooms every time they return from break.</p>
<p>35.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roving is defined as system of room sharing where the unit member going off¬<br/>track releases his/her room to a Roving unit member. When the unit member<br/>comes back on-tract, he/she returns to his/her original classroom, and the Roving<br/>unit member moves again.</p>
<p>35.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each cluster or grade level shall vote to decide if there will be a Roving teacher<br/>or Rotation system used. Should a Roving or Rotation system become<br/>necessary it shall occur under the following conditions:</p>
<p>35.6.5.1</p>
<p>35.6.5.2</p>
<p>35.6.5.3</p>
<p>35.6.5.4</p>
<p>35.6.5.5</p>
<p>35.6.5.6</p>

<p>A payment of one thousand dollars ($1,000) will be paid to unit<br/>members who serve as Rovers or $1,000 per Rotation team.</p>
<p>Unit members serving as Rovers will not be assigned to the staff<br/>duty schedule consisting of bus, yard, lunch, crosswalk,<br/>emergency duty and transitional duty. They will not be assigned<br/>any mandatory club, committee, or program responsibilities.</p>
<p>No teacher will be assigned a Roving position more than once in<br/>a three year period. However, Unit members may volunteer to<br/>be a Rover on a year-to-year basis.</p>
<p>Kindergarten, and Special Day Class teachers shall not be<br/>required to Rotate or serve as Rovers.</p>

<p>35.7.1 A member teaching in an on-track assignment will be permitted to exchange up<br/>to fifteen (15) consecutive instructional days with a member who is credentialed<br/>to teach the on-track member’s assignment, and who is employed at the same<br/>school site, and who is at the time in intercession or on an off-track assignment.</p>
<p>35.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exchange arrangement will be agreed to between the two members and<br/>signed by each.

<p>APPENDIX C</p>
<p>Guidelines for Leave of Absence<br/>(Differential Pay)</p>
<p>It is the intent of these guidelines to ensure that the instructional program of a<br/>class with a teacher on leave of absence (with deferential pay) will continue as if<br/>the teacher were actually there. Communication between all parties (teacher,<br/>substitute, administration) to this agreement is essential if the process is to be<br/>successful.</p>
<p>Duration of Leave of Absence</p>
<p>The leave of absence request should include a clear beginning and ending date.<br/>For example: The leave of absence shall begin (Insert Date) and will continue<br/>through (Insert Date).</p>
<p>Note: The narrative should clearly state the days the teacher will work (if any)<br/>and the days the substitute will work.</p>
<p>Communication</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be regular (at least once per week) physical contact between<br/>the teacher and substitute. The teacher and substitute should communicate<br/>by telephone as necessary to meet the needs of the students.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be regular contact between the teacher and the site<br/>administration. The teacher and administration should communicate by<br/>telephone as necessary to meet the needs of the students.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is responsible for notifying in a timely manner the administration<br/>of any situations that might alter his/her ability to fulfill obligations relative to<br/>this leave of absence.</p>
<p>Lesson Planning and Scope of Curriculum</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher shall be responsible for weekly lesson planning. Further, it is<br/>expected that the teacher provide the substitute with a general<br/>outline/timeline of the curricula to be presented during the duration of the<br/>leave.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson plans should be as nearly the same as if the teacher were<br/>conducting the class.</p>

<p>Grading and Record Maintenance</p>
<p>• The teacher shall be responsible for grading student work.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher should be sufficiently knowledgeable about each student<br/>to accurately inform a parent of his/her child's progress at any time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is responsible for keeping an accurate grade book.</p>
<p>3. The teacher is responsible for posting grades at the end of each term.</p>
<p>4. The teacher is responsible for cumulative folder maintenance</p>
<p>Note: The substitute may be involved in day-to-day grading. However, the<br/>teacher must be sufficiently familiar with the progress of each of his/her pupils to<br/>award grades, make promotion retention recommendations, etc.</p>
