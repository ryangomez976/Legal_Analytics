<p>The Board and each employee of the District have entered into an employment contract,<br/>whereby the employee has agreed to supply, for a specified time, certain designated<br/>professional services to the Board for an agreed upon salary. Said services are to be<br/>provided by the employee unless that employee is absent as authorized by action of Board<br/>or State law or by authorized leave provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>8.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that an employee who is absent from work other than for those days</p>
<p>so authorized is taking an Unauthorized Leave, which constitutes a breach of<br/>contract.</p>
<p>WVEA Agreement 2006-2009 (Ratified 10-24-07).doc</p>
<p>Page 31</p>
<p>8.12.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee, after three (3) working days of Unauthorized Leave, will<br/>be notified in writing by the District of the breach of contract. The<br/>notice will be sent by registered mail to the employee’s last known<br/>address. The Board of Trustees will likewise be so informed.</p>
<p>8.12.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will deduct a salary amount proportionate to the annual<br/>salary as the ratio of days absent on Unauthorized Leave is to the<br/>annual days of required service.</p>
<p>8.12.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is absent on Unauthorized Leave for more than three</p>
<p>(3) working days in the school term, may be subject to formal<br/>reprimand and/or suspension without pay for as much as twenty (20)<br/>working days as the Board deems appropriate under the<br/>circumstances.</p>
<p>8.12.1.4 An employee who is absent on Unauthorized Leave for five (5)</p>
<p>consecutive working days, or who fails to return to work within five (5)<br/>working days after the expiration of an authorized leave of absence,<br/>shall be deemed to have abandoned employment with the District, and<br/>such conduct shall constitute an automatic resignation of the<br/>employee, upon which the Board may exercise its option.</p>
<p>8.13 Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>The District may grant a Sabbatical Leave to employees. The purpose of such leave shall<br/>be to improve the value and quality of the employee’s work through enrichment of the<br/>employee’s training.</p>
<p>8.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of leaves granted during any one year shall not exceed one percent<br/>(1%) of the number of employees in the bargaining unit. The actual number of<br/>leaves that will be granted each year will depend upon the financial resources of<br/>the District as determined by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>8.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Sabbatical Leave will be granted until the Superintendent is satisfied that a<br/>suitable provision can be made for continuing the employee’s work during the<br/>period of the leave.</p>
<p>8.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from leave, the employee is required to render a period of service<br/>in the district equal to twice the period of the leave.</p>
<p>8.13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be eligible for Sabbatical Leave, the certificated employee must have served at<br/>least seven consecutive years as a regular full-time employee of the district. One<br/>year of regular full-time employment shall be defined as at least 75% of the<br/>teaching days of that school year. If the certificated employee has failed to serve<br/>the 75% of any school year, that shall be counted as an interruption in the<br/>seven consecutive year period.</p>
<p>8.13.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board approved leaves of absence are not considered as interruption<br/>of service for this purpose, but time spent on such leave shall not be<br/>counted toward the seven years of required service.</p>
<p>8.13.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an employee has had a Sabbatical Leave, an additional seven (7)<br/>years must be served before becoming eligible for another such leave.</p>

<p>Page 32</p>
<p>8.13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave shall be granted for not less than one semester nor more than<br/>two consecutive full semesters. Leave for a fractional part of one semester is not<br/>permitted. A Sabbatical Leave for a one-semester period will be contingent upon<br/>the availability of a suitable replacement and it is desirable that those be taken<br/>during the second semester of the school year.</p>
<p>8.13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to consider all possible applications for such leave, they must be<br/>submitted on forms provided by the personnel division by March 1 of the<br/>preceding school year.</p>
<p>8.13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests for Sabbatical Leave shall be evaluated by the Sabbatical Leave<br/>Committee. This committee shall be appointed by the Superintendent for a<br/>three year term and shall consist of the following:</p>
<p>8.13.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources (Chairman).</p>
<p>8.13.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two administrative members nominated by the administrative council,<br/>one representing the elementary schools, and one representing the<br/>secondary schools.</p>

The Association shall nominate at<br/>least two teachers for each faculty position on the committee from<br/>which the Superintendent or designee shall select the committee<br/>members.</p>
<p>8.13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation of the committee shall be made to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>8.13.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each committee member shall rank all recommended nominations in<br/>order of preference using the identified criteria.</p>
<p>8.13.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the committee shall prepare a composite ranking of<br/>the applications based upon the individual ranking of each committee<br/>member. This composite shall be forwarded to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>8.13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranking of candidates for Sabbatical Leaves shall be determined on the<br/>following criteria:</p>
<p>8.13.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential for improvement in the value and the quality of the<br/>employee’s service to the district in their present assignment.</p>
<p>8.13.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need or potential need of the district for this knowledge and/or<br/>skill on the part of the applicant after the return from leave.</p>
<p>8.13.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential impact and benefit of this knowledge and/or skill upon<br/>the total district program or staff.</p>
<p>8.13.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative merits of the reason for desiring the leave for study.</p>
<p>8.13.9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appropriateness of the study to the applicant’s future service and<br/>potential benefit to the district.</p>
<p>8.13.9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of previous leaves.</p>

<p>8.13.9.7 Priority of selection will be given to applicants who have not had a<br/>Sabbatical Leave granted by the district.</p>
<p>Approval of Leave</p>
<p>Prior to May in any given year, the Board of Trustees shall determine whether or<br/>not Sabbatical Leaves are to be funded for the following year. If Sabbatical<br/>Leaves are to be approved, then, the Board of Trustees may approve or deny the<br/>specific applications after receiving the recommendations of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>Compensation</p>
<p>Compensation for employees on Sabbatical Leave shall be not more than 3/4 of<br/>the salary which the employee would have received had he / she remained in<br/>active service, nor less than the difference between the prospective salary of the<br/>employee and that paid to the substitute employee employed in the position that<br/>is vacated by the leave.</p>
<p>8.13.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee while on leave will receive the same level of health and<br/>welfare benefits that he / she would have been entitled to if on active<br/>service.</p>
<p>8.13.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee while on leave shall not accept gainful employment<br/>without prior written approval of the Superintendent. Accepting<br/>employment without such approval shall violate the provisions of the<br/>Sabbatical Leave contract.</p>
<p>The compensation while on leave will be paid in the same manner as if the<br/>employee were on duly in the district upon the furnishing by the employee of a<br/>Sabbatical Leave of absence agreement and suitable indemnification bond. The<br/>bond shall indemnify the district against losses in the event the employee fails to<br/>render two years of service to the Walnut Valley Unified School District after<br/>returning from leave of absence or should the employee fail to fulfill the<br/>Sabbatical Leave provisions.</p>
<p>Such bonds shall be exonerated and the agreement fulfilled in the event that the<br/>failure of such employee to return and render such two years of service is<br/>caused by death or incapacitating physical or mental disability of the employee.<br/>This district for good cause, may exonerate the bond in the event of a<br/>resignation by the employee during or at the completion of the sabbatical or any<br/>time within the two years after return to the district.</p>
<p>8.13.12.1 In the event the employee does not wish to furnish a bond as</p>
<p>described in the preceding paragraph, the compensation shall be paid<br/>in two equal installments during the first two years of service rendered<br/>in the employment of the district following the return of the employee<br/>from said leave of absence, one-half of the total compensation will be<br/>paid at the end of the first year after the return. The second<br/>installment shall be paid at the end of the second year after the return<br/>of the employee from leave. No leaves of absence, with or without pay,<br/>will be granted at the conclusion of the Sabbatical Leave unless the<br/>bond specified above is extended to include a period of service two<br/>years beyond the expiration of the leave.</p>
<p>Sabbatical Leave time shall be counted toward retirement and annuity<br/>contributions shall be collected.</p>

<p>Page 34</p>
<p>8.13.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ninety (90) days after the resumption of service, the employee, who has<br/>been on Sabbatical Leave, shall file with the Sabbatical Leave committee a<br/>comprehensive report certifying the successfulness of the terms and conditions<br/>from which the leave was granted. This comprehensive report shall include:</p>
<p>8.13.14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official transcripts of all completed coursework and/or degrees earned<br/>and a copy of all pertinent materials developed during the leave.</p>
<p>8.13.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations of how the Sabbatical Leave results may be shared<br/>with staff and/or students.</p>
<p>8.13.14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to satisfactorily provide this report shall constitute a failure of<br/>leave conditions and shall result in forfeit of all leave compensation.<br/>That determination shall be made by the Superintendent, after<br/>receiving recommendation from the Sabbatical Leave Committee. The<br/>employee may resubmit the report to the committee which will forward<br/>it to the Superintendent with a recommendation. Should the<br/>Superintendent reject the second report, the employee may appeal to<br/>the Board whose decision will be final.</p>
<p>8.13.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interruption of program of study or research caused by a serious incapacitating<br/>accident or illness during the Sabbatical Leave shall not prejudice the<br/>employee’s fulfillment of the conditions under which the leave was granted. Nor<br/>shall such interruption affect the amount of compensation to be paid to the<br/>employee under the terms of the leave. However, the preceding conditions shall<br/>only exist if the Superintendent receives evidence which is satisfactory to<br/>him/her demonstrating the nature and severity of the incapacitation. That<br/>evidence shall be presented in person or sent by registered letter within ten days<br/>of such accident or onset of illness. If unusual circumstances exist, such<br/>evidence will be presented at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>8.13.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the expiration of the Sabbatical Leave, the employee shall be assigned to a<br/>position equivalent to the one held prior to the leave. If the position is not<br/>available, then the district policies and procedures for transfer and assignment<br/>shall apply. Sabbatical Leave service shall count as a service period for longevity<br/>purposes.</p>
<p>8.13.16.1 The employee shall receive service increments, salary reclassifications<br/>and any of the benefits to which such employee would have been<br/>entitled had he/she continued on active service. (Excluding extra<br/>compensation of any type.)</p>

<p>ARTICLE 9: EMPLOYEE/PUPIL RATIOS AND CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will strive to keep individual as well as average class sizes at a level that<br/>promotes the educational program as dictated by the financial conditions of the district,<br/>the building facilities available, the availability of qualified teachers, changes in enrollment<br/>and attendance or other valid reasons.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with this the district is committed to maintaining an overall teacher-student<br/>ratio of 1:27.4, plus or minus .4, these ratios to be implemented at the time of filing the<br/>October enrollment report and the second period report for the year.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall not be hindered in its flexibility in utilizing instructional groupings<br/>different from the historically standard classroom, e.g., large group instruction,<br/>cooperative teaching teams, etc.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high schools and middle schools when it becomes necessary to assign more than<br/>forty (40) students to any single class session with one teacher, the responsible<br/>administrator shall meet with that teacher and a representative of the Association to<br/>consider alternatives. The administrator shall consider the following criteria when making<br/>his/her decision.</p>
<p>9.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The educational well being of the student.</p>
<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability and size of similar classes.</p>
<p>9.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of qualified or experienced teachers to teach the class.</p>
<p>Exceptions to this provision shall be for classes which require large numbers<br/>such as band, drill team, chorus, athletics, etc., or classes as part of a pilot<br/>program.</p>
<p>9.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the class sizes in physical education in grades 6 through 12 be<br/>increased so that they average 47 students per class and will not exceed 50<br/>students in any one class. This may be reviewed as a part of ongoing<br/>negotiations.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In secondary schools, the administrator-in-charge, when requested after the fifth week of<br/>each semester, shall provide the organization with a certificated staff utilization summary<br/>including the allocated number of certificated staffing units.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will abide by class size limitations established under the Education Code.</p>
<p>9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In elementary schools after the third week of school when a 4th or 5th grade class<br/>enrollment exceeds 35 students, one hour per day of instructional aide assistance shall be<br/>offered to the teacher. That will be increased in one half-hour increments for each<br/>additional student. Similar assistance shall be offered when the enrollment in a<br/>combination class, (K-l, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4) in the primary grades, exceeds 31 students or when<br/>a 4-5 combination exceeds 33.</p>
<p>In extraordinary circumstances, and subject to review under the provisions of Article 6,<br/>exceptions to the above provisions may be made by the District.</p>

<p>When employees covered by this agreement accept such assignments, they shall<br/>be compensated additionally for those assignments when they involve time and<br/>responsibilities beyond the time and obligations of the regular on-site workday<br/>as specified in Article V, but shall not be compensated additionally to the extent<br/>such assignments are included as part of the assignment responsibility within<br/>the regular workday.</p>
<p>Compensation for such assignments shall be based upon the compensation<br/>point total for each such assignment as determined by the district’s criterion<br/>system for extra pay assignments and attached as Appendix B.</p>
<p>For those high school extra-curricular activities intended as profit-making<br/>events conducted by student government or authorized student organizations,<br/>employees will not be required to supervise such events without compensation.</p>

<p>The event time period for payment purposes shall be based on an established<br/>average time for each event. The unit member shall be responsible for the<br/>average time for each event. Such activities shall not include those described in<br/>Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of this Agreement. There shall also be a separate<br/>instructional rate as provided for in Section 10.7.6.7 below.</p>

<p>10.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees appointed to and accepting certain special assignments during the<br/>regular school year, which require service and responsibility beyond that of a<br/>full-time classroom teacher’s responsibility, will be paid according to the Special<br/>Assignments Salary Schedule attached as Appendix B.</p>
<p>10.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Contract Provisions</p>
<p>10.14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shared Contract Program is a plan whereby two (2) teachers share the<br/>responsibilities and the contract of employment of one (1) identifiable full-time<br/>position.</p>
<p>10.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must be permanent teachers with appropriate credential(s) willing<br/>to provide a written commitment to serve a minimum of one (1) year in the<br/>shared position.</p>
<p>10.14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall submit a Shared Contract Agreement Form to their immediate<br/>administrator and the principal indicating the names of the participants,<br/>position affected, and department affected, the proposed sharing schedule and<br/>the potential benefit to the District. Mutual agreement between the two (2)<br/>teachers, the immediate administrator, the principal and the Assistant<br/>Superintendent, Human Resources, is required before the plan can be<br/>implemented. Proposals submitted by teachers shall include:</p>
<p>10.14.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How they will share the position.</p>
<p>10.14.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification that their classroom philosophy is mutually acceptable<br/>and consistent.</p>
<p>10.14.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assurance that curricular and instructional strengths will be used to<br/>the best advantage for their students.</p>
<p>10.14.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific plan, which outlines tasks, schedules, curricular program,<br/>report cards, conferences, testing, etc.</p>
<p>10.14.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A detailed plan for establishing communications with each other,<br/>students, staff and parents.</p>

<p>10.14.12</p>
<p>Shared contracts shall be written for one (1) year only. Both parties in a shared<br/>contract shall agree to the contract each year for one (1) full year to maintain the<br/>contract.</p>
<p>Salary will be a prorated share at the appropriate column and step of the salary<br/>schedule a teacher would have earned if the teacher had not elected to exercise<br/>the option of part-time employment. Contributions to the appropriate<br/>retirement system will be based upon the prorated salary actually earned by the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>Teachers approved for a shared contract must request a leave of absence for the<br/>portion of their contract that equates to the percent needed to complete their<br/>full-time contracts. Teachers on a shared contract must reapply each year.</p>
<p>Each teacher sharing a contract will receive district-paid benefits.</p>
<p>10.14.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on a shared contract shall receive a proportionate amount of<br/>Health and Welfare Benefits (i.e., medical, dental, vision and life<br/>insurance) in accordance with the following formula:</p>
<p>(Percentage of contract worked) X (Benefit Package Selected) = District<br/>Contribution.</p>
<p>10.14.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any balance due to cover the selected Health and Welfare Benefit<br/>Package shall be paid by the teacher through payroll deduction.</p>
<p>Both teachers will be required to attend staff meetings on the days they are<br/>teaching, all Pupil/Pupil Free Days, start of school pre-service planning days,<br/>PQR/WASC Accreditation meetings, Back-to-School Night, and Open House<br/>unless prior approval is received from the principal.</p>
<p>Job Share</p>
<p>Both teachers accepting the job share assignment will be required to attend the<br/>first day of student instruction and up to two additional days of service,<br/>compensated at the daily rate of the job share employee. The two additional<br/>days of service shall be mutually agreed upon by the site administrator(s) and<br/>those teachers involved in the job share. The two additional days will be<br/>excluded from section 10.14.8.</p>
<p>If a teacher on shared contract is absent, the teaching partner may substitute<br/>for the absent teacher in a regular substitute status at the regular substitute<br/>rate. This will require that the teaching partner be an authorized substitute in<br/>advance. It does not necessitate that either party agree to substitute at any<br/>other time; however, they may do so if they choose.</p>
<p>A shared contract can be terminated by the District upon showing that the<br/>termination is in the best educational interest. The contract-sharing<br/>participants affected shall be given a written statement of the reason(s) for the<br/>termination. Upon termination of the contract sharing, teachers affected shall<br/>be offered full-time positions in an equivalent position. Failure to accept a full¬<br/>time position shall be considered resignation.</p>
<p>If one of the participants in the Shared Contract Program should resign, change<br/>leave status, or return to full-time employment, the position being vacated shall<br/>be filled by the remaining teacher if they so request for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>WVEA Agreement 2006-2009 (Ratified 10-24-07).doc</p>
<p>Page 45</p>
<p>10.14.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of the contract-sharing assignment, a request to be reinstated<br/>as a full-time teacher will be handled as a voluntary teacher initiated transfer<br/>resulting in a return to the most appropriate opening available.</p>
<p>10.14.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revisions or termination of the Shared Contract Program will not modify the<br/>status of existing agreements for the balance of the existing school year. Any<br/>extension of a shared contract is subject to any revisions.</p>
<p>10.14.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance Incentive</p>
<p>When developing the substitute teacher budget, the district will allocate nine (9)<br/>days of illness absence for each teacher projected in September to be employed<br/>for the entire school year.</p>
<p>10.14.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the school year, all unused money in this portion of the substitute<br/>teacher budget (less the clerk time amount indicated in 10.11.2.1 below) shall be<br/>allocated toward an attendance incentive fund. At the end of the year each<br/>teacher who has been absent live or less days due to illness (proportionately less<br/>if employed less than the full year) will share in this fund. Each day of unused<br/>Sick Leave of each eligible member will comprise one share of the fund. Each<br/>eligible participant will receive one share for each day of unused Sick Leave that<br/>they have remaining from the year. Participating unit members will receive a<br/>supplemental payment or their share of the incentive fund some time after July</p>
<p>1 and before September 1.</p>
<p>10.14.16.1 When determining the amount of funds remaining in the fund, the</p>
<p>district shall deduct the equivalent of the average salary and benefits<br/>for a quarter time clerk to provide for the record keeping and payroll<br/>processing for his/her program.</p>
<p>10.14.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effectiveness of the absence incentive program will be reviewed annually<br/>with its continuation to be mutually agreed upon prior to August 30 of each<br/>year.</p>

<p>11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is committed to providing Health and Welfare Benefits (fringe benefits) for<br/>each eligible full-time employee and his/her eligible dependents, including medical,<br/>dental, vision and life insurance protection. The District and Association agree to define<br/>eligible dependents as spouses, children up to their twenty-first (21st) birthday or until<br/>their twenty-third (23rd) birthday, if they maintain full-time student status (defined as 12<br/>semester units or the equivalent in an accredited institution). In addition, over-age<br/>dependents with qualifying disabilities, are eligible for continuation of coverage, when a<br/>doctor's certification is provided. Less than full-time employees shall receive fringe benefits<br/>proportionate to their part-time status.</p>
<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost Containment Participation</p>
<p>In recognition of the anticipated increases to employee fringe benefits, WVEA agrees to<br/>study with the District, through the Insurance Committee comprised of representatives<br/>from all employee groups, and pursue opportunities to contain future costs of benefits,<br/>while maintaining benefits as best as possible. Options may include but are not limited to<br/>revisions of current benefit offerings and plan design, moving to a larger pool of employees,<br/>and monitoring closely plan utilization and wellness programs designed to reduce claims.</p>
<p>11.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees employed for the first time for the 1994/95 fiscal year will have the<br/>option of selecting from one of the District’s medical plans. If the employee<br/>selects a program other than the Kaiser medical plan, then the District will<br/>contribute up to the cost of the Kaiser family premium toward the cost of the<br/>program selected.</p>
<p>11.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective October 1, 1996 for employees employed before June 30, 1994, covered<br/>by paragraph 11.1.1 who are not participating in Kaiser family medical<br/>insurance and the premium for his/her total medical coverage exceeds the cost<br/>of the Kaiser family coverage, the District will pay 50% of the difference between<br/>the Kaiser family rate and the premium required for any other available plan.</p>
<p>11.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Shield Preferred Provider Option (PPO) would not be immediately<br/>available to new teachers hired after May 1, 2006 who have not previously<br/>participated in the District medical plan(s). Once tenured, these teachers may<br/>opt to be included in the PPO plan at subsequent open enrollment periods.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees working less than full-time, but at least half-time, will have a proportionate<br/>amount (same proportion as their working time to full-time) contributed to the medical<br/>insurance premium under the same conditions applicable to full-time employees.</p>
<p>11.3.1 The less-than-full-time employees will be personally responsible for payment of<br/>the difference between the amount contributed by the Board and the premium<br/>and may authorize a salary warrant deduction for the purpose of paying that<br/>portion of the premium for which the employees are responsible.</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employees working three-fourths time or more, the District will provide the agreed<br/>upon dental insurance for the employee and their eligible dependents.</p>
<p>For employees working three-fourths time or more, the District will provide the agreed<br/>upon vision insurance program for the employee and their eligible dependents.</p>
<p>WVEA Agreement 2006-2009 (Ratified 10-24-07).doc</p>
<p>Page 47</p>
<p>11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a member of the bargaining unit is able to provide proof of other medical insurance,<br/>then he/she may receive, in lieu of that selection, an amount of cash equal to the annual<br/>Kaiser single party contribution in effect for 2006 ($3,370 per year). This will be paid<br/>tenthly, October through July and prorated for those employees employed for less than the<br/>entire year.</p>
<p>11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouse of Bargaining Unit Member</p>
<p>If the cost of the program selected by the district employed couple is greater than the cost<br/>of the Kaiser Family Premium, the District will pay 50% of the difference between the cost<br/>of the Kaiser Family Plan and the premium for the selected program. The other 50% of the<br/>difference will be deducted from the bargaining unit member currently enrolled in medical<br/>insurance benefits. The dependent spouse will retain his or her pro-rata cash-in-lieu<br/>benefits. The spouse will pay 50% between the difference in their selected coverage and<br/>the Kaiser family rate. If that difference exceeds the dependent spouse’s cash-in-lieu<br/>benefit, the married couple would not have to contribute beyond the cash-in-lieu amount.</p>
<p>This language meets the IRS recommended guidelines.</p>
<p>11.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance Committee</p>
<p>11.8.1 The District and Association agree to participate in an insurance committee,</p>
<p>which shall be established for the following purposes:</p>
<p>11.8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide an avenue for discussing the District's current fringe benefits<br/>program, as well as evaluate the benefits associated with new<br/>programs for the purpose of making recommendations for<br/>implementation.</p>
<p>11.8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve as an Advisory Committee for the purpose of providing<br/>information, in a collaborative style, to the negotiating bodies and the<br/>general membership of the employee organizations.</p>
<p>11.8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work to preserve an affordable level of fringe benefits through cost-<br/>containing efforts, including regular plan design review of co¬<br/>payments and deductibles, as well as utilization review, to ensure<br/>maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>11.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the district paid life insurance benefit for the Certificated<br/>Bargaining Unit to $35,000.</p>

<p>3.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is defined as the importance and demands placed upon the<br/>assignment by the crowd, community, administration, and<br/>Board of Trustees. It includes the amount of exposure,<br/>frequency, attendance, quality demanded, and the ramifications<br/>of poor performance.</p>
<p>3.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum pressure in such an assignment would be one<br/>that was expected to produce certain accomplishments beyond<br/>the normal routine or face dismissal. One with minimal<br/>pressures would be on with little or no outside awareness of the<br/>results of the activity.</p>

For example, a person who<br/>handles a few dollars does not rate as high as one who handles<br/>hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influence</p>
<p>3.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is determined by the amount of adverse environmental<br/>conditions the advisor must endure.</p>
<p>3.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches who must practice outside regardless of the weather<br/>would be the maximum.</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computation of Assignment Value</p>
<p>The separate values of each criterion is determined by multiplying the number of points<br/>allocated to the position times its weighted value. These sub-totals are then added to<br/>determine the grand total for the individual position.</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for Review</p>
<p>5.1 A permanent committee on Extra Pay Assignments will be established. Its</p>
<p>purpose will be to consider and recommend modification of any individual extra<br/>pay assignment or the placement of any new extra pay assignment. The<br/>committee’s recommendation shall be forwarded to the Board through the<br/>Superintendent.</p>

<p>PEER ASSISTANCE AND PEER REVIEW (PAR)</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>MAY 24, 2000</p>
<p>PURPOSE: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Walnut Valley Educators Association (WVEA) and the Walnut Valley Unified</p>
<p>School District (WVUSD) are continuously striving to provide the highest possible quality of<br/>education for our clients. In order for students to succeed in learning, teachers must succeed in<br/>teaching. Therefore, the WVEA and WVUSD agree to cooperate in the design and implementation<br/>of programs to improve the quality of instruction through expanded opportunities for professional<br/>development and peer assistance. Volunteer teachers, as well as those who have been referred to<br/>participate in the Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program, are viewed as valuable<br/>professionals who shall have the appropriate resources provided to them in the interest of<br/>enhancing their performance.</p>
<p>The extent of the PAR Program’s assistance and review depends on whether the participating<br/>permanent teacher is a volunteer teacher, or a teacher who has received an unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation in the areas of knowledge of subject matter, teaching methods or instruction as<br/>indicated in their Professional Growth Plan (PGP5). The Program’s assistance shall be provided<br/>through Consulting Teachers who have been identified for their exemplary professional skills.</p>
<p>I. Joint Committee</p>

The Administrative Director of Human Resources will be<br/>an ex officio member with the responsibility to facilitate the recommendations of the<br/>Joint Committee.

This new member<br/>would fulfill the remainder of that term.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee shall establish its own meeting schedule. To conduct an official<br/>meeting, at least three teachers and two administrators from the Joint Committee must<br/>be present. Teachers who are members of the Joint Committee shall be released from<br/>their regular duties to attend meetings, without loss of pay or benefits. If, in carrying<br/>out their responsibilities as members of the Joint Committee, teachers find it necessary<br/>to work beyond the workday, they shall be compensated at the unit member's pro rata<br/>hourly rate of pay.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in annual training along with certificated and district evaluators;<br/>training may include effective instructional strategies, standards, consensus building,<br/>student achievement, classroom management, and legal issues applicable to the<br/>California Peer Assistance and Peer Review Program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing its own rules of procedure, including the method for the selection of a<br/>chairperson.</p>

Any reports to the Joint<br/>Committee or personnel files will be made only as specified by the unit member.</p>
