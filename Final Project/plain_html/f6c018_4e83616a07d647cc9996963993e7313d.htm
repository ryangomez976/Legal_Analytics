<p>Adjunct duties consist of service on district committees and site committees as<br/>well as site activities other than professional duties. Adjunct duties may be<br/>related to curricular expertise and/or professional experience and, as such,<br/>participation ensures involvement and a voice in the important activities of the<br/>district. Examples of adjunct duties are listed in Appendix E. Adjunct duties in<br/>excess of 15 hours shall be paid at the extra hire rate.</p>
<p>.1 The distribution of adjunct duties should be fair, equitable and transparent. Each<br/>site shall have a process for selection that is mutually agreeable for all<br/>stakeholders. The process by which adjunct duties are assigned shall include a<br/>review of committees and other adjunct duties no later than the beginning of<br/>each school year. These committees will have an estimated number of hours it<br/>will take for the year and shall be posted next to each committee/adjunct duty.<br/>Positions to be filled first will be those necessary to make the district and the<br/>school run according to Education Code (e.g., Site Council, 504, etc.). Staff will<br/>sign up according to interest. Once these positions have been filled, those<br/>chosen by staff/administrator will be filled in order of priority. Once it appears<br/>important committees and adjunct duties have been filled, staff/administrator will<br/>review remaining committees and determine importance.</p>
<p>.2 A teacher will inform site principal if adjunct duty is within 3 hours of the 15 hours.<br/>Teacher/administrator will meet to discuss options- including previously<br/>mentioned compensation at the hourly rate.</p>
<p>.3 Unit members shall participate in at least one adjunct duty annually. The choice<br/>of which adjunct duty is voluntary.</p>
<p>.4 Participation in Bargaining Committees or DTA will not be considered an adjunct<br/>duty and does not count toward the expected adjunct duty participation by unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>.5 Special education teachers who attend lEP’s beyond 15 hours of the regular<br/>school day, will be compensated at the district hourly rate for the IEP meeting<br/>time once 15 hours have been met.

<p>4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-lnstructional Days</p>
<p>On those days of the school calendar year when students are not in attendance,<br/>the hours of employment shall be determined by the on-site administrator after<br/>consultation with the faculty, provided that the total hours shall not exceed a<br/>normal work day.</p>
<p>4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Certificated Employees</p>
<p>.1 The hours of employment of psychologists, nurses and other non¬<br/>classroom teachers or members of the unit shall be proportional to the<br/>hours of employment of classroom teachers as cited above, and shall take<br/>into account the different professional demands regarding pacing of the<br/>work hours needed to accomplish these tasks. The precise determination<br/>of the hours of employment for such employees shall be made by the<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>.2 Counselors shall have the same work days as teachers but shall be on<br/>duty an additional twelve (12) work days during the year. The scheduling<br/>of the twelve (12) work days shall be mutually agreed to between the<br/>counselor and the site administrator.

<p>17</p>
<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT (Continued)</p>
<p>the work year and consider possible reduction of the three (3) professional<br/>development days.</p>
<p>Since compensation for the three (3) professional development days will be<br/>reflected on the Dixie Certificated Salary Schedule, attendance on the part of the<br/>unit member is mandatory.</p>
<p>If unit members are unable to attend professional development days because of<br/>personal necessity, they must secure advanced permission except for the<br/>reasons listed in 6.5.1a and b.</p>

Individual permanent teachers wishing to job<br/>share during the next school year must file a letter of interest with the<br/>Principal and Superintendent by February 15 prior to the school year the<br/>job share will become effective.</p>
<p>a. By March 1, the Superintendent will publish a list of persons who<br/>have expressed an interest in shared contract employment based<br/>on requests received.</p>
<p>.2 Teachers wishing to share a position shall submit a proposal by April 1.<br/>The written request will include the reasons for the job share proposal. It<br/>will specify the benefits to the District, students and employees involved.<br/>The written request will indicate the names of the employees who are<br/>proposing to job share and how the employees plan to implement the job<br/>share position. The request must show details of how the teachers intend<br/>to coordinate their work, share information from Learning Wednesdays<br/>and in-services, and ensure the continuity of the class.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a job share partner is not found among current permanent<br/>employees, the District has the option to employ a temporary or<br/>substitute employee as a job share partner.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared contracts are authorized by the Superintendent for one<br/>school year at a time and must be renewed by application each<br/>year.</p>

The site Principal shall indicate any areas of concern to<br/>the teachers prior to March 15 so that these concerns may be<br/>addressed in the revised proposal.</p>
<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT (Continued)</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>d. Teachers wishing to continue a job sharing arrangement beyond<br/>two school years may re-submit their proposal with any necessary<br/>changes. At the discretion of the site Principal, the extended<br/>shared contract proposal will be sent to the Superintendent for<br/>district review and approval. However, priority will be given to<br/>newly developed shared contract proposals between two<br/>permanent teachers at the site who have not had a shared contract<br/>proposal previously granted. Contract limits on numbers of shared<br/>contracts per site and per grade level will be maintained. (4.10.6)</p>
<p>.3 Shared contracts shall be approved by the Board of Trustees upon<br/>recommendation of the Superintendent based on input from the site<br/>Principal. Approval shall be determined by an assessment of the<br/>proposal, meeting the needs of the school involved as well as those of the<br/>employees. Approval shall also be determined by the District’s ability to<br/>obtain suitable replacement for the opening created by the job share.</p>
<p>a. Notification will be provided in writing no later than May 1 to the</p>
<p>employees making a job share request, following submission of the<br/>written request. Should the request be denied, the Superintendent<br/>shall provide the reasons in writing to the applicants at the time of<br/>notification.</p>
<p>.4 It is understood that the pay and benefits equivalent to one full-time</p>
<p>employee will be shared by the two job-sharing employees. Salary and<br/>benefits will be shared, proportionately, to the days or periods worked by<br/>each member of the job share. In no event will the sum of the two<br/>employees’ pro-rata portions of the wages and benefits constitute pay or<br/>benefits greater than one full-time position. There shall also be pro-rata<br/>apportionment of duties between the job-sharing partners. There will be<br/>no shared contract with less than two days per week per employee.<br/>Teachers will go up a step on the salary schedule each time they have<br/>accumulated 75% of a full year (135 days). The salary increase will go<br/>into effect at the beginning of the next school year. Such accumulation of<br/>part time experience must take place within a two-year consecutive<br/>period. Day-to-day substitute time is not allowed for this provision.</p>
<p>.5 In order to facilitate coordination with other teachers, support staff and the<br/>community, both partners will attend Back to School Night, Open House,<br/>non-student work days, conference days, and in-service days. Each<br/>teacher is responsible to fully inform the job sharing partner of meetings<br/>held on a day when that partner is not working.</p>
<p>a. The job share partners share the proportional responsibilities of 15<br/>additional hours of Learning Wednesdays. [See Section 4.2.1]</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT (Continued)</p>
<p>b. If an employee is required by an administrator to work on a non¬<br/>work day (Section 1.5 excluded), the employee will be<br/>compensated at the extra hire rate. Five working days’ notice will<br/>be given to the employee.</p>
<p>.6 There will be a limit of no more than a ratio of 1:7 shared contract classes<br/>to full- time contract classes at each District school site. There will be a<br/>limit of one job share at a grade level at a school site. Should there be<br/>more requests than openings at one school site or grade level, the option<br/>may be given to move to another grade level or site. Should requests<br/>exceed the ratio district wide, then final approval will depend on the merit<br/>of the proposal, but no more than a ratio of 1:7 per school site will be<br/>allowed.</p>
<p>.7 If a job sharer is out for an extended illness, the remaining partner will be<br/>encouraged to take over the full assignment and be paid at the substitute<br/>rate. For short term illnesses, partners will be encouraged to cover for<br/>each other when possible. If a substitute is needed, district policy will<br/>prevail. The Principal will give final approval. (See Article 3.2)</p>
<p>.8 Full-time permanent, certificated employees opting for a shared contract<br/>may, at their option, return to full-time employment the following year.<br/>They must notify their intent to the principal and Superintendent by<br/>February 15 prior to the school year they wish to return to full-time status.</p>
<p>.9 Employees who are on shared contracts are on unpaid leave for that<br/>percentage of the year they are not employed.</p>
<p>.10 If, during a school year, the need arises for a teacher to share a contract,<br/>he or she should submit a proposal to the site Principal. If the proposal is<br/>valid and within the limits outlined in Article 4.10, the administrator will<br/>bring the request to the Superintendent for consideration.</p>
<p>4.11 Part-Time Teacher</p>
<p>. 1 Part time contracts shall be approved by the Board of Trustees upon<br/>recommendation of the Superintendent based on input from the site<br/>Principal. Approval shall be determined by meeting the needs of the<br/>school involved as well as those of the employee.</p>

<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT (Continued)</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>.2 It is understood that pay and benefits are prorated at the employee's</p>
<p>position on the salary schedule. Part time teachers will continue their step<br/>increases at their pro rated rate providing they have met the requirement<br/>of teaching 75% of the days.</p>
<p>.3 In order to facilitate coordination with other teachers, support staff and the<br/>community, part time teachers will attend Back-to-School Night and Open<br/>House.</p>
<p>In addition, the following expectations apply to part-time teachers contracted at<br/>60% or higher.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-service (SIP) days must be attended in order for individuals to be<br/>paid.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time teachers will assume their percentage of the additional 15<br/>hours for after Learning Wednesday and professional and adjunct<br/>duties.</p>
<p>.4 If requesting part time employment, there is no guarantee that a teacher<br/>will get the same schedule each year due to enrollment and site needs<br/>that may vary from year to year.</p>
<p>.5 Permanent certificated teachers working part time may request full time<br/>status for the following year. They must notify their intent to the Principal<br/>and Superintendent by February 15 prior to the school year they wish to<br/>obtain full time status.</p>

<p>.1 An employee who is, or whose family member is, suffering from a</p>
<p>catastrophic illness or injury may request donations of accrued sick leave<br/>or vacation credits under the catastrophic leave program.</p>
<p>.2 Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, or that<br/>incapacitates a member of the employee’s family (spouse, child, parent or<br/>domestic partner) whose incapacity requires the employee to take time off<br/>from work for an extended period of time to care for that family member,<br/>and taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the<br/>employee because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave<br/>and other paid time off.</p>
<p>.3 The Superintendent or his or her designee shall determine whether an<br/>employee has suffered a catastrophic or life threatening sickness or<br/>accident rendering the employee eligible to receive transferred sick leave.<br/>The Superintendent or his/her designee’s decision shall be final.</p>
<p>.4 Upon requesting donations under this program, the employee shall</p>
<p>provide verification of the catastrophic injury or illness. Verification shall<br/>be made by means of a letter or other communication, dated and signed<br/>by the sick or injured person’s physician, indicating the incapacitating<br/>nature and probable duration of the illness or injury.</p>

All<br/>transfers of eligible leave credit shall be irrevocable.</p>
<p>.9 To ensure that employees retain sufficient accrued sick leave to meet</p>
<p>needs that normally arise, donors shall not reduce their accumulated sick<br/>leave to fewer than twenty (20) work days.</p>
<p>. 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefitting employees may use donated sick leave credits for a maximum</p>
<p>of thirty (30) work days.</p>
<p>.11 An employee who receives paid leave pursuant to this program shall use<br/>any leave credits that he or she continues to accrue on a monthly basis<br/>before receiving paid leave pursuant to this program.</p>
<p>.12 The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all donations are<br/>confidential.</p>
<p>6.14 General Provisions</p>
<p>Provisions of Sick Leave, Extended Disability Leave, Maternity Disability,<br/>Personal Necessity, Industrial Accident/lllness, Bereavement, Jury<br/>Duty/Subpoenaed Witness Leaves, Family Care and Medical Leave, and<br/>Catastrophic Leave shall not be construed to apply to any employee during any<br/>period when the employee would not normally be performing services for the<br/>District.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>EVALUATION</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the evaluation process is to promote continuous improvement of</p>
<p>unit member performance through both formative and summative methods.</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members assigned to one site will be evaluated by the on-site administrator.<br/>Unit members assigned to more than one site or will be evaluated by an<br/>administrator designated by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary unit members shall participate annually in the<br/>Summative Assessment process until they achieve permanent status. At least<br/>two formal scheduled observations and one informal unscheduled observation<br/>shall occur by December 1 and February 1.</p>
<p>.1 Probationary and temporary unit members hired after December 1 shall<br/>receive a written evaluation prior to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members shall participate annually in either the Summative or<br/>Formative Assessment process according to the Teacher Evaluation Cycle chart<br/>in Evaluation Appendix C.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members and evaluators shall adhere to all timelines for the Formative and<br/>Summative Assessments in Evaluation Appendix D.</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Summative Assessment year, both scheduled and unscheduled<br/>observations shall be part of the evaluation process. There shall be at least one<br/>formal and one informal observation for classroom teachers.</p>
<p>The observation shall be preceded by a conference in which the evaluator and<br/>the unit member review what is going to occur during the, observation. Following<br/>the observation there shall be a post-observation meeting.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is informed of concerns on an observation shall, upon<br/>request, be entitled to one (1) subsequent observation. If there is an additional<br/>formal observation and the concern persists, a Professional Assistance Plan,<br/>Awareness Phase (AP-1) shall be prepared to address those concerns.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summative Assessment Report (S-9) shall include recommendations, if<br/>necessary, as to suggestions for improvement in the performance of the unit<br/>member. The evaluator will confer with the unit member, make specific<br/>recommendations and provide appropriate assistance to the unit member.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summative Assessment Report (S-9) shall be in three copies, with a copy<br/>presented to the unit member at least forty-five (45) days before the end of the<br/>school year. The signature of the unit member being evaluated does not indicate</p>
<p>EVALUATION (Continued)</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>agreement with the evaluation, only that a copy was received and a conference<br/>was held. Distribution of the three signed copies is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to be presented to the person evaluated.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to be retained in the administrator’s file.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to be placed in the unit member’s District Personnel File at the<br/>District Office.</p>
<p>7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member may provide a written response to be attached to the final<br/>evaluation which shall be a part of the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsubstantiated statements proceeding from rumor or gossip shall not be a basis<br/>for evaluation of unit members.</p>
<p>7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that the performance of the instructional assistants<br/>adversely affect the evaluation of unit members. In the event that a unit member<br/>believes that an assigned instructional assistant is not performing in the best<br/>interest of the educational program, the unit member shall confer with the<br/>building administrator to establish a procedure designed to improve the<br/>assistant’s performance. Inadequate performance on the part of a unit member’s<br/>instructional assistants shall not be attributed to the unit member, except to the<br/>extent that the unit member can reasonably be expected to direct the assistant’s<br/>performance.</p>
<p>7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Self Assessment and Growth Survey Continuum of Teaching Practice (S-<br/>1/F-1) should be used by unit members to clarify and enrich the discussion. The<br/>Self Assessment and Growth Survey (Form S-1) is to be used by the teacher for<br/>reference and is not to be given to the administrator conducting the evaluations.</p>
<p>7.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not evaluate other unit members as part of the evaluation<br/>process.</p>
<p>7.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be held accountable for any aspect of the educational<br/>program which they reasonably cannot be expected to correct.</p>
<p>7.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private life of a unit member, including religious or political beliefs or<br/>organizational activities, shall not be a part of the evaluation except as it may<br/>prevent the unit member from performing assigned functions during the workday.</p>
<p>7.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Does Not Meet Standards evaluation of classroom performance shall not be<br/>predicated upon a unit member’s use of “controversial” materials provided that<br/>such materials are consistent with the age and maturity level of the students and<br/>the District’s educational and curriculum guidelines and policies.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>EVALUATION (Continued)</p>
<p>7.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of updating and improving evaluation procedures, the Association<br/>and District agree, to the formation of a Teacher Evaluation Committee. The<br/>Association and the District shall each appoint a mutually agreed upon number of<br/>members to the committee, which shall include classroom teachers, site and<br/>district-level personnel. Meetings will be scheduled to take place on released<br/>time or after school, depending on the purpose of the meeting involved. All<br/>findings from the committee shall be referred to the District and the Association<br/>for negotiations as necessary.</p>
<p>7.18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Not Meet Standards</p>
<p>.1 A “Does not meet Dixie School District Standards for the California</p>
<p>Standards for the Teaching Profession” evaluation is given when the unit<br/>member receives a Does not meet rating in two (2) standards on the<br/>Summative Assessment Report (S-9). An evaluator shall not give a “Does<br/>Not Meet Standards” evaluation unless the unit member has been given a<br/>Professional Assistance Plan, Awareness Phase (AP-1) not less than 45<br/>days prior to the Summative Assessment Report (S-11).</p>
<p>.2 In the event the unit member receives a “Does Not Meet Standards” on<br/>the Summative Assessment Report (S-9), a meeting will be held within 30<br/>calendar days between the evaluator and the unit member at which the<br/>identified problems are presented. Professional Assistance Plan,<br/>Professional Support Phase (AP-2) shall be jointly prepared. The unit<br/>member may be accompanied by an Association representative. If the unit<br/>member requests, the Superintendent shall also attend such meeting. The<br/>District shall assist the unit member in implementing the Professional<br/>Assistance Plan.</p>
<p>.3 If the unit member receives a”Does Not Meet Standards”, it shall be the<br/>obligation of the evaluator to evaluate the unit member again the following<br/>December and April (March for probationary unit members).</p>
<p>.4 If the unit member does not agree with a “Does Not Meet Standards”<br/>evaluation, he/she shall have the right of appeal to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall review the evaluation and meet with the unit<br/>member, and an Association representative, if desired by the unit<br/>member, to discuss the evaluation.</p>
<p>.5 If the unit member is not satisfied with the results of the meeting with the<br/>Superintendent, he/she shall have the right to appeal to the Governing<br/>Board which shall hear the matter in closed session. An Association<br/>Representative may be present.</p>
<p>7.19 All Evaluation documents shall be as set forth in Exhibit C.</p>
<p>Revised 11/12/13</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>8.1 All reasonable attempts will be made to try to keep individual class sizes close to<br/>the median of the following ranges:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 1,2, and 3</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 4 and 5</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 6,7 and 8<br/>academic classes</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 6, 7, and 8<br/>other classes</p>
<p>24 - 29 students</p>
<p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 29 students</p>
<p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 31 students<br/>25 - 31 students</p>
<p>10-50 students<br/>(depending on the elective)</p>
<p>a. Whenever possible, the district will implement class size reduction</p>
<p>programs funded by state or federal monies. In this case, class size will<br/>conform to the funded program mandates or guidelines.</p>
<p>b. Each class in grades K through 5 with more than 25 students as</p>
<p>determined by the second month enrollment count and/or again after a<br/>second review of enrollment counts on February 1<sup>st</sup> shows a total class<br/>enrollment above 25, will be allocated the equivalent of one hour per day<br/>of Instructional Assistant time in each of the affected classes. Within a<br/>reasonable amount of time to ensure the affected teacher(s) receive the<br/>aide time mentioned above and adhering to and in compliance with the<br/>classified collective bargaining hiring processes, each site will determine<br/>the exact schedule with input by affected teachers and a final decision by<br/>the site principal. The Instructional Assistant shall be NCLB compliant.<br/>Conversely, if the second review on February 1st determines the<br/>enrollment count has decreased to 25 or less, the district will reassign if<br/>possible the Instructional Assistant of the affected class(es) or begin<br/>procedures to reduce Instructional Assistant hours per the Classified<br/>Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>c. In terms of priority, additional support for our teachers (if class size was<br/>exceeded) would be:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offer of aide support and</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of one day per trimester release time for grading and<br/>prepping</p>
<p>8.2 The enrollment for each individual class within Grade level K through 5, shall not<br/>exceed four students above the level established as District average at each K-5<br/>Grade level by the first attendance accounting made in October. (Figures shall<br/>be rounded to the nearest whole number.)</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE (Continued)</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination K-5 classes size limits shall be calculated with the youngest grade<br/>level in the combination. The range limit of K-5 classes in which there are a<br/>combination of grade levels will be set at least two (2) students less than in single<br/>grade level classes. Every attempt will be made to place students in a<br/>combination class who exhibit similar academic rankings based on available<br/>data. These combination classes shall not be used in calculating district-wide<br/>October averages noted in 8.2 above.</p>
<p>.1 The District shall provide one hour of paid instructional assistant time daily<br/>in the classroom based on funding availability.</p>
<p>.2 Site administration will notify parents prior to the start of school regarding<br/>their child’s placement in a combination class.</p>
<p>.3 Site administrators and grade level colleagues will make every attempt to<br/>collaborate to find additional ways to support the combination classroom<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>Music classes and P.E. classes are exempted from the provisions of this<br/>paragraph.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that it becomes necessary to exceed the range described in 8.2<br/>above, the District shall provide one hour of paid instructional assistant time daily<br/>in the classroom where the number of students exceeds the maximum set by<br/>implementing 8.2 above, or other such assistance as agreed upon by the<br/>principal and the teacher.</p>
<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the month of October, the District shall publish the enrollment statistics<br/>district-wide and the statistics shall include the information needed to calculate<br/>the provisions of this article.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructors of classes for the primary purpose of remediation shall be consulted<br/>with concerning the makeup of the class.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDC Class Size</p>
<p>When the student enrollment in the special day class exceeds fourteen (14), the<br/>District will make every effort to make adjustments to the situation during the<br/>current school year and as expeditiously as possible. A review of the student<br/>enrollment will occur involving the special day class teacher, site Principal and<br/>District Coordinator of Special Education Services. The review should include<br/>both student enrollment numbers and an analysis of the severity of student<br/>needs across structured and non-structured environments.</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE (Continued)</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>If the student enrollment cannot be reduced to fourteen (14) or below,</p>
<p>accommodations to the special day class will be explored, agreed upon and</p>
<p>implemented. Accommodations may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional instructional aide time.</p>

<p>Summative Assessment: Temporary, Probationary Teachers</p>
<p>Requirements for first and second year teachers assigned to Instructional Mentors<br/>- For probationary teachers only</p>
<p>Evaluation Process</p>
<p>We believe every student deserves an effective teacher in every classroom. The primary purpose<br/>of our evaluation process is to promote continuous improvement of teacher performance as<br/>indicated by the Dixie District measures of student learning and engagement. An additional<br/>purpose of an effective teacher development and evaluation system is to inform, instruct and<br/>improve teaching and learning; to provide educators with meaningful feedback on areas of<br/>strength and where improvement is needed, and to ensure fair and valid employment decisions.<br/>An effective evaluation system must include both formative and summative methods that must be<br/>integrated with quality professional development and the necessary resources and support for<br/>teachers to improve their practice and enhance student learning.</p>
<p>While the Dixie District assessment system as a whole is designed to support self-directed<br/>professional development, the district has a responsibility to ensure that all children have the<br/>benefit of instruction at a high level of proficiency. Therefore, in accordance with California<br/>Education Code, Section 44664, the District shall follow the Summative Assessment timeline<br/>delineated in the Yearly Evaluation Cycle, Appendix C. The District’s standards of practice are<br/>defined in the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>Evaluation of teaching is a legal responsibility outlined in the California Education Code.<br/>Evaluation is a judgment of performance according to the negotiated District’s standards,<br/>Summative Assessment Report (Form S-9). In the process described in this section, the judgment<br/>is made on the basis of evidence collected and the dialogue that accompanies this evidence. The<br/>Self Assessment and Growth Survey, Continuum of Teaching Practice (Form S-1) should be used<br/>by the teacher at every step in the process to clarify and enrich the discussion and to guide the<br/>judgment of the evidence presented. The Self Assessment and Growth Survey (Form S-1) is to be<br/>used by the teacher for reference and is not to be given to the administrator conducting the<br/>evaluations.</p>
<p>Implementation of an effective evaluation process requires commitment by teachers and<br/>administrators to have open communication, self-reflection and frequent observation and<br/>collaboration.</p>
<p>Steps in the Process</p>
<p>The documents and their results on the Self Assessment and Growth Survey, observations,<br/>communication and lesson planning are some of the elements that will guide the summative<br/>process. The summative process has a number of steps which are described below. The forms<br/>needed to support the process are provided at the end of the narrative description.</p>
<p>During September and October, administrators conduct informal observations of temporary and<br/>probationary teachers. The purpose of these observations is to gather preliminary information<br/>about the teachers' performance styles and strengths. These observations can also help</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>administrators determine if problems exist for which there may be a simple solution and to provide<br/>the new teacher with assistance before a situation has a chance to escalate.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrator reviews job performance expectations with teachers</p>
<p>By September 15, the administrator notifies all Temporary and Probationary teachers that they will<br/>undergo a Summative Evaluation. A fundamental premise of assessment is that teachers should<br/>be evaluated on the performance expectations outlined in the Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession (CSTP) and the California Education Code. This notification can occur with teachers in<br/>a group setting or individually, as determined by the administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher completes Self Assessment and Growth Survey</p>
<p>By September 30, each teacher completes the Self Assessment and Growth Survey (Form S-1).<br/>Staff time during Learning Wednesdays will be given to complete and review the Self Assessment<br/>and Growth Survey (Form S-1) and allow for support team selection. The Self Assessment and<br/>Growth Survey is to be used by the teacher for reference and is not to be given to the<br/>administrator conducting the evaluation. The Self Assessment and Growth Survey serves as the<br/>basis for conversation during the administrator-teacher conference and is used to develop<br/>professional goals and make progress on the continuum.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Summative Conference</p>
<p>By October 15 the teacher and administrator hold an Initial Summative Conference. The teacher<br/>may bring notes, evidence or any pertinent materials to be discussed at this conference.<br/>Administrator may use the Agenda for Initial Summative Conference (Form S-2) to take notes.<br/>During this conference, the teacher should be prepared to discuss:</p>
<p>Self Assessment and Growth Survey (CSTP 1-6)</p>
<p>Following the completion of your Self Assessment and Growth Survey, discuss rating in<br/>each of the standards indicating strengths and areas of improvement.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Students (CSTP 1,4, 5)</p>
<p>State the techniques you use to become knowledgeable about your students.</p>
<p>Describe the students in your class including the cultural composition, special needs,<br/>English language learners and proficiency, and GATE students.</p>
<p>Classroom Management Procedures (CSTP 2)</p>
<p>State your classroom rules, procedures and expectations for student behavior.</p>
<p>Describe what an observer should know about the learning environment which may impact<br/>student learning.</p>
<p>Draft Goals</p>
<p>Based on this conference and discussion with the assessor begin to formulate year long<br/>goals.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal Setting</p>
<p>By October 15 the teacher and administrator hold an Initial Summative Conference. At this<br/>conference the teacher and administrator agree upon three annual professional goals with one<br/>being directly related to the district’s Board of Education goals as they pertain to student learning.<br/>The goals will be aligned with the CSTP’s and measured by student growth and outcomes. A<br/>written draft of these goals are completed by the teacher prior to the Initial Summative Conference<br/>and agreed upon and/or revised by the teacher and administrator during this conference due by<br/>November 1. This will happen on the Goal Setting for Summative Conference (Form S-3).</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Summative Support Team and Administrative approval</p>
<p>The teacher will select a Summative Support Team and submit it to the administrator by<br/>November 1. If an individual is working on an ongoing project, s/he may work alone with the<br/>approval of the administrator/designee. Summative Support Teams have no size or composition<br/>restrictions; however, a heterogeneous mix of experience levels, background, grade levels and<br/>subjects for each team is optimal. Teams should strive for members that will challenge and probe<br/>thinking to enhance professional growth while functioning at an optimal level of cooperation and<br/>productivity. A copy of this Summative Support Team (Form S-4) is signed and submitted to the<br/>Administrator by November 1 for approval.</p>
<p>Teacher meets with support team</p>
<p>Teachers who are working in a support team in the Summative Assessment process are expected<br/>to meet with their support teams during. Time will be provided during Learning Wednesdays.<br/>These teams work as collegial friends and the purpose is to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarify their understanding of the standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help prepare for the summative conferences held throughout the year by using the<br/>conference agendas as guides</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help reflect on the quality of the evidence collected for all standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist team members as needed in the gathering of evidence</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborate with colleagues to achieve their goals</p>
<p>Working together so all members grow professionally during the summative year may be the most<br/>important task of the Summative Support Teams. A review of evidence can lead to rich dialogue<br/>among members about the cycle of teaching and learning, and the meaning and challenge of<br/>engaging students.</p>
<p>5. Administrator completes formal observations</p>
<p>The administrator completes a minimum of two formal classroom observations and one<br/>unscheduled observation with each teacher in the Summative Assessment process. The first<br/>formal observation must be completed by December 1. At that time the administrator will complete<br/>the Mid-Year Summative Evaluation Report Temporary, Probationary Teachers (Form S-8). The<br/>second formal observation must be completed by February 1. At that time the administrator will<br/>complete the Summative Assessment Report (Form S-9).</p>
<p>A formal observation consists of a pre-observation conference that includes a written lesson plan,<br/>a classroom observation, and a post-observation conference. The Agenda for Summative<br/>Assessment: Pre-Observation Conference (Form S-5) and the Teacher Post-Observation Lesson<br/>Plan Reflection (Form S-6) provide the discussion guides for these conferences. Teachers<br/>prepare for the observations by reviewing the conference agendas. Both scheduled and<br/>unscheduled observations may be part of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Pre-Observation Conference</p>
<p>Teachers are expected to provide a copy of their lesson plan for the observed lesson A sample<br/>lesson plan is in Appendix A. During the conference, it is the teacher’s responsibility to talk<br/>through the lesson plan and its context within the instructional unit using the discussion points on<br/>the Agenda for Summative Assessment: Pre-Observation Conference (Form S-5).</p>
<p>Also during this conference, teachers may wish to revise the information on classroom<br/>management or knowledge of students presented during the Initial Summative Conference (Form<br/>S-2) if the information has been revised or refined in a way that would have bearing on this<br/>planning-observation cycle. The lesson plan presented and the resulting discussion provides<br/>evidence of the teacher's skill in planning (Standard 4).</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Formal Observation</p>
<p>The administrator is responsible for collecting additional &quot;evidence&quot; of the teacher's skill in<br/>teaching, including both planning and implementation of instruction. Observation notes can be<br/>recorded in a variety of ways: on seating charts and floor plans, etc. if the lesson is primarily<br/>discussion or if much movement from place to place is involved; in a timeline format; in script tape<br/>format. The observation notes, once recorded, become the evidence of the teacher's skill in<br/>teaching and facilitating (Standards 1-5) and will be used for reference during the Post-<br/>Observation Conference. The Observation Notes form, which may be used by administrator to<br/>collect evidence, is in Appendix B.</p>
<p>Teacher and Administrator Post-Observation Lesson Plan Reflection (Form S-6 and<br/>Form S-7) and Mid-Year Summative Evaluation Report Temporary, Probationary<br/>Teachers (Form S-8).</p>
<p>These forms are used to reflect on the lesson and record progress toward goals. They will be<br/>shared during the Post-Observation Conference by December 1. The post observation<br/>conference will follow an observation. The teacher and administrator will use the Teacher Post-<br/>Observation Lesson Plan Reflection (Form S-6) and Administrator Post-Observation Lesson Plan<br/>Reflection (Form S-7) during this conference.</p>
<p>By December 1, the administrator will complete the Mid-Year Summative Evaluation Report<br/>Temporary, Probationary Teachers (Form S-8).</p>
<p>Any certificated employee will be granted a subsequent observation at their request.</p>
<p>Any certificated employee who is informed of concerns noted on the Administrator Post-<br/>Observation Lesson Plan Reflection (Form S-7) shall, upon request of the Administrator, be<br/>entitled to one (1) subsequent observation.</p>
<p>NOTE: The intention is for the observation cycle to be completed on a single instructional period.<br/>That is, the instructional episode that is discussed during the pre-observation conference is also<br/>the one observed and reflected upon in the post-observation conference. In some instances, an<br/>emergency may arise causing the actual classroom observation to be canceled. If this occurs, it is<br/>not necessary to hold another pre-observation conference on the newly scheduled instructional<br/>episode. The teacher is not obligated to prepare a new formal lesson plan but should provide<br/>instructional goals. The observation of the instruction can take place and the post-observation<br/>conference held on the rescheduled instructional episode. <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>6. Teacher prepares for Final Summative Conference</p>
<p>This Final Summative Conference in its entirety provides the administrator and teacher with an<br/>invaluable “window” on classroom practice and enables the teacher to articulate his or her work in<br/>a highly professional manner.</p>
<p>The teacher prepares for the Final Summative Conference:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review and reassess the teachers practice on the Self Assessment and Growth Survey<br/>(Form S-1) and be prepared to discuss their growth</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflect and finalize their three annual professional goals using Goal Setting for Summative<br/>Conference (Form S-3)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather any evidence to highlight practice or evidence requested by administrator</p>
<p>o Ensure all forms have been completed by the teacher and/or administrator<br/>(Appendix F)</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>o Be prepared to discuss examples of school and community contributions<br/>(Appendix G)</p>
<p>o Be prepared to discuss examples of professional development (Appendix H)</p>
<p>7. Teacher and administrator hold the Final Summative Conference</p>
<p>The Final Summative Conference is held by February 15 and may be used as a launching point<br/>for the teacher’s next formative year. This conference is an opportunity for the teacher's skill to be<br/>displayed as a coherent body of work, and to be recognized as such.</p>
<p>Part 1: Professional Growth</p>
<p>The administrator and teacher discuss the teacher’s growth on the Self Assessment and<br/>Growth Survey (Form S-1), as well as any questions the administrator or teacher may<br/>have. As the final activity of the process, teachers review the evidence they have collected<br/>and the professional growth activities in which they participated throughout the year. They<br/>reflect on their growth goals and how the evidence of their activities contributes to the<br/>progress towards the goals.</p>
<p>Part 2: Evaluation</p>
<p>The administrator provides a draft of the Summative Assessment Report (Form S-9) for<br/>discussion of growth and performance in each of the six California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession. This conference enables the teacher to point out important aspects<br/>of his/her work. The administrator will use this discussion to add notes to the Summative<br/>Assessment Report (Form S-9) before a final copy is presented to the teacher.</p>
<p>8. Administrator completes summative assessment</p>
<p>By March 1, the administrator completes the evaluation process by completing the Summative<br/>Assessment Report (Form S-9). The narrative should reflect the quality of performance based on<br/>the evidence collected by both teacher and administrator. In the Summative Assessment, the<br/>teacher is evaluated on all six standards from the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession.</p>
<p>The teacher signs the Summative Assessment Report form; copies are filed with the teacher,<br/>administrator, and Personnel Department. Evidence is not submitted with the report to Personnel.</p>

<p>1. Administrator reviews job performance expectations with teachers</p>
<p>A fundamental premise of assessment is that teachers should be evaluated on the performance<br/>expectations outlined in the Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and the California<br/>Education Code. The personnel office will notify each principal regarding the teachers who are<br/>to be included in the Summative Assessment process by September 1. The administrator<br/>notifies any teachers who are to undergo a summative evaluation, by September 15. This</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>notification can occur with teachers in a group setting or individually, as determined by the<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher completes Self Assessment and Growth Survey.</p>
<p>Each teacher completes the Self Assessment and Growth Survey (Form S-1) by September 30.<br/>Staff time during Learning Wednesdays will be given to complete and review the Self<br/>Assessment and Growth Survey (Form S-1) and allow for support team selection (optional). The<br/>Self Assessment and Growth Survey is to be used by the teacher for reference and is not to be<br/>given to the administrator conducting the evaluation. The Self Assessment and Growth Survey<br/>serves as the basis for conversation during the administrator-teacher conference and is used to<br/>develop professional goals and make progress on the continuum.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Summative Conference</p>
<p>By October 15 the teacher and administrator hold an Initial Summative Conference. The teacher<br/>may bring notes, evidence or any pertinent materials to be discussed at this conference.<br/>Administrator may use the Agenda for Initial Summative Conference (Form S-2) to take notes.<br/>During this conference, the teacher should be prepared to discuss:</p>
<p>Self Assessment and Growth Survey (CSTP 1-6)</p>
<p>Following the completion of your Self Assessment and Growth Survey, discuss rating in<br/>each of the standards indicating strengths and areas of improvement.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Students (CSTP 1.4.5)</p>
<p>State the techniques you use to become knowledgeable about your students.</p>
<p>Describe the students in your class including the cultural composition, special needs,<br/>English language learners and proficiency, and GATE students.</p>
<p>Classroom Management Procedures (CSTP 2)</p>
<p>State your classroom rules, procedures and expectations for student behavior.</p>
<p>Describe what an observer should know about the learning environment which may<br/>impact student learning.</p>
<p>Draft Goals</p>
<p>Based on this conference and discussion with the assessor begin to formulate year long<br/>goals.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal Setting</p>
<p>The teacher and administrator agree upon three annual professional goals with one being<br/>directly related to the district’s Board of Education goals as they pertain to student learning. The<br/>goals will be aligned with the CSTP's and measured by student growth and outcomes. A written<br/>draft of these goals is completed by the teacher prior to the Initial Summative Conference and<br/>agreed upon and/or revised by the teacher and administrator during this conference and due by<br/>November 1. This will happen on the Goal Setting for Summative Conference (Form S-3).</p>
<p>Summative Support Team (optional)</p>
<p>The teacher is encouraged to select a Summative Support Team (Form S-4) and submit it to the<br/>administrator by November 1. Summative Support Teams have no size or composition<br/>restrictions; however, a heterogeneous mix of experience levels, background, grade levels and<br/>subjects for each team is optimal. Teams should strive for members that will challenge and<br/>probe thinking to enhance professional growth while functioning at an optimal level of<br/>cooperation and productivity.</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Teachers who are working in a support team in the Summative Assessment process should<br/>meet with their support teams as part of the Learning Wednesdays. These teams work as<br/>collegial friends and the purpose is to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarify their understanding of the standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help prepare for the summative conferences held throughout the year by using the<br/>conference agendas as guides</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help reflect on the quality of the evidence collected for all standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist team members as needed in the gathering of evidence</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborate with colleagues to achieve their goals</p>
<p>Collaboration with a team can lead to rich dialogue among members about the cycle of teaching<br/>and learning, and the meaning and challenge of engaging students. If an individual is working<br/>on an ongoing project, s/he may work alone with the approval of the administrator/designee.</p>
<p>5. Administrator completes formal observations)</p>
<p>The administrator completes a minimum of one formal classroom observation and one<br/>unscheduled observation (November-March) with each teacher in the Summative Assessment<br/>process. The formal observation (including pre/post conferences) must be completed by<br/>March 1.</p>
<p>A formal observation consists of a pre-observation conference that includes a written lesson<br/>plan, a classroom observation, and a post-observation conference. The Agenda for Summative<br/>Assessment: Pre-Observation Conference (Form S-5) and the Teacher Post-Observation<br/>Lesson Plan Reflection (Form S-6) and the Administrator Post-Observation Lesson Plan<br/>Reflection (Form S-7) provide the discussion guides for these conferences. Teachers prepare<br/>for the observations by reviewing the conference agendas. Both scheduled and unscheduled<br/>observations may be part of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Pre-Observation Conference</p>
<p>Teachers are expected to provide a copy of their lesson plan for the observed lesson. A sample<br/>lesson plan is in Appendix A. During the conference, it is the teacher's responsibility to talk<br/>through the lesson plan and its context within the instructional unit using the discussion points<br/>on the Agenda for Summative Assessment: Pre-Observation Conference (Form S-5).</p>
<p>Also during this conference, teachers may wish to revise the information on classroom<br/>management or knowledge of students presented during the Initial Summative Conference<br/>(Form S-2) if the information has been revised or refined in a way that would have bearing on<br/>this planning-observation cycle. The lesson plan presented and the resulting discussion<br/>provides evidence of the teacher's skill in planning (CSTP 4).</p>
<p>Formal Observation</p>
<p>The administrator is responsible for collecting additional &quot;evidence&quot; of the teacher's skill in<br/>teaching, including both planning and implementation of instruction. Observation notes can be<br/>recorded in a variety of ways: on seating charts and floor plans, etc. if the lesson is primarily<br/>discussion or if much movement from place to place is involved; in a timeline format; in script<br/>tape format. The observation notes, once recorded, become the evidence of the teacher's skill<br/>in teaching and facilitating (CSTP 1-5) and will be used for reference during the Post-<br/>Observation Conference. The Administrator Observation form, which may be used by<br/>administrator to collect evidence, is in Appendix B.</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Teacher and Administrator Post-Observation Lesson Plan Reflection (Form S-6<br/>and Form S-7)</p>
<p>This is used by the teacher to reflect on the lesson and is submitted during the Post-<br/>Observation Conference. The post observation conference will follow an observation. The<br/>teacher and administrator will use the Teacher Post-Observation Lesson Plan Reflection (Form<br/>S-6) and Administrator Post-Observation Lesson Plan Reflection (Form S-7) during this<br/>conference.</p>
<p>Any certificated employee will be granted a subsequent observation at their request.</p>
<p>Any certificated employee who is informed of concerns noted on the Administrator Post-<br/>Observation Lesson Plan Reflection (Form S-7) shall, upon request of the Administrator, be<br/>entitled to one (1) subsequent observation.</p>
<p>If there are any concerns, the teacher may be placed in the Assistance Plan for Permanent Unit<br/>Members for support prior to the second observation.</p>
<p>If a teacher is in Assistance Plan for Permanent Unit Member and the administrator deems it<br/>necessary, they will recommend the Professional Support Phase or the Corrective Phase (see<br/>Assistance Plan for Permanent Unit Members) in writing by March 1. A copy of this<br/>recommendation is forwarded to the Personnel Department.</p>
<p>NOTE: The intention is for the observation cycle to be completed on a single instructional<br/>period. That is, the instructional episode that is discussed during the pre-observation conference<br/>is also the one observed and reflected upon in the post-observation conference. In some<br/>instances, an emergency may arise causing the actual classroom observation to be canceled. If<br/>this occurs, it is not necessary to hold another pre-observation conference on the newly-<br/>scheduled instructional episode. The teacher is not obligated to prepare a new formal lesson<br/>plan but should provide instructional goals. The observation of the instruction can take place<br/>and the post-observation conference held on the rescheduled instructional episode.</p>
<p>6. Teacher prepares for Final Summative Conference</p>
<p>This Final Summative Conference in its entirety provides the administrator and teacher with an<br/>invaluable “window” on classroom practice and enables the teacher to articulate his or her work<br/>in a highly professional manner.</p>
<p>The teacher prepares for the Final Summative Conference:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review and reassess the teacher’s practice on the Self Assessment and Growth Survey<br/>(Form S-1) and be prepared to discuss their growth</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflect upon and review his/her three annual professional goals using Goal Setting for<br/>Summative Conference (Form S-3)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather any evidence to highlight practice or evidence requested by administrator</p>
<p>o Ensure all forms have been completed by the teacher and/or administrator<br/>(Appendix F)</p>
<p>o Be prepared to discuss examples of school and community contributions<br/>(Appendix G)</p>
<p>o Be prepared to discuss examples of professional development (Appendix H)</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher and administrator hold the Final Summative Conference</p>
<p>The Final Summative Conference is held by April 15 and may be used as a launching point for<br/>the teacher’s next formative year. This conference is an opportunity for the teacher's skill to be<br/>displayed as a coherent body of work, and to be recognized as such.</p>
<p>Part 1: Professional Growth</p>
<p>The administrator and teacher discuss the teacher’s growth on the Self Assessment and<br/>Growth Survey (Form S-1), as well as any questions the administrator or teacher may<br/>have. As the final activity of the process, teachers review the evidence they have<br/>collected and the professional growth activities in which they participated throughout the<br/>year. They reflect on their growth goals and how the evidence of their activities<br/>contributes to the progress towards the goals.</p>
<p>Part 2: Evaluation</p>
<p>The administrator provides a draft of the Summative Assessment Report (Form S-9) for<br/>discussion of growth and performance in each of the six California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession. This conference enables the teacher to point out important aspects<br/>of his/her work. The administrator will use this discussion to add notes to the Summative<br/>Assessment Report (Form S-9) before a final copy is presented to the teacher.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrator completes summative assessment</p>
<p>By April 30, the administrator completes the evaluation process by completing the Summative<br/>Assessment Report (Form S-9). The narrative should reflect the quality of performance based<br/>on the evidence collected by both teacher and administrator. In the Summative Assessment, the<br/>teacher is evaluated on all six standards from the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession.</p>
<p>The teacher signs the Summative Assessment Report form; copies are filed with the teacher,<br/>administrator, and Personnel Department. Evidence is not submitted with the report to<br/>Personnel.</p>

<p>Formative Assessment</p>
<p>The formative process is teacher directed and will produce evidence of steps taken to achieve<br/>the goal. Those continuing contract teachers not involved in summative assessment participate<br/>in formative assessment each year. This process is self-directed, collegial and results based. In<br/>the formative process, the teacher conducts a self assessment and selects, with the approval of<br/>an administrator, two suitable goals for professional growth. The teacher then establishes a<br/>support team and develops a plan to achieve his/her goals. If an individual is working on an<br/>ongoing project they may work alone with the approval of an administrator.</p>
<p>Examples of evidence to guide teacher's reflection may be: planning documents, samples of<br/>student work, record of participating in professional events. This evidence can be part of a<br/>portfolio that can guide the summative assessment.</p>
<p>1. Self Assessment Process</p>
<p>All teachers complete a Self Assessment and Growth Survey (Form F-1) by November 1 and<br/>use it as evidence when creating a growth plan. This process is designed to encourage<br/>teachers to thoughtfully consider every component in each standard and to accurately<br/>determine the specific level of his or her performance.</p>
<p>The teacher analyzes the self assessment for evidence of patterns of strength and areas of<br/>growth and determines an area of practice for focused attention and improvement during the<br/>coming school year. This area for focus is used to formulate two growth goals and may consist<br/>of a single aspect of teaching (such as the use of technology), or it may span a number of the<br/>individual areas (for example, understanding the cultures of one's students and improving<br/>questioning and discussion techniques.) But in all cases, each teacher’s goals and the resulting<br/>plan developed from the goals should be consistent with the California Standards for the<br/>Teacher Profession (CSTP), as well as the district’s Board of Education goals as they pertain to<br/>student learning. Staff time during Learning Wednesdays will be given to complete and review<br/>the Self Assessment and Growth Survey (Form F-1) and the Professional Growth Plan (Form F-<br/>2) allow for support team selection.</p>
<p>Formative Support Team Selection</p>
<p>The teacher will select a support team. If an individual is working on an ongoing project, s/he<br/>may work alone with the approval of the administrator/designee. Teams should strive for<br/>members that will challenge and probe thinking to enhance professional growth while<br/>functioning at an optimal level of cooperation and productivity. A team may consist of two<br/>individuals or many individuals.</p>
<p>Examples of Support Teams:</p>
<p>Coach-Advisee: One person is an &quot;expert” in an area, willing to coach others while they begin<br/>or continue their learning.</p>
<p>Collegial Friends: No defined leader and teachers can have different growth goals. This group<br/>is composed of teachers with an established collaborative working relationship willing to support<br/>each other in learning even if their goals are in different areas. Examples include grade level<br/>teams or a middle school department.</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/14</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>School-District/County Cohort: Members of this team may come from throughout the district<br/>and even from other districts to focus on a common area of interest and growth. Examples<br/>include teachers from different schools with shared interests or district/county committees.</p>
<p>Teams should be established and added to the Professional Growth Plan (Form F-2) by<br/>November 1. This provides maximum time for teachers to work in their teams. Some of the<br/>topics or conversations could be to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarify their understanding of the standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help each other reflect on the quality of the evidence collected for all standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist team members as needed in the gathering of evidence</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborate with colleagues to achieve their goals</p>
<p>A copy of the plan will be submitted to the Administrator by November 1.</p>
<p>After reviewing the goals and plan, the administrator/designee may choose to conference with a<br/>teacher. While the growth goal should represent consensus between the teacher and the<br/>administrator/designee, in those rare cases where there is significant disagreement as to<br/>appropriate areas for focus, the recommendations of the administrator will prevail.</p>
<p>2. Teacher Implements Professional Growth Plan</p>
<p>The activities written into the growth plan are the means to fostering movement toward the goal.<br/>Examples of activities to support growth goals:</p>
<p>. Observe and discuss with teachers known to be skilled in the area identified for focus<br/>. Attend workshops, take courses</p>
<p>. Read books and articles, watch videos of practice, discuss with members of the team or<br/>study group<br/>. Prepare a keynote presentation</p>
<p>. Collect and analyze student work from one's own teaching<br/>. Interview members of the community and attend community events<br/>. Create and analyze a video of one’s own classroom<br/>• Analyze test results to determine areas of need of one’s students<br/>. Take photos of work, bulletin boards, projects</p>
<p>The list of possible activities to support a growth goal is virtually endless. The critical<br/>consideration is how a certain activity enables a professional educator to achieve his/her goal.<br/>When implementing a growth plan, teachers should consider the resources they may need, as<br/>well as the documentation that will result from the activities. For example, if a teacher wants to<br/>observe another teacher, a substitute teacher may be needed (resource) and observation notes<br/>and a summary of what was derived from the visit (documentation) will be written.</p>
<p>During the year teachers:</p>
<p>□ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend meetings with their support team</p>
<p>□ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect evidence of activities that they may choose to use as part of their next<br/>Summative Assessment</p>
<p>□ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete a Formative Assessment Meeting Log/Notes to Support Final Reflection<br/>(Form F-3)</p>
<p>□ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrators can request to view this log as needed to verify progress</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/1 I</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>There may be instances where support teams are not functioning and are not meeting the<br/>needs of the team members. If teachers find that this is the case with their team, it is the<br/>teachers’ responsibility to solicit assistance from the administrator/designee in remedying the<br/>situation.</p>
<p>3. Teacher Reflects on Progress Toward Goals</p>
<p>As a final activity of the Formative process, the teacher will review the evidence they have<br/>collected and the professional growth activities that they have participated in throughout the<br/>year (Form F-3). Teachers will reflect on their growth goals and how the evidence of these<br/>activities contributed to their progress toward their goals. Formative Assessment Professional<br/>Growth Plan Reflection (Form F-4) will be submitted to the Administrator by May 1.</p>

<p>Summative Assessment Report Rating Criteria</p>
<p>The administrator completes the evaluation process by writing the Summative Assessment<br/>Report (Form S-9). The narrative should reflect the quality of performance based on the<br/>evidence collected by both teacher and administrator and discussion(s) about these artifacts. In<br/>the Summative Assessment, the teacher is evaluated on all six standards from the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>The District Standards rating scale for each standard is:</p>
<p>Does meet<br/>Does not meet</p>
<p>Final rating:</p>
<p>Does meet the Dixie School District Standards for the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession</p>
<p>Does not meet Dixie School District Standards for the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession</p>
<p>Here are the criteria for continued employment for all teachers:</p>
<p>Does meet: Using the Summative Assessment Report (S-9) a teacher who obtains ratings of<br/>“Does meet” in at least five of the six standards will receive “Does meet the Dixie School District<br/>Standards for the California Standards for the Teaching Profession” as a final rating.</p>
<p>Does not meet: Using the Summative Assessment Report (S-9) a teacher who obtains ratings<br/>of “Does not meet” in two or more of the six standards will receive “Does not meet Dixie School<br/>District Standards for the California Standards for the Teaching Profession” as a final rating.</p>

<p>Assistance for Permanent Unit Members</p>
<p>Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the right of the Superintendent to recommend to the<br/>School Board the non-renewal or termination of any unit member.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of Assistance for Permanent Unit Members is to provide a supported, structured,<br/>and focused system of assistance to ensure that every unit member is meeting the District<br/>Standards which include for teachers the California Standards for the Teaching Profession<br/>(CSTP).</p>
<p>The Assistance Plan consists of:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness Phase</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Support Phase</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corrective Phase</p>
<p>This Professional Assistance Plan runs concurrently with a teacher’s Formative/Summative<br/>Evaluation cycle. At their discretion, parties may include representation during meetings.</p>
<p>Awareness Phase</p>
<p>The purpose of the Awareness Phase is to bring individuals together to identify and discuss<br/>areas of concern related to District Standards. In the Awareness Phase the administrator or unit<br/>member identifies a concern in writing using the Assistance Plan for Permanent Unit Members<br/>Awareness Phase Planning Form (Form AP-1). The administrator and unit member meet to<br/>collaborate and attempt to solve the concern.</p>
<p>The Awareness Phase will be discussed at an initial meeting held within ten working days of<br/>written notification by either party. The Awareness Phase should reach completion within the<br/>mutually agreed upon established time frame on the Assistance Plan for Permanent Unit<br/>Members Awareness Phase Planning Form (Form AP-1).</p>
<p>The Awareness Plan will include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement identifying the concern relative to a professional teaching standard</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of individuals involved in the plan</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing of action plan strategies and success indicators, including</p>
<p>resources to be allocated for plan implementation and completion<br/>staff development<br/>peer coaching</p>
<p>a timeline indicating implementation dates<br/>meeting dates to review progress of the plan<br/>final review dates</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this phase, the administrator reviews progress and makes one of the<br/>following recommendations:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concern resolved; no further action necessary and the teacher remains in the<br/>Formative/Summative process</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress noted; continuation of procedures and timeline in the Formative/Summative<br/>process</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns remain unresolved; movement to the Professional Support Phase</p>
<p>Rev. 8/15/2014</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>Meeting minutes and discussions within the Awareness Phase will remain at the site level<br/>between concerned parties. Written documentation of the Awareness Phase will remain at the<br/>site level.</p>
<p>Professional Support Phase</p>
<p>The purpose of the Professional Support Phase is to provide more specific guidance and<br/>assistance for the resolution of concerns identified in the Awareness Phase of the Assistance<br/>Plan for Permanent Unit Members and/or from a Does not meet the Dixie School District<br/>Standards for the California Standards for Teaching Profession on the Summative Assessment<br/>Report. The Professional Support Phase will be discussed at an initial meeting to be held within<br/>ten working days of the final meeting of the Awareness Phase. During this phase, teachers will<br/>remain in the summative evaluation cycle and intensive supervisory assistance procedures will<br/>be implemented. Whenever possible, procedures and timelines will be established<br/>collaboratively. These procedures will be referred to as the Assistance Plan for Permanent Unit<br/>Members Professional Support Phase Action Plan (Form AP-2).</p>
<p>The Professional Support Action Plan will include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement identifying the concern relative to a professional teaching standard</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of individuals involved in the plan</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing of action plan strategies and success indicators, including</p>
<p>resources to be allocated for plan implementation and completion<br/>staff development<br/>peer coaching</p>
<p>a timeline indicating implementation dates<br/>meeting dates to review progress of the plan<br/>final review dates</p>
<p>The Professional Support Phase Action Plan (Form AP-2) will be filed at the site and district<br/>levels. At their discretion, parties may include representation during meetings. A written review<br/>of progress at the conclusion of the designated time period will result in one of the three<br/>recommendations:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concern resolved; removal from Professional Support Phase and the teacher remains in<br/>the Formative/Summative process.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress noted; continuation of Professional Support Phase</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns unresolved; movement to Corrective Phase (PAR)</p>
<p>Corrective Phase</p>
<p>The teacher may be placed in the Corrective Phase because of, but not limited to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not meeting the Dixie School District Standards for Teacher Performance which may<br/>include the California Standards for the Teaching Profession after being in the<br/>Professional Support Phase (see Appendix C)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insubordination</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific policy or rule violation(s)</p>
<p>The Corrective Phase begins with a meeting between the administrator, teacher, and DTA<br/>president or designated representative. Other resource people may be involved. The<br/>administrator will identify in writing the specific standard(s), rule or policy in violation. The<br/>teacher will be given an opportunity to respond. Following the discussion, the administrator will<br/>indicate the next steps to be taken, such as:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific remedial plan with timeline</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement of the teacher on paid administrative leave</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirement of specific training or evaluation by a professional</p>

<p>Policy 4161.8/4261.8</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>APPENDIX B</p>
<p>FAMILY CARE AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY</p>
<p>Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the California Family Rights Act<br/>(collectively, &quot;the Acts&quot;), eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 work-weeks of unpaid, job-<br/>protected leave within a 12 month period for family and medical reasons. The Dixie School<br/>District (&quot;District&quot;) intends to comply with the Acts and their pertinent regulations, and the<br/>interpretation of this policy is governed by the Acts.</p>
<p>The following conditions, requirements, and procedures shall apply when requests for family<br/>care of medical leave are made:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Eligibility. To be eligible for benefits under the Acts, an employee must:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have worked for the District for at least 12 months;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have worked at least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months for the District or<br/>are classified as full time employees of the District; and</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be one of at least 50 employees employed by the District within 75 miles of the<br/>employee's work site.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons for Taking Leave. A leave request from an eligible employee must be granted<br/>for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birth of the employee's child;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care for the employee's child, spouse, parent, or domestic partner;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee's own serious health condition that keeps the employee from<br/>performing his or her job functions.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance Notice of Leave and Medical Certification. Employees will provide</p>
<p>(1) advance written notice of the leave request, (2) medical certification whenever a<br/>serious health condition is involved and (3) a completed District Employee Request for<br/>Family Care and Medical Leave.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the need for the leave is foreseeable, employees will provide 30 days advance<br/>written notice. The advance notice should include the Employee Request for<br/>Family Care and Medical Leave form. If the need for the leave is unforeseen<br/>(i.e., an emergency), notice is required to be given as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave is to care for a family member with a serious health condition, or<br/>because of the employee's own serious health condition, the employee will<br/>provide medical certification from a health care provider or physician. The<br/>medical certification must include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date of commencement of the serious health condition;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probable duration of the condition;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated amount of time the health care provider will provide care;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmation that the serious condition of the child, spouse or parent<br/>warrants the participation of the employee; or, in the case of the<br/>employee's own serious health condition, certification that the employee<br/>is unable to perform his or her job functions.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a second and third medical opinion regarding an<br/>employee's serious health condition, at the District's expense. When the duration<br/>of the leave is uncertain or the estimated time for the leave expires and the<br/>employee remains out of work, the District may require subsequent<br/>recertification.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave is needed for planned medical treatment or supervision, the<br/>employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment or<br/>supervision to minimize disruptions to the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee's advance notice and medical certification and Employee Request<br/>for Family Care and Medical Leave may be required to be given to the<br/>employee's supervisor (or other designated individual). The supervisor (or other<br/>designated individual) may then determine the adequacy of the notice and<br/>medical certification.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to provide advance notice, satisfactory medical certification and<br/>Employee Request for Family Care and Medical Leave when necessary may<br/>delay the granting of leave until such requirements are met. In the event that<br/>the delay in giving notice to the District prevents the District from securing<br/>an acceptable substitute, the District may require that the leave commence<br/>at a later time. This does not apply to unforeseeable emergencies.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation of Health Coverage and Other Job Benefit Plans.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee taking leave will continue to participate in any group health care<br/>benefits plan under the same terms and conditions, including any necessary co¬<br/>payments, by which the employee was enrolled prior to the first day of the leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee fails to return from the leave for any reason other than the<br/>recurrence, continuance, or onset of a serious health condition, the employee will<br/>be liable to the District for premiums paid for maintaining the employee's health<br/>coverage.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may, at his or her expense, continue to participate in all other<br/>employee benefit plans offered by the employer during the leave period.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave. An employee may take leave intermittently</p>
<p>(e.g., in blocks of time), or by reducing a normal work schedule, in the following</p>
<p>circumstances:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the leave is for the birth or placement of a child, leave may be taken on an<br/>intermittent or reduced schedule basis if the District approves.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule whenever it is<br/>medically necessary to care for a family member with a serious health condition,<br/>or because the employee is seriously ill and unable to work the employee's<br/>regular work schedule.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitution of Paid Leave and Other Leave Requests.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may use paid sick or vacation leave and family care leave<br/>concurrently if the reason for the paid leave meets the requirements of the family<br/>care leave (Section B).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any paid or unpaid leave taken which meets the requirements of Section B of this<br/>policy will be counted as part of the employee's family care leave entitlement.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity. Women on maternity leave will not start using family care leave until their<br/>disability period is over (i.e., when their physician takes them off disability after the birth<br/>of their child).</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouses Who Work for the District. Spouses employed by the District are jointly entitled<br/>to a combined total of 12 work weeks of family leave for the birth or placement of a child<br/>with them. Each spouse is entitled to 12 weeks for leaves taken for the serious health<br/>condition of their child.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Period of Eligibility. The 12-month period of entitlement commences on the first day of<br/>the leave.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority. Employee Benefits and Break in Service. An employee on leave will not lose any<br/>seniority or employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave. An employee on<br/>leave will not accrue STRS credit or additional benefits, such as vacation, sick leave or<br/>similar benefits, during the leave. The leave will not constitute a break in service for<br/>purposes of longevity and seniority. (See Article 3.4 of the DTA Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement for Step Advancement requirements.)</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoration of Employment and Fitness for Duty Report. Employees returning from an<br/>approved leave will be reinstated to the same or equivalent position. Employees<br/>returning from an approved medical leave for their own serious health condition may be<br/>required to provide a fitness for duty report to return to work.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kev Employee Exception to Restoration. An employee who is a &quot;key&quot; employee due to<br/>the fact that he or she is a salaried employee and among the highest paid 10 percent of<br/>all employees employed by the District may be denied restoration to his or her position<br/>following the leave if the District determines that substantial and grievous economic<br/>injury will result if such key employee is reinstated.</p>

Based<br/>on the needs of the teacher, the PAR Panel shall determine the nature of<br/>assistance which the Support Provider shall provide.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation of the Assistance Plan:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible after assignment, the Support Provider shall review<br/>the referring packet for the Referred or Volunteer Teacher. Thereafter,<br/>the Support Provider shall meet with the Referred or Volunteer Teacher<br/>and the site principal together or separately, as appropriate, to review<br/>the employee’s performance and recommendations for improvement.<br/>The Support Provider will then prepare a written Assistance Plan aimed<br/>at remedying the deficiencies which were cited in the Referred<br/>Teacher’s unsatisfactory evaluation or meeting the goals set forth in the<br/>Volunteer Teacher’s application. For the Referred Teacher, it will<br/>include: performance goals which are aligned with pupil learning and<br/>consistent with Stull Bill criteria and CSTP, and a projected date for<br/>completion which will ordinarily be May 1. The plan will be submitted to<br/>the PAR Panel for final development and approval.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistance Plan will include multiple observations of the<br/>Referred or Volunteer Teacher by the Support Provider and both<br/>pre observation and post observation conferences will be held.</p>
<p>These observations will be in addition to any that are performed as<br/>part of the evaluation Article in this agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Support Provider will prepare and discuss with the PAR Panel<br/>periodic reports of the Referred or Volunteer Teacher’s participation<br/>in the program and progress. The Support Provider’s report shall<br/>include an assessment as to whether the Assistance Plan can be<br/>discontinued, whether the plan needs revision, or whether the plan<br/>needs to be extended beyond its original projected term. For<br/>purposes of the Volunteer Teacher, these reports shall be limited to<br/>an assistance log.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 1, or at a later date if specified in the Assistance Plan, the<br/>Support Provider shall make a final report to the Referred or<br/>Volunteer Teacher, and for Referred Teacher’s, to the PAR Panel<br/>and the evaluator. The Final Report shall not constitute the<br/>District’s evaluation of the employee’s performance but, in the case<br/>of a Referred Teacher, shall (and, in the case of a Volunteer<br/>Teacher, may at his or her request) be considered by the site<br/>administrator in preparing any evaluation document or proposing<br/>any personnel action.</p>
<p>C. Referred Teachers shall be provided:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple PAR Support Provider observations during classroom<br/>instruction including both pre and post observation conferences.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable training and other support as needed to assist<br/>improvement in teaching skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Support Provider (SP) who is assigned by the PAR Panel. If a<br/>pool of SPs exists, the PAR Panel shall provide participating<br/>permanent teachers, voluntary or referred, with a list of available<br/>SPs. The permanent teacher may indicate the SP that he/she<br/>prefers, but the PAR Panel shall not be bound by the preference.<br/>The PAR Panel shall notify the permanent teacher, his/her<br/>principals, and the SP in writing that the permanent teacher is<br/>participating in PAR and of the SP who has been appointed.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance goals for participating teachers in writing, clearly<br/>stated, aligned with subject matter knowledge and/or instructional<br/>techniques or strategies and consistent with Education Code<br/>section 44662 (Stull Bill provision) and CSTP. The goals will be<br/>submitted to the PAR Panel for final development and approval.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to submit a written response within 20 days and have it<br/>attached to any report by the Support Provider and/or PAR Panel.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to request a meeting with the PAR Panel with the right to<br/>have representation.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the final report shall be included in the Referred<br/>Teacher’s personnel file after he or she has had an opportunity to<br/>review and comment on it.</p>
<p>Volunteer Teacher</p>
<p>A. The PAR Panel shall determine the number of Volunteer Teachers</p>
<p>admitted into the program each year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of participation in the PAR program for the Volunteer Teacher is<br/>for peer assistance only. For participation in the program, the unit member<br/>must volunteer by May 1<sup>st</sup> of the prior school year. This program depends<br/>upon Support Provider and funding availability. When the volunteer applies to<br/>the program, he/she shall provide the PAR Panel with an initial draft of the<br/>goals, which he/she would like to accomplish by participation in PAR. The<br/>PAR Panel will review the application and will determine the nature and the<br/>level of support to be offered to the Volunteer Teacher. If a Support Provider<br/>is assigned to the Volunteer Teacher, the Support Provider shall maintain a<br/>log of assistance, which shall be provided to the PAR Panel and the<br/>Volunteer. It shall not be placed in the Volunteer’s personnel file unless the<br/>Volunteer so requests. All communications between the Volunteer Teacher<br/>and the Support Provider shall be confidential.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Volunteer Teacher may terminate his/her participation in the PAR<br/>program at any time.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All communication between the Support Provider and the Volunteer<br/>Teacher shall be confidential and, without the written consent of the<br/>Volunteer Teacher, shall not be shared with others, including the site<br/>principal, the evaluator, or the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher feels they need PAR support after the May 1 st voluntary<br/>referral deadline, he/she should contact their PAR Panel representative in<br/>order to establish a support plan for the remainder of the year and the<br/>following year if necessary. PAR Panel representative will submit the<br/>support plan to the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>Program Budget</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total annual expenses of the programs in the Article shall not exceed<br/>the District’s revenue for that year for the PAR Program. The PAR Panel<br/>shall work with the Business Manager and submit a proposed budget to<br/>the superintendent for Board approval. The proposed budget shall be<br/>designed to carry out the provisions of this Article and shall take into<br/>consideration:</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other relevant factors.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenues for this program shall be used for PAR, BTSA, and/or<br/>professional development or other educational activities.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>VII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Evaluation of Program</p>
<p>The PAR Panel shall evaluate annually the impact of PAR/BTSA in order to<br/>improve PAR. The review and evaluation may include interviews or surveys of<br/>PAR/BTSA participants, principals, and others as deemed appropriate. The PAR<br/>Panel shall submit this annual evaluation in writing, including any<br/>recommendations for improvement, to the Board and the Association no later<br/>than June 30.</p>
<p>VIII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program should be designed so that participants shall expect and are<br/>strongly encouraged to have a cooperative relationship between the<br/>Consulting Teacher and the principal/evaluator with respect to the process of<br/>PAR.

<p>Responsibilities and Duties</p>
<p>The responsibilities and duties of a Support Provider include but are not limited to the<br/>following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending all required Support Provider trainings held by the MCOE<br/>Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) Collaborative.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conducting meetings with the assigned teacher(s), as per the<br/>Collaborative’s expectations.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing rapport as a coach and mentor with the Beginning Teacher.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing individual support for the Beginning Teacher in all aspects of the<br/>BTSA process.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing and revising, as needed, an Individual Learning Plan (ILP) based<br/>on observations and reflective conversations with Beginning Teacher.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining records, logs, and evidence of work with Beginning Teacher.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilizing the release days offered by Dixie School District for formal and<br/>informal classroom observations, including pre- and post- conferences.<br/>Information gathered regarding practice/performance is confidential.<br/>Information regarding completion of BTSA requirements may be shared<br/>with site administrators, PAR Panel representatives, or Collaborative.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining full confidentiality.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Completing all responsibilities as required by the MCOE BTSA<br/>Collaborative.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>Application Process</p>
<p>The application process for Support Provider includes:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submitting an Application Form with Letters of Reference;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being interviewed by the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>Selection Process</p>
<p>Selection criteria of Support Providers are consistent with the MCOE BTSA<br/>Collaborative Support Provider’s specified roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Because of the timing of finalizing hiring for any given year and determining each new<br/>teacher’s eligibility to participate in the BTSA Program, each applicant to be a Support<br/>Provider should not assume that because s/he has applied to the process or has served as<br/>a Support Provider in previous years that s/he will be chosen to be a Support Provider. The<br/>PAR Panel considers the following when pairing Support Providers with Beginning<br/>Teachers in order to contribute to a strong and successful working relationship:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials held</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject matter knowledge</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevant background and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compatible orientations to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teaching and learning</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current site, grade level, and subject matter being taught</p>
<p>A full-time teacher serving as a Support Provider will be assigned to no more than two<br/>Beginning Teachers annually. A stipend will be provided to a Support Provider for his or<br/>her work with Beginning Teachers.</p>
<p>Conflict Resolution Procedure</p>
<p>The PAR Panel carefully considers each pairing and reserves the right to reconsider<br/>assignments anytime during the Beginning Teacher’s participation in the program when either<br/>the Support Provider or the Beginning Teacher is dissatisfied with the pairing. If a pairing is<br/>dissolved, the Support Provider will receive pro-rata payment for all commitments completed to<br/>that date. There is no expectation that another partnership will be found for that year. The<br/>Support Provider may apply to the program in subsequent years. Because the BTSA program<br/>is the vehicle used to clear a Beginning Teacher's credential and is intended to assist new<br/>teachers in remaining in the teaching profession, each Support Provider and Beginning<br/>Teacher should not worry about expressing concerns about the pairing. The goal is to have the<br/>partnership be successful and rewarding.</p>
<p>The procedures to ensure the success of the pairing include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning Teachers and Support Providers sign an Agreement with the<br/>Collaborative at the beginning of each year that asks them to<br/>“communicate questions or concerns about the Beginning Teacher<br/>Program” as well as participate in an end-of-year survey about the general<br/>effectiveness of the partnerships.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning Teachers and Support Providers complete a monthly Check-In<br/>Form for Dixie School District.</p>
<p>Dedicated and committed teachers working with a new generation of teachers will<br/>ensure a continued level of excellence for the Dixie School District. We strive to ensure<br/>participation in the BTSA program is a rewarding and valuable experience for both<br/>Beginning Teachers and Support Providers.</p>

<p>Teacher/PAR Conflict Resolution</p>
<p>The PAR Panel carefully considers each pairing of Support Provider and Teacher and<br/>reserves the right to reconsider assignments anytime during the Teacher’s participation<br/>in the program when either the support provider or the Teacher is dissatisfied with the<br/>pairing. If a pairing is dissolved, the Support Provider will receive pro-rata payment for<br/>all commitments completed to that date. The Support Provider may apply to the<br/>program in subsequent years. Because the BTSA program is the vehicle used to clear a<br/>Beginning Teacher's credential and is intended to assist new teachers in remaining in<br/>the teaching profession, each Support Provider and Beginning Teacher should not<br/>worry about expressing concerns about the pairing. The goal is to have the partnership<br/>be successful and rewarding.</p>
<p>If either the Support Provider and/or the Teacher is dissatisfied with the pairing the<br/>following needs to be completed:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dissatisfied person(s) shall contact their site PAR Panel member<br/>and/or the site principal to discuss the issue(s). If the site principal is<br/>contacted, he/she will refer the problem to the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel member will assist with the conflict resolution process as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Support Provider and the New Teacher should try to discuss<br/>the issue using good communication skills. Both should agree to<br/>listen carefully, keep eye contact, avoid interrupting or criticizing.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem will be documented by the PAR Panel member on the<br/>conflict resolution form. The issues should be summarized and<br/>mutually agreed upon.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions can be asked to clarify the problems/issues. Each<br/>person should make an effort to understand the problem from the<br/>other person’s perspective.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideas will be brainstormed in order to find a solution. Fair criteria<br/>will be used to determine the best solution. Each idea will be judged<br/>with both person’s interest in mind using reason and not emotion to<br/>evaluate an idea. Each person’s difference in perception will be<br/>respected.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within two weeks of the conflict resolution meeting date, the PAR Panel<br/>member/ mediator will follow up with both parties to determine if the<br/>ideas/solutions are working.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, the PAR Panel will meet within 30 days of receiving the<br/>Conflict Resolution Report Form to determine if the issue(s) can be solved<br/>or if another partnership is needed.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel may request a conference with the Support Provider<br/>and/or the Teacher in order to clarify the issue(s) prior to making a<br/>decision regarding the partnership.</p>
