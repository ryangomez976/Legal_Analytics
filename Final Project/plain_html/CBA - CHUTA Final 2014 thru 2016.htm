<p>ARTICLE - 12<br/>CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEE EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>Evaluation Process (Refer to Appendix C for Evaluation Rubric; Appendix D for timeline flowchart)</p>
<p>12.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is in probationary status shall be evaluated by the administration at</p>
<p>least three times per year in accordance to the timeline in Appendix D.</p>
<p>12.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is in permanent status shall be evaluated by the administration in</p>
<p>writing every second school year, no later than thirty (30) days before the end of the school<br/>year in which the evaluation takes place. The final evaluation document will include any<br/>formal observations conducted during the year.</p>
<p>12.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a permanent employee and his or her evaluator agree, the employee may be<br/>evaluated every five years, but only if he or she has been employed by the District for<br/>at least 10 years, is highly qualified (if he or she occupies a position that is required to<br/>be filled by a highly qualified professional as defined in 20 U.S.C. section 7801), and<br/>previous evaluations have rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards.</p>
<p>12.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee or the evaluator may withdraw consent to this five year arrangement at<br/>any time. The evaluator may rescind the five year evaluation period upon written<br/>notice to the employee.</p>
<p>12.1.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five year evaluation period shall be automatically rescinded upon the incidence of<br/>a negative evaluation in any part. Upon receiving a positive evaluation, an employee<br/>shall not be subject to a formal evaluation in two consecutive years.</p>
<p>12.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the provisions of this Article are not required for discipline and dismissal</p>
<p>of employees under Education Code Section 44932 except as required by law. This<br/>provision shall not, however, constitute a waiver of any rights an employee may have to<br/>adequate notice of performance deficiencies and adequate opportunity to improve.</p>
<p>12.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall evaluate and assess teacher competency as it relates to each of the</p>
<p>following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of pupils toward the standards of expected student achievement at<br/>each grade level in each area of study.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s adherence to curricular objectives.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment within the<br/>scope of the employee's responsibilities.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s performance of adjunct duties or job responsibilities.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>Evaluation and assessment of the competency of counselors, nurses, speech pathologists,<br/>and psychologists shall be determined as provided by Education Code section 44662(c).</p>
<p>12.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall appoint the evaluator(s) for each employee. Prior to October 31 of each</p>
<p>year, the evaluator shall meet with each employee for whom he or she has evaluation<br/>responsibility for that year for the purpose of establishing the employee’s goals, objectives<br/>and assessment methods. The evaluator and the employee shall attempt to agree<br/>mutually upon the goals, objectives and assessment methods that will be used in the<br/>evaluation process. Failure to reach agreement on any of the elements and/or<br/>components of evaluation shall necessitate that the evaluator and the employee<br/>designate a third party, or parties, agreeable to both, to mediate the disagreement.<br/>Resolution of the disagreement shall begin at the earliest possible time that disagreement</p>

<p>becomes apparent, but no later than October 1<sup>st</sup>. Should the dispute not be resolved by<br/>December 1, the District shall determine the reasonable goals objectives and assessment<br/>methods for the employee. During the course of the evaluation period, mitigating<br/>circumstances may arise which require modification of the evaluation parameters. The<br/>necessity for review of the evaluation criteria shall be determined mutually by the<br/>employee being evaluated and administration, and the determination of new evaluation<br/>elements shall be arrived at in accordance with this Article, with the waiver of time<br/>limitations.</p>
<p>Each evaluation of teacher competency shall be based upon at least one (1) observation,<br/>no less than twenty (20) minutes, and shall be followed within five (5) days by an<br/>evaluation conference in which the evaluator and the teacher shall review the<br/>observation^) and what is to be incorporated into the written evaluation. When<br/>applicable, observation(s) shall support negative comments or judgments included in the<br/>summary evaluation. The first observation shall be arranged by the evaluator and a<br/>probationary teacher at least one week in advance by mutual agreement of both parties.</p>
<p>If a permanent employee receives an unsatisfactory evaluation, the employee shall be<br/>evaluated annually, until the employee achieves a positive evaluation or is separated from<br/>the District (The aforementioned sentence will be suspended for 2014/15 school year<br/>during the pilot of the new evaluation tool). In addition, at any time during the school year,<br/>the District may notify the employee in writing that his or her job performance is<br/>unsatisfactory or that it needs improvement. In this event, the District and the employee<br/>shall meet as necessary to discuss specific recommendations for improvement of the<br/>employee’s performance. Any evaluation performed pursuant to this Article which<br/>contains an unsatisfactory rating of an employee’s performance in the area of teaching<br/>methods or instruction may include the requirement that the certificated employee shall,<br/>as determined necessary by the District, participate in a program designed to improve<br/>appropriate areas of the employee’s performance and/or to further pupil achievement and<br/>the instructional objectives of the District. The District will reimburse the employee for<br/>required expenses up to $500.00.</p>
<p>If subsequent remedial action eliminates the negative evaluation and/or the identified<br/>deficiencies, a written statement to that effect shall be attached to the evaluation.</p>
<p>No teacher shall be held accountable for any aspect of the educational program over<br/>which he or she has no authority to correct deficiencies.</p>
<p>Non-management employees shall not be required to participate in the evaluation and/or<br/>observation of other non-management employees nor shall they be required to assess<br/>their own performance for the record.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, direct observation shall serve as the primary source of information<br/>for an employee’s evaluation. The evaluator shall not base an employee’s evaluation on<br/>material which is untrue or without a basis in fact. Evaluations are not be to be based<br/>upon unsubstantiated rumor, hearsay, or unfounded commentary.</p>
<p>The established grievance resolution procedure of the contract may be utilized for<br/>processing any disputes which arise over evaluation procedures. In the event that a<br/>dispute arises and such dispute is resolved in favor of the employee, no record of the<br/>disputed evaluation shall be kept by the District in any file, office or place. Any such<br/>record(s) as exist(s) shall be delivered to the employee disposition.</p>
