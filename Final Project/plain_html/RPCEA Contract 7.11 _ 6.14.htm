<p>Article 3 • Procedure for Evaluation</p>

<p>professional growth. They may observe each other's classes,<br/>give each other comments about those observations, and discuss<br/>common professional concerns.

<p>A permanent unit member who received a satisfactory<br/>evaluation during his/her last evaluation cycle may, with the<br/>mutual consent of his/her designated evaluator, elect to use the<br/>alternative evaluation option.</p>
<p>3.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of Alternative Evaluation Option</p>
<p>The unit member shall inform the designated evaluator of<br/>his/her interest in this option at least ten (10) days prior to the<br/>annual Pre-evaluation Conference. The designated evaluator<br/>shall indicate his/her consent or lack of consent within five (5)<br/>working days of notification by the unit member. If the<br/>designated evaluator does not consent, the unit member may<br/>appeal this decision using the procedures outlined in Article 3.6.</p>

<p>Mid-year Meeting(s)</p>
<p>During the course of the school year, a minimum of one<br/>meeting shall be held between the unit member and the<br/>designated evaluator to discuss the unit member's progress on<br/>the plan.

The unit member shall<br/>provide the designated evaluator with a written Atemative<br/>Evaluation Summary of his/her accomplishments either prior to<br/>this meeting or at the beginning of the meeting.</p>
<p>Final Alternative Evaluation Report</p>
<p>A written Alternative Evaluation Report, completed by the site<br/>administrator, will be provided to the unit member not later<br/>than thirty (30) days before the last school day.</p>

<p>Immediately prior to and during the period of Family Care<br/>Leave, the District shall allow the unit member to elect to use<br/>his/her accrued sick leave or any other paid or unpaid leave<br/>provided in the contract or in law. The use of such leaves shall<br/>not be interpreted so as to shorten family care leave even though<br/>it extends the duration of the absence of the unit member beyond<br/>the term of the Family Care Leave.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Article 14 • Leaves</p>
<p>14.18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall continue to be entitled to participate in<br/>health plans, pension and retirement plans, and supplemental<br/>unemployment benefit plans to the same extent and under the<br/>same conditions as apply to an unpaid leave taken for any other<br/>purpose.</p>

<p>14.18.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member's need for family care leave is foreseeable,<br/>he/she shall give the District reasonable advance notice.

<p>An estimate of the amount of time the health care</p>
<p>provider believes the employee needs to care for the<br/>person requiring care</p>
<p>4. A statement that the serious health condition warrants<br/>the participation of a family member to provide care<br/>during a period of the treatment or supervision of the<br/>person requiring care.</p>
<p>If additional leave is needed when the time estimated by the<br/>health cafe provider expires, the unit member shall provide<br/>recertification as specified above.</p>
<p>14.18.10 The District may refuse to grant a request for family care leave if<br/>this refusal is necessary to prevent undue hardship to school or<br/>District operations. The Fair Employment and Housing<br/>Commission is required to adopt regulations which specify what<br/>constitutes undue hardship. The District agrees to be bound by<br/>such regulations in making its determination.</p>
<p>Until such time as the Fair Employment and Housing<br/>Commission regulations are adopted, the following language<br/>shall apply:</p>
<p>In the event the District refuses to grant Family Care Leave, it<br/>shall not do so except for cause and shall provide the applicant<br/>with a written analysis of the hardship which the District would<br/>suffer.

<p>Article 14 • Leaves</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>unit member, seek to reverse the District's decision by going to<br/>expedited binding arbitration, skipping intermediate steps of the<br/>Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>14.18.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not refuse to hire and shall not discharge, fine,<br/>suspend, expel, or discriminate against any employee because<br/>he/she exercises the right to family care leave or because he/she<br/>gives information or testimony related to his/her or another<br/>person's family care leave in an inquiry related to family leave<br/>rights.</p>
<p>14.18.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be required to grant a unit member and the<br/>other parent of the child family care leave totaling more than the<br/>amount specified in 14.18.4, nor to grant an employee family care<br/>leave for any period of time in which the child's other parent is<br/>also taking family care leave from employment or is<br/>unemployed.</p>

<p>As a result of the closure of Mountain Shadows Middle School at the end of<br/>the 2009-2010 school year, the parties agree to the following regarding<br/>transfers for Creekside and Mountain Shadows unit members for<br/>assignments for the 2010-2011 school year.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holding Multiple Subjects credentials shall have</p>
<p>first opportunity, in seniority order, to transfer to a sixth grade<br/>vacancy at an elementary site. Because these are involuntary<br/>transfers, the request of the teacher being transferred shall be</p>
<p>Appendix E • Memoranda of Understanding</p>
<p>honored.</p>
<p>Unit members holding Single Subject credentials shall be assigned<br/>to teaching positions at the middle school consistent with the<br/>subject authorized by their teaching credentials.</p>
<p>Vacancies in grades 7 through 12 shall be posted for Creekside and<br/>Mountain Shadows teachers to request a voluntary transfer<br/>pursuant to Article 7.2, except that the deadline shall be five (5)<br/>working days after posting rather than ten (10).</p>
<p>Unit members holding Single Subject credentials who lack<br/>seniority to remain at the middle school shall be involuntarily<br/>transferred to vacant positions pursuant to the procedures<br/>outlined in Article 7.3, Involuntary Transfers.</p>
<p>A member of the Human Resources department will meet with<br/>individual Creekside and Mountain Shadows unit members in<br/>seniority order at their respective school sites after the five (5) day<br/>period has elapsed. During this meeting, each unit member will<br/>indicate his/her choice of assignment for the 2010-2011 school year.<br/>Any unit member who is unable to select at that time will be given<br/>twenty-four (24) dock hours in which to make a dedsion. If<br/>he/she cannot dedde, the District will move to the next person on<br/>the seniority list, and the unit member will move to the bottom of</p>

<p>Unit members transferred from Creekside and Mountain Shadows<br/>will have the option to change assignments for the 2010-2011<br/>school year, if new positions become available through the tenth<br/>day of the school year. After this date, the assignments will<br/>continue through the 2010-2011 school year.</p>
<p>Creekside and Mountain Shadows unit members will retain their<br/>status as an involuntary transferee through the 2011-2012 school<br/>year and will be afforded the rights outlined in Article 7.3.9,<br/>regardless of whether they choose to transfer to a new position<br/>that became available after the initial assignments were made as<br/>described in item 7 above.</p>
<p>The District anticipates that the list of vacancies for sixth grade<br/>positions will be available by the week of March 22,2010.<br/>Vacancies for positions in grades 7 through 12 shall be available as</p>
