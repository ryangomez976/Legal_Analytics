<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District and the Federation mutually agree, rules for<br/>expedited arbitration shall be used.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or<br/>modify the terms of this Agreement or the written policies, rules,<br/>regulations, and procedures of the District.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall hear and determine one grievance at a time<br/>unless mutually agreed otherwise. The parties shall endeavor to<br/>handle in an expeditious and convenient manner grievances which<br/>involve the same or similar facts and issues.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to<br/>make written arguments, the arbitrator shall render, in writing, to<br/>all parties his/her findings.</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certified court reporter shall be employed to record, verbatim,<br/>the entire arbitration hearing if requested by either the District, the<br/>Federation, or the arbitrator. If the court reporter was requested by<br/>the arbitrator, the court reporter’s costs shall be borne equally by<br/>the District and the Federation; however, if the request was made<br/>by the District or the Federation, whichever party requested the<br/>court reporter shall bear all the court reporter’s costs. The cost of<br/>transcripts shall be borne by the party ordering such transcripts.</p>
<p>9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited<br/>to, per diem expense, his/her travel and subsistence expenses, and<br/>the cost of any hearing room shall be borne equally by the Board<br/>and the Federation. All other costs will be borne by the party<br/>incurring them.</p>
<p>10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.</p>

<p>14) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not render any recommendation or award that<br/>conflicts with or alters this Agreement. It is understood, however,<br/>that the arbitrator shall interpret this Agreement in accordance with<br/>acceptable rules of contract construction.</p>
<p>15) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such financial<br/>reimbursements or other remedies as judged to be proper.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>16) Each party shall bear the full costs of its representation in the<br/>arbitration. The arbitrator’s fees and charges shall be divided<br/>equally between the Federation and the District.</p>

<p>All unit members requesting the above shall notify their administrator/supervisor<br/>in sufficient time so that proper arrangements may be made for substitutes.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officers of the Federation or designees may be given release time for attendance<br/>at organization meetings and conferences. The cost of substitutes shall be borne<br/>by the Federation or the unit member.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves of Absence Without Pay</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental Leave</p>
<p>Parental leave may be granted to natural or adoptive parents for a period of up to<br/>one year, upon request.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest, Illness, Personal Hardship Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may be granted leaves of absence by the Board in excess of<br/>one (1) month without pay under the following conditions:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leave is requested for the purpose of rest, illness, or personal<br/>hardship. A doctor's statement may be required to clarify health<br/>requests.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves of absence may not exceed one (1) year, unless by special<br/>action of the Board.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence necessitated by subpoena shall not be deemed an absence<br/>for pay purposes.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member granted a leave of absence for a year is assured that upon<br/>his/her return to work, he/she will be reassigned to a position comparable</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>to that which he/she vacated, provided that the member on leave notifies<br/>the Superintendent on or before the first day of March that it is his/her<br/>intention to resume his/her duties the ensuing school year. Failure to notify<br/>the Superintendent of intention to return to duty on or before the first day<br/>of March prior to the ensuing school year automatically terminates<br/>employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAMILY CARE AND MEDICAL LEAVE</p>
<p>Employees may be granted family care and medical leave pursuant to</p>
<p>Government Code Section 12945.2 under the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave under this Article is unpaid. For a period not to exceed twelve (12)<br/>weeks, employees on such leave will continue to be covered by the<br/>District<sup>5</sup> s medical, dental and vision plans. Employees will not continue<br/>to be covered under life insurance and/or any other non-health benefit<br/>plan, including District retirement contributions. Employees may continue<br/>to make the appropriate contributions for continued coverage for life<br/>insurance and/or non-health benefits plans by direct payments to these<br/>plans. The District may recover the cost of premiums paid for medical,<br/>dental and vision coverage in the event that an employee who takes leave<br/>under this Article fails to return to work for reasons other than due to<br/>his/her disability. Recovery may also occur should the employee separate<br/>from employment during the first thirty (30) days of their return from<br/>Family Care and Medical Leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both husband and wife are employed by the District, leave will be<br/>limited for birth or adoption, not to exceed a combined total of twelve (12)<br/>weeks in a year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall have been employed for a minimum of twelve (12)<br/>months and at least 1250 hours during this period to be eligible for family<br/>care and medical leave hereunder.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave may granted for birth, adoption, or foster care of a child within<br/>twelve (12) months of the birth or placement, or the serious health<br/>condition of the employee's child. Leave under this Section may taken on<br/>an intermittent basis with the approval of the School Board.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave may be granted for the serious health condition of a family member<br/>or the employee. Family member is defined as mother, father, son or<br/>daughter under the age of 18, or a child above that age who is incapable of<br/>self-care because of mental or physical disability, or any relative living in<br/>the immediate household of the unit member. Leave under this Section<br/>may be taken intermittently if medically necessary. If an employee's<br/>request for intermittent leave is foreseeable based upon planned medical<br/>treatment, the District may require the employee to transfer temporarily to</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that better<br/>accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee’s regular<br/>position.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;‘serious health condition” means an illness, injury, impairment, or<br/>physical or mental condition that involves either the following: inpatient<br/>care in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility; or continuing<br/>treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider.<br/>Certification of a serious health condition shall include the date upon<br/>which the serious health condition shall include the date upon which the<br/>serious health condition began, the probable duration of the condition,<br/>appropriate medical facts regarding the condition, a statement that the<br/>employee is needed to care for a family member or a child or that the<br/>employee is unable to perform his/her function. In the case of intermittent<br/>leave, the dates and durations of treatments to be given shall also be<br/>provided. The District may require subsequent re-certification on a<br/>reasonable basis.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require that a second opinion be obtained at District<br/>expense. In the event of conflicting opinions, the District, at its own<br/>expense, may require a third and final opinion that shall be binding.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who meets all the requirements of eligibility shall be entitled<br/>to twelve (12) work weeks of unpaid leave in any twelve (12) month<br/>period. A twelve (12) month period commences on the first day of leave.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may elect, or the District may require, an employee to<br/>substitute for family care and medical leave, any paid or unpaid leave to<br/>which they may be entitled.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may elect or the District may require an employee to<br/>substitute for family care and medical leave, accrued sick leave for the<br/>serious health condition of the employee.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee and the District must mutually agree for the employee to<br/>substitute for family care and medical leave, accrued sick leave for the<br/>birth, adoption or foster care of a child, or also for the serious health<br/>condition of a child, spouse or parent of the employee.</p>
<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any family care and medical leave taken for a disability caused by<br/>pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition shall be in addition to<br/>pregnancy disability leave provided for in Government Code Section<br/>12945. Health care benefits will be provided in accordance with<br/>California Fair Employment and Housing Commission regulations.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon expiration of leave hereunder, an employee shall be entitled to be<br/>restored to the position of employment held when the leave commenced,<br/>or, in the event the position has been eliminated, to an equivalent or</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>comparable position. As a condition of restoration of an employee whose<br/>leave was due to the employee’s own serious health condition, which<br/>made the employee unable to perform his/her job, the employee shall<br/>obtain and present a “fitness for duty” certification from the health care<br/>provider that the employee is able to resume the essential duties required<br/>by the position with or without reasonable accommodation. Failure to<br/>provide such certification shall result in denial of restoration.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above negotiated provisions are intended to, and shall comply with<br/>the provisions of Government Code section 12945.2 and the forthcoming<br/>regulations of the Fair Employment and Housing Commission covering<br/>family care and medical leave and the regulations of the U.S. Department<br/>of Labor.</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alleged violations of this provision shall be filed with the Fair<br/>Employment and Housing Commission or the United States Department<br/>of Labor and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure contained in<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel and/or Study Leave</p>
<p>Leaves of absence for travel and/or study purposes, not to exceed one (1) school<br/>year, may be granted to permanent employees only, and shall be at the discretion<br/>of the Board.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F ederation W ork</p>
<p>In the event a member of the certificated bargaining unit is selected to work Ml<br/>time for the Federation, that individual may be granted, upon request, a leave of<br/>absence for up to one year without pay.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>A. Elementary, Middle, and High School student-classroom teacher class sizes shall be<br/>established pursuant to the following staffing ratios:</p>
<p>K-3 and 4-6 shall be computed separately.</p>
<p>Kindergarten-3 - As per California class size reduction</p>
<p>The staffing ratio for Kindergarten shall be “K enrollment divided by 24.” Transitional<br/>Kindergarten (TK) is considered to be “Kindergarten” by the State and therefore is<br/>included in this ratio for purposes of this Article. A reasonable effort shall be made to<br/>achieve equitable class sizes among the Kindergarten classes and to keep each class size<br/>as low as practical.</p>
<p>In addition, the parties acknowledge that “As per California class size reduction” has<br/>taken on new meaning under the new State funding model known as the Local Control<br/>Funding Formula (LCFF). As a condition of receiving the additional funding grant for<br/>K-3 Class size reduction under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) (a.k.a. Grade<br/>Span Adjustment (GS A)) the District is required to make progress toward maintaining an<br/>average class enrollment of not more than 24 pupils for each school site in kindergarten<br/>and grades 1 to 3 upon full implementation of the LCFF, as such progress is defined in<br/>Education Code section 42238.02, However, the law authorizes a district and its<br/>certificated union to negotiate an alternative annual average class size enrollment for each<br/>school site (Education Code section 42238.02 (d) (3) (B)).</p>
<p>Therefore, the parties agree that the grades 1 -3 maximum average class-size enrollment at<br/>each school site shall be 27:1 for 2014-2015, 26:1 for 2015-2016, 25:1 for 2016-2017,<br/>and 24:1 for 2017-2018 and all subsequent years thereafter.</p>
<p>In the event that students enroll after the end of the 30<sup>th</sup> calendar day from the start of<br/>instruction and cause the District to be unable to comply with these maximum average<br/>class-sizes at a particular school site, the District may exceed the class-size maximum<br/>until the end of the current school year. The District shall notify NMCFT in the event<br/>that the District needs to exercise this exception.</p>
<p>If at any time the District learns that compliance with the foregoing contractual<br/>provisions will likely result in penalties which would reduce or eliminate the additional<br/>funding grant for K-3 GSA, the parties agree to meet and negotiate to discuss and<br/>implement a mutually agreed solution.</p>
<p>Grades 4-6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enrollment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divided&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31</p>
<p>Staffing grades 7-8 will be calculated as follows: enrollment divided by 31 times 6<br/>periods with the product divided by 5 — staff allocation for 7 — 8*.</p>
<p>Staffing grades 9 — 12 will be calculated as follows: enrollment divided by 31 times 6<br/>periods with the product divided by 5 - staff allocation for 9 — 12*.</p>
<p>A schedule that includes a common preparation period at grades 9 — 12 results in a<br/>proportional reduction in class size.</p>
<p>* School staffing ratios that exceed 0.4 will be rounded up and the school will receive one<br/>additional staff member.</p>
<p>At grades 9 — 12, one half of the total allocation of resource specialist teachers will be<br/>included as part of the regular staffing.</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2011-12 school year, the high school staffing ratio shall include one-<br/>quarter of the total allocation of resource specialist teachers as part of the regular staffing.</p>
<p>These staffing formulas exclude Special Education staff and other categorically ftmded<br/>staff.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total teaching load per high school teacher shall not exceed 165 student contacts per<br/>day excluding the Silent Sustained Reading/home room period. In some classes, larger<br/>group instruction is recognized as valuable so those are excluded from the preceding<br/>ratios. These classes might include, but are not limited to, band, chorus, drill team,<br/>physical education, typing, or where an individual teacher requests to exceed the average<br/>class size as set forth herein.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ratios or contacts are exceeded as set forth herein, as of the end of the 30th calendar<br/>day from the start of instruction and thereafter, a conference shall be held, at the request<br/>of the Federation with the appropriate administrator to discuss and implement a mutually<br/>agreed-upon solution. A reasonable effort shall be made at all levels to achieve equitable<br/>class sizes and class loads through rescheduling. Solutions may include, but are not<br/>limited to: additional compensation, transfer of students, and paraprofessional assistance.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above class sizes are intended to be maxim urns as described and when practical, the<br/>District intends to staff at lower sizes.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size Task Force (See Appendix T [TA 3/26/12])</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-2013 Staffing Ratios (See Appendix T [TA 3/26/12])</p>
<p>The class size maximum for Special Day Classes (SDC) will be 14 students. If this<br/>number is exceeded and has not been rectified within 10 working days, the Federation<br/>and the District will meet together to achieve an equitable solution.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XV<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>All probationary and temporary employees shall be evaluated at least once annually. Permanent<br/>employees shall be evaluated every other year, except that permanent employees with<br/>unsatisfactory evaluations or evaluations showing serious need for improvement may be<br/>evaluated in consecutive years.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of instructional personnel shall be conducted in accordance with the<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession, which are as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in learning.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and maintaining an effective learning environment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and organizing subject matter.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing student learning.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a professional educator.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-instructional personnel shall be evaluated based on the fulfillment of defined job<br/>responsibilities.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forms to be utilized in the evaluation process will be jointly developed by the District<br/>and the Federation.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals and supervisors assigned as evaluators must have demonstrated competence in<br/>supervision and evaluation.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A basic principle to be followed in this process is that each unit member, and especially<br/>probationary employees, is entitled to have his/her needs for training and assistance<br/>recognized. The evaluation process should utilize the resources available.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, prior to November 1, the employees to be evaluated shall confer with their<br/>evaluator to develop the plan to be used in the evaluation process. This plan shall be</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession and other areas of concern<br/>identified by the evaluator or the employee. This plan shall include agreed upon criteria<br/>by which success in each designated area will be measured.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan developed under F above includes recommendations for the improvement of<br/>the employee’s performance based upon past evaluations, the evaluator will provide<br/>specific recommendations for improvement and the assistance will be given to the<br/>employee, including training, toward improvement.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan may be modified at any time upon the mutual agreement of the employee and<br/>the evaluator.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that an evaluation plan cannot be agreed upon during the initial conference,<br/>the evaluator will develop the plan which he/she intends to use in the evaluation of the<br/>employee, and shall inform the employee of the plan. Should the plan, in the judgment of<br/>the employee, be unfair, the employee shall have the right to attach his comments to the<br/>evaluation plan and the evaluation summary, which comments shall become permanent<br/>attachments to these documents.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No less than two formal observations shall be conducted for each employee being<br/>evaluated. The dates and times of the observations shall be mutually agreed upon by the<br/>evaluator and the teacher. Prior to the observation, there will be a pre-conference.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 48 hours following a formal observation of a unit member, the evaluator and unit<br/>member shall schedule a post observation conference. The time limits may be extended<br/>for good cause or by mutual agreement. The written summation of the observation will<br/>be provided to the employee within 10 working days following the post observation<br/>conference.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final evaluation summary, inclusive of each of the areas evaluated, shall be written by<br/>the evaluator, and a copy must be given to the employee not later than thirty (30) days<br/>prior to the last day of school scheduled on the calendar adopted by the District. A<br/>conference must be held between the evaluator and the employee within 10 working days<br/>of receipt of the written evaluation to discuss the evaluation.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A PROFESSIONAL PARTNERS program is available as an alternative to the formal<br/>evaluation process. Eligibility and procedures are defined below.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be eligible to participate in the Professional Partners</p>
<p>Program as an alternative to the i*egular evaluation process, a teacher must:</p>
