<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On work days of non-student attendance, starting times and ending times may be<br/>modified by the District so long as the total length of the work day is not extended<br/>beyond that which is provided in Section 6.2.</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Development Days</p>
<p>There will be three (3) additional days for Professional Development thus the work year<br/>will increase to one hundred eighty-five (185) days. Three (3) additional Professional<br/>Development Days are added at full pay to the salary schedule. Two (2) of these days are<br/>to be added to the school calendar, and the third day is to be arranged individually by the<br/>teachers with pre-approval from the site administrator.

<p>Page 9 of 61</p>

However, it is<br/>recognized that a reasonable variation in the amount of such assignments between unit<br/>members may exist.</p>
