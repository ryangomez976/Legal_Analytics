<p>ARTICLE 1. Agreement<br/>Preamble</p>
<p>This collective bargaining agreement is made and entered into this August 5, 2014, by and between the<br/>Newport-Mesa Unified School District and Newport-Mesa Federation of Teachers, CFT/AFT/AFL-CIO.</p>
<p>The District and Federation may mutually agree to engage in the interest-based process for collective<br/>bargaining until such time as either or both parties find the process is no longer in their interest. Further,<br/>both parties agree that all relevant participants receive training in the interest-based negotiations process.</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles and provisions contained within this agreement constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>agreement by and between the Board of Education of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District,<br/>hereinafter referred to as &quot;District,&quot; and the Newport-Mesa Federation of Teachers, CFT/AFT/AFL-<br/>CIO, hereinafter referred to as &quot;Federation.&quot;</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement is entered into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540-3549, of the Government<br/>Code of the State of California. The District and Federation will follow all legal requirements</p>
<p>relative to employee behavior.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this contract shall apply to those employees who are designated under Article 2<br/>below.</p>
<p>1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement shall be effective on July 1, 2014 and shall remain in full force and effect until June<br/>30, 2017. This agreement shall not be extended orally and it is understood that it shall expire on the<br/>date indicated, unless otherwise provided herein.</p>
<p>1.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2015-16 and 2016-17 negotiations, the parties may each open two (2) articles of their<br/>choice in addition to Article 12 Salaries and Article 13/16 Health and Welfare<br/>Benefits/Retiree Benefits. The parties will make their best efforts to begin negotiations by<br/>March 1<sup>st</sup> each year on reopeners in this agreement.</p>
<p>1.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mutual agreement of both parties any article may be negotiated to resolve problems.</p>
<p>1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall appoint its representatives to contract committees, and the Newport-Mesa<br/>Federation of Teachers shall appoint its representatives to contract committees.</p>
<p>1.5.1 Contract committees shall present their recommendations to the Negotiating Team. Final<br/>agreement shall be subject to ratification by the Board of Education and by the Newport-<br/>Mesa Federation of Teachers.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2. Recognition</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes the Federation as the exclusive representative as defined by Section<br/>3540.1(e) of the Government Code. The exclusive representative shall represent all certificated<br/>employees who are employed in positions listed in Section 2.1.1 below and who are either regular<br/>full- or part-time employees, whether permanent or probationary; or, temporary contract employees<br/>as defined by law.</p>
<p>2.1.1 Unit members include the following certificated employees:</p>
<p>Adult Education and other hourly certificated as defined in Article 18.1</p>
<p>Classroom and Resource Teachers</p>
<p>Elementary Counselors</p>
<p>Federal/Special Projects Teachers</p>
<p>Librarians</p>
<p>Nurses</p>
<p>Program Specialists<br/>Psychologists<br/>Resource Specialists<br/>Secondary Counselors<br/>Social Workers<br/>Special Education Teachers<br/>Speech and Language Pathologists<br/>Teachers on Special Assignment</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclusive representative shall not represent employees who are substitutes, part-time hourly<br/>employees not working daily and who are employed for less than seventy-five (75) percent of the<br/>number of days of each school year.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-Time Administrative Intern</p>
<p>The Federation and the District agree there may be from time-to-time the necessity to hire an<br/>Administrative Intern, on a full-time basis, to provide assistance to site and District administrators<br/>by performing administrative tasks. However, the job description for these Administrative Intern<br/>positions is at odds with Article 2 of the N-MFT/N-MUSD contract in that they are providing<br/>administrative duties. The Federation and District recognize the inherent conflict of interest that<br/>these positions have in representation rights by the N-MFT. During the time a certificated member<br/>is in one of these Administrative Intern positions, they will not be a recognized as part of the N-<br/>MFT bargaining unit. All N-MFT dues will be discontinued immediately upon taking an<br/>Administrative Intern position. If the Administrative Intern was a permanent teacher and they elect<br/>to return to a certificated position in the District that is recognized in Article 2.1, they will once<br/>again be represented by N-MFT.</p>

<p>4</p>
<p>The instructional minutes shall meet the requirements of Education Code Section<br/>46201 - 46206, inclusive.</p>
<p>3.2.3.1 Under a District-Federation Trust Agreement, (See Appendix D) schools may apply<br/>for waivers to reconfigure instructional minutes for school improvement and staff<br/>development through the Joint Coordinating Committee for Restructuring.</p>
<p>3.2.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waivers that reconfigure a site’s instructional minutes and calendar<br/>through the approval of the Joint Coordinating Committee for<br/>Restructuring will continue each year without change unless (a) the<br/>faculty of the school initiates the waiver process to change the current<br/>configuration, or (b) either the District or the Federation requests a review<br/>of that continuing waiver.</p>
<p>3.2.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the faculty or administration may schedule open discussions to<br/>probe the need for, and value in, changing the configuration of<br/>instructional minutes. In order to facilitate incremental change, the<br/>discussion and voting process may be done as many times in succession<br/>during the school year as a site desires. The discussions may lead to a<br/>definite, single new alternative configuration that will (a) be cleared by<br/>Nutrition Services, Transportation and Fiscal departments, (b) be<br/>presented to the faculty for continued discussion, (c) be held for a wait<br/>and reflection period of at least five (5) school days, and (d) be subject to<br/>a waiver vote against the existing configuration of instructional minutes<br/>(as outlined in Appendix D). If the alternative receives 2/3 support of the<br/>total eligible certificated staff, it will be submitted to the JCCR on a<br/>completed district waiver application. If not, the existing configuration of<br/>instructional minutes will continue.</p>
<p>3.2.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JCCR will review the application and may recommend the waiver for<br/>approval to the Board of Education for implementation. For waivers to<br/>be implemented in the Fall of the following year, the school must submit<br/>the completed district waiver application to the JCCR by May 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

<p>3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each classroom teacher in grades 4-6 shall receive on a weekly basis a<br/>conference/preparation period equal to sixty (60) consecutive minutes per week. The on-site<br/>workday shall not, however, be reduced as a consequence of the conference/preparation time<br/>for such members.</p>
<p>3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the conference/preparation time allotted in 3.3.1, each classroom teacher in<br/>grades 4-6 at the elementary school shall receive, on a weekly average basis,<br/>conference/preparation time equal to a minimum of eighty (80) minutes per week.<br/>Scheduling is to be determined with staff involvement.

<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>elementary sites will receive three (3) on-site release days per year with a substitute teacher<br/>to prepare for report cards and parent conferences. One release day per trimester is allocated<br/>and may not be banked. Each day must be used in the trimester allocated and may not be<br/>carried over to the following trimester or school year.</p>
<p>3.3.3 K-3 Classroom Teacher Conference/Preparation: School site principals may consider recess<br/>rotations, music time coverage or other appropriate no cost site options to allow for K-3<br/>classroom teacher conference/preparation time.</p>
<p>The District/NMFT have expressed an interest in negotiating up to three (3) onsite substitute<br/>release days for K-3 teachers when it becomes operationally and economically feasible in<br/>future years. Due to the implementation of Common Core State Standards and other<br/>curriculum initiatives, substitute resources are limited and cannot be expanded at this time.<br/>Further review and discussion will occur when other programs are implemented and<br/>substitute resources are available.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall be entitled to a minimum thirty-minute (30) duty-free uninterrupted lunch<br/>break.</p>
<p>3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each full-time unit member assigned to a regular classroom in grades 7-12 shall receive on a weekly<br/>basis the equivalent of one (1) planning, preparation, or conference period each day.</p>
<p>3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member who works at two (2) or more sites on one (1) day shall have sufficient time to<br/>travel between work sites.</p>
<p>3.7 Mandatory Meetings</p>
<p>3.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monthly Time Limit</p>
<p>Mandatory meeting times called by the principal shall not exceed four (4) hours per<br/>month. This parameter may be modified using the waiver process to increase<br/>meeting time above the four (4) hour per month limit.</p>
<p>3.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory Meetings Designated by the Principal</p>
<p>Meetings under this section must be designated as “mandatory” by the principal in<br/>writing, prior to the beginning of the meeting to be considered a required meeting<br/>under this section.</p>
<p>3.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory Meeting Definition</p>
<p>Mandatory meetings can be held 1) at a time when students are not in session<br/>(before or after instruction) or 2) on a non-instructional day. Mandatory meetings<br/>include but are not limited to: collaboration team, grade level, department, content<br/>area, cross curricular, operational, zone collaboration and staff development within</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>the four (4) hour per month limit. The topics and structure are determined by the<br/>principal within the four hour per month limit.</p>
<p>Mandatory meetings do not include meetings during the day while students are in<br/>session and/or do not include activities that fall within the professional<br/>responsibilities such as: IEPs, parent meetings, preparation time, voluntary staff<br/>development opportunities, time when teachers are released for collaboration while<br/>students are in session, District-wide staff development days, duties related to role<br/>and recompense responsibilities, miscellaneous meetings related to professional<br/>responsibilities, voluntary meetings, etc.</p>
<p>3.7.4 Schedule for Mandatory Meeting</p>
<p>The schedule for mandatory meetings for the month will be made available at least<br/>two (2) weeks in advance, except when the principal determines a special meeting<br/>is necessary to meet the needs of the school.</p>
<p>Mandatory meetings may commence before students are in session (i.e. late starts)<br/>or within fifteen (15) minutes (or after duty free lunch) after students are<br/>dismissed. An exception to this provision will be made to accommodate zone<br/>collaboration where schools have a different end time for students and travel time<br/>to the host school is needed. Mandatory meetings will not exceed ninety (90)<br/>minutes on a day when students are in session.</p>
<p>3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide opportunities for unit members to visit one (1) other classroom per year,<br/>within or outside the District for the purpose of improving instruction, with the approval of the<br/>principal, who will make the arrangements.</p>
<p>3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Classroom Supervision</p>
<p>It shall be the responsibility of the school principal, with staff involvement, to assign non-classroom<br/>supervision duties to all school staff (including administration) in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<p>3.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the option to exchange one instructional day for one of the two staff<br/>development days, as identified on an approved school calendar, if necessary due to unforeseen<br/>circumstances. The District will contact NMFT to discuss the proposed substitution and place the<br/>item on the Board agenda for consideration. The NMFT will be asked for a written recommendation<br/>for Board review. Upon approval by the Board of Education, this exchange, as agreed upon by the<br/>parties to resolve unforeseen circumstances, will be implemented. The number of teacher paid<br/>workdays in a school year will not be reduced because of the instructional day/non-instructional day<br/>substitution under this Section.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>

<p>6.4 Alternative Evaluation</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative teacher evaluation process is designed to increase opportunities for<br/>professional growth available to the District's tenured teaching staff. It serves as an<br/>alternative to the traditional performance evaluation process to encourage accomplished<br/>teachers to continue their professional development and personal growth. The evaluation<br/>options provide flexibility, permitting teachers to grow in self-chosen areas of interest.</p>
<p>6.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants will be tenured teachers who have consistently demonstrated competence in<br/>previous evaluations, and who wish to engage in a personalized program of professional<br/>growth. There will be no limitation on the number of participants at each site. The principal<br/>and teacher may determine a mutually agreeable alternative evaluation option.</p>
<p>July 1. 2014</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating teachers will set meaningful goals which will serve as a focus for their<br/>professional growth, and establish suitable criteria for the evaluation of that growth.</p>
<p>6.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a conference held prior to November 1, the teacher and the administrator will agree on<br/>these goals, the evaluation option, and the criteria for evaluation.</p>
<p>6.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Guidelines</p>
<p>6.4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers and administrators are encouraged to be creative in developing new</p>
<p>or innovative options for use as evaluative tools. A wide variety of<br/>evaluation designs are possible. Some possible options are:</p>
<p>Portfolio: A portfolio serves as a compilation of materials selected by the<br/>teacher to create a record of actions taken and progress made in meeting<br/>his/her goals. Sample inclusions may be a log of activities, samples of<br/>student work, examples of newly developed curriculum, photographs, video<br/>tapes, or student evaluations of activities related to the teacher's professional<br/>growth goals.</p>
<p>Reflective Journal: A journal may serve as a mirror for a teacher's experience<br/>in the classroom. The act of written reflection upon one's teaching can focus<br/>efforts to refine teaching skills and lead to solutions for specific instructional<br/>challenges.</p>
<p>Peer Coaching: The purpose of the peer coach is to provide effective<br/>feedback on the teacher's progress toward professional growth goals through<br/>a series of meetings that may include pre-observation conferences, classroom<br/>observation, and discussion. The peer coach is selected by the teacher with<br/>the approval of the administrator. The teacher may also participate in the<br/>Peer Partners program.</p>
<p>Classroom Action Research: The teacher will select and identify a specific<br/>concept, instructional strategy, or theoretical approach to be studied in the<br/>classroom. The action research will involve an in-depth study of the effects<br/>of implementing a particular practice in the classroom</p>
<p>National Board Certification: Participation in the National Board<br/>Certification program meets the requirements of this article and is recognized<br/>as one of the highest forms of professional development as an educator.</p>
<p>6.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of Outcomes</p>
<p>6.4.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the planning process the teacher and administrator will determine the<br/>monitoring schedule. Prior to the end of the year, the teacher and</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>administrator will meet to review the teacher’s progress. A written report<br/>summarizing the alternative plan and results shall be placed in the teacher’s<br/>file.</p>
<p>6.4.7 In the event that the alternative evaluation plan proves to be impractical, it may be</p>
<p>discontinued by mutual consent of the teacher and administrator, and evaluation will revert<br/>to the standard District practice.</p>
<p>6.5 Personnel Files</p>
<p>6.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District personnel file shall be maintained at the District Office.</p>
<p>6.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District personnel file shall contain the evaluation of the unit member’s<br/>performance and any attachments as provided in this Article.</p>

<p>11.2 Verification Procedure</p>
<p>11.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require verification of reasons for the taking or use of any leave if the<br/>District has reason to believe that the absence may not have been used for proper leave<br/>purposes. Such verification in the case of accident or illness leave may include a statement<br/>by a qualified doctor (or practitioner in the case of religious requirement) verifying the cause<br/>and condition of said accident or illness. Abuse of leave privileges may be subject to loss of<br/>pay and appropriate disciplinary action.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illness or Injury Leave</p>
<p>11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every unit member who is regularly employed five (5) days per week is entitled to one (1)<br/>day of paid sick leave for each full month of employment. Unit members who work less<br/>than full time shall be entitled to one (1) day of leave pro-rated as the number of hours they<br/>are employed per week of scheduled duty relates to a full-time employee. Sick leave may be<br/>accumulated and carried over to the following school year without limitation.</p>
<p>11.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require verification by a physician of the District’s choice of any unit<br/>member’s ability to perform his/her responsibilities before returning to work due to an<br/>absence for illness or injury. The examination shall be at no cost to the unit member. The<br/>verification shall be on the appropriate District form.</p>
<p>11.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of emergency illness (or emergency medical or dental appointment, which cannot be<br/>accommodated during off-duty hours, for a maximum of two (2) hours per month, including<br/>travel time) the unit member’s class may be covered voluntarily by other unit members on<br/>their conference periods, and such absence shall not be charged against the unit member’s<br/>sick leave. The site administrator shall be notified in advance of such coverage</p>
<p>11.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members providing voluntary coverage per 11.3.3 do so as a</p>
<p>professional courtesy and will receive no monetary compensation.</p>
<p>11.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members in the bargaining unit whose illness/injury benefits have been consumed and<br/>who must still be absent from duty because of illness or injury shall provide the District with<br/>a statement from a qualified physician (or practitioner, in the case of religious requirement)<br/>which indicates the need for such a leave. In such cases, the unit member shall receive that<br/>amount of pay which is the difference between his/her pay and the amount paid for a<br/>substitute employee, whether or not a substitute is employed, for a total period of five<br/>months per school year, exclusive of accumulated illness or injury leave.

<p>11.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident or Illness Leave</p>
<p>11.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be entitled to industrial accident or illness leave in accordance with the<br/>requirements of the Education Code for personal injury that qualifies the unit member for<br/>Workers’ Compensation benefits.</p>
<p>11.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave for any industrial accident or illness shall not exceed seventy-five (75) days<br/>during which schools of the District are required to be in session or when the unit member<br/>would otherwise be performing work for the District. When any such leave overlaps the<br/>next succeeding year, the unit member shall only be entitled to the unused portion<br/>remaining at the close of the previous year.</p>
<p>11.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the industrial accident or illness leave should extend beyond seventy-five (75) working<br/>days, the unit member may use any other paid leave to which he/she is entitled. After<br/>expiration of paid leave, if a unit member is unable to return to work, as determined by a<br/>licensed physician, he/she may be granted additional leave without pay for the remainder<br/>of the current school year.</p>
<p>11.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to have the unit member examined by a physician designated by<br/>the District to assist in determining the length of time during which the unit member will<br/>temporarily be unable to perform assigned duties and the degree to which the disability is<br/>attributable to the injury involved.</p>
<p>11.10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any days of absence from duty as a result of an accident or illness that qualifies the<br/>unit member for Workers’ Compensation benefits, the unit member shall receive total<br/>compensation, consisting of salary and Workers’ Compensation benefits, not to exceed<br/>100% of the compensation the unit member would have received had the accident or<br/>illness not occurred.</p>
<p>11.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanded Sick Leave (“Kin Care” Leave)</p>
<p>In any calendar year, unit members may use the employee’s accrued and available sick leave<br/>entitlement, in an amount not less than the sick leave that would be accrued during six months at the<br/>employee’s then current rate of entitlement, to attend to an illness of a child, parent, or spouse of the<br/>employee. If the leave qualifies for the Family Medical Leave Act or the California Family Rights<br/>Act protection, the paid sick leave will run concurrently with the leave entitlements offered by the<br/>federal and state laws. (For a full-time unit member working an entire school year, this would<br/>entitle the unit member to use five (5) days of sick leave for “Kin Care” leave.)</p>

<p>11.12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent on a leave of absence without pay shall not count toward salary step<br/>advancement (or employee benefit accrual) and shall not be considered part of the<br/>probationary period.</p>

<p>11.14.5 Selection Procedure</p>
<p>11.14.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sabbatical Leave Committee shall be created and shall be comprised as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>11.14.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) representatives designated by the Superintendent,</p>

<p>11.14.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection Criteria</p>
<p>11.14.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sabbatical leave committee shall establish criteria for the approval or<br/>disapproval of applications for sabbatical leave consistent with this article. In<br/>the event that more than one (1) percent of the unit members apply for and<br/>are found to be qualified for a sabbatical leave, preference shall be given to<br/>those who have not previously been granted a sabbatical leave. If two (2)<br/>applicants are considered substantially equal by the sabbatical leave<br/>committee, then seniority shall be the deciding factor regarding which unit<br/>member will receive a sabbatical leave.</p>

<p>July 1, 2014</p>

<p>Notice of administrative leave will be provided in writing to the unit member placed upon such<br/>leave at the time the leave is to commence. This notice shall be over the signature of the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, and shall include the reason(s) for the leave.</p>
<p>11.16 Catastrophic Leave Program</p>
<p>11.16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Definitions</p>
<p>The Newport-Mesa Unified School District (“District”), the Newport-Mesa Federation<br/>of Teachers (“N-MFT” or “Federation”), the California School Employees Association,<br/>Chapter 18 (“CSEA” or “Association”), the Newport-Mesa Administrators Association<br/>(“N-MAA”), and the Supervisory/Confidential Employee Unit (“S/CEU”) agree to the<br/>establishment of two Catastrophic Leave programs for eligible employees. The intent of<br/>these programs is to provide additional financial protection to those eligible employees<br/>who face a period of prolonged absence from work resulting from a catastrophic illness<br/>or injury. “Catastrophic illness or injury” shall mean illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the employee, spouse, or child (as defined under the current N-MUSD<br/>health benefits plan) which requires the employee to take time off from work on a<br/>continuous or intermittent basis for an extended period of time, and taking time off work<br/>creates a financial hardship for the employee because the employee has exhausted all<br/>sick leave and other paid leave entitlements inclusive of differential pay. (Reference:<br/>California Ed Code 44043.5). The two programs developed in cooperation with the<br/>District, Federation, and Association are the Catastrophic Leave Bank and Individual<br/>Catastrophic Leave Accounts.</p>
<p>11.16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration of the Catastrophic Leave Programs</p>
<p>A Catastrophic Leave Committee (“Committee”) shall administer the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank and the Individual Catastrophic Leave Accounts. The Committee shall have<br/>complete discretion to grant or deny leave requests in whole or in part. The Committee<br/>shall be composed of six (6) members: two (2) from CSEA, two (2) from N-MFT, one</p>
<p>(1) from S/CEU and one (1) N-MAA representative. The Committee will determine and<br/>certify the employee’s eligibility and administer both catastrophic leave programs.<br/>Membership in this Committee will be confidential. The Presidents of each of the units<br/>will select their representatives.</p>
<p>The District’s responsibility includes, but is not limited to, establishing application<br/>procedures and timelines, developing appropriate forms, coordinating the solicitation of<br/>sick days, establishing record keeping procedures, and in coordination with the Payroll<br/>Department, overseeing payment to eligible members. The Human Resources Division<br/>and the employee units will review the Catastrophic Leave Programs annually.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Committee shall be responsible for receiving leave requests,<br/>verifying validity of requests, approving the full or less than full amount requested or<br/>denying requests, communicating its decision to affected eligible employees, the<br/>Superintendent and presidents of each employee organization, and soliciting donations<br/>of sick leave days from eligible employees.</p>
<p>11.16.3 Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>11.16.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation/Eligibility: Employees with more than ten (10) days of<br/>accumulated sick leave and at least one year of service (at least 75% of the<br/>work year) in the District may participate in the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>(“Bank”). Employees who elect to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank may<br/>join the bank only during enrollment periods and must have a waiting period<br/>of thirty (30) calendar days after joining the Bank before becoming eligible to<br/>withdraw from it. Employees returning from an extended leave of absence<br/>shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the first day of returning from leave<br/>to sign up for participation in the Catastrophic Leave Bank if the enrollment<br/>period has expired. Donation to the Bank does not constitute automatic<br/>eligibility for benefits. Use of the Catastrophic Leave Bank must meet the<br/>criteria established herein and approval of the Committee.</p>
<p>11.16.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donation of Days: An eligible employee may elect to participate in the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank by donating at least one (1) day (1 day = current<br/>daily hours assigned) of his/her accumulated sick leave to the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank. The eligible employee shall make this donation by filing an<br/>appropriate district form during the enrollment period. Any donation to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be irrevocable.</p>
<p>11.16.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory Replenishment: Employees who receive contributions from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank must, upon return to duty, commence donations<br/>with a minimum of one (1) accumulated sick leave day per year until total<br/>donations equal the amount of donated leave received from the bank.</p>
<p>11.16.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrollment Procedures: The District shall establish an enrollment period for<br/>eligible employees to participate in the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The<br/>enrollment period shall be initiated for a 30 day period when deemed<br/>necessary by the Committee. Participants will remain eligible for the bank<br/>until the available days in the bank are exhausted. At that time, the<br/>Committee may decide to initiate a new bank. An employee must donate to<br/>the new bank to continue to be eligible to receive benefits from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>11.16.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures to Use/Withdraw Sick Leave - Conditions and Restrictions: In<br/>order to be eligible to withdraw catastrophic leave from the Bank, the eligible<br/>employee must be a participant and have exhausted all of his/her</p>

<p>available/accrued paid leave credits including differential pay, which<br/>includes, but is not limited to, industrial injury leave and sick leave. An<br/>eligible employee who receives paid leave pursuant to this section shall use<br/>any leave credits he or she continues to accrue on a monthly basis prior to<br/>receiving paid leave pursuant to this section.</p>
<p>11.16.3.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eligible employee electing to use the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank shall complete an appropriate form in order to make a<br/>draw on the Bank. The eligible employee must submit this<br/>form to the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, or<br/>designee, for processing. The form will indicate the nature of<br/>the catastrophic illness or injury, probable duration of<br/>absence, and provide the attending physician’s certification<br/>that the illness or injury is of a serious nature requiring<br/>prolonged treatment and preventing the employee from<br/>returning to work. In the event that the eligible employee is<br/>personally unable to apply for the catastrophic leave, an<br/>immediate family member or eligible employee’s agent may<br/>make the request for the applicant.</p>
<p>11.16.3.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may approve withdrawal from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank for up to sixty (60) calendar days.<br/>Requests for additional leave up to the maximum allowable<br/>(12 months) must be submitted to the Committee with an<br/>updated statement from the attending physician. The<br/>employee who receives leave from the Bank shall furnish all<br/>lawfully requested medical information deemed necessary by<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Committee to determine the<br/>employee’s eligibility to receive donated leave from the Bank.</p>
<p>11.16.3.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources and the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Committee shall hold all medical<br/>information in strictest confidence. With permission of the<br/>employee, his/her name may be used to solicit sick days for an<br/>Individual Catastrophic Leave Account (defined below). At<br/>any stage of the application for a Catastrophic Leave benefit or<br/>during an appeal of the Committee decision, an employee may<br/>be assisted by a representative of their respective bargaining<br/>unit with the condition that said representative shall hold all<br/>medical information in strictest confidence.</p>
<p>11.16.3.5.4 The maximum amount of time for which donated leave credits<br/>may be used by an employee shall not exceed a period of<br/>twelve (12) consecutive months. The catastrophic leave<br/>recipient, because he/she remains in paid District status, shall</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>continue to receive District fringe benefit contributions for the<br/>duration of said leave. Failure of the eligible employee to<br/>submit a complete application, including medical information<br/>provided by the applicant’s physician, within twenty (20)<br/>calendar days, would disqualify the eligible employee from<br/>further Catastrophic Leave Bank benefits.</p>
<p>11.16.3.5.5 If there are insufficient days in the Bank, there is no obligation<br/>to grant leave hereunder, in whole or part. Neither the<br/>District, Association, Federation, N-MAA, S/CEU and/or<br/>Committee shall be legally responsible if there are insufficient<br/>days in the Bank to provide benefits through the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank program. The Committee may elect to request<br/>additional donations through additional periods of open<br/>enrollment during the year when appropriate.</p>
<p>11.16.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Payment: When an eligible employee uses a day from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank, pay for that day shall be at the same rate the<br/>eligible employee would have received had he/she worked that day. No<br/>distinction shall be made as to the differing pay rates of the donor and the<br/>recipient.</p>
<p>11.16.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting: By November 15<sup>th</sup> of each year the Payroll Office shall provide<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Committee with a statement detailing the number of<br/>days withdrawn from the Bank during the past year and the number of days<br/>available in the Bank as of the first day of July of the current academic year.</p>
<p>11.16.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of the Catastrophic Leave Bank: By mutual agreement of the<br/>District and collective bargaining agents, the Catastrophic Leave Bank may<br/>be terminated and disposition of the hours remaining in the Bank shall be<br/>negotiated. In the event of a natural disaster or catastrophic event having a<br/>generalized effect, the Superintendent shall retain the right to suspend the<br/>provisions of this article.</p>
<p>In the event one collective bargaining agent wishes to continue a catastrophic<br/>leave bank and the other bargaining unit does not, both units will negotiate a<br/>dissolution agreement. If unsuccessful in reaching a mutually acceptable<br/>agreement, both bargaining units agree to mediation.</p>
<p>11.16.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for a Donation of Donated Sick Leave Non-Grievable: An<br/>employee’s eligibility for or donation of sick leave pursuant to the provisions<br/>of the Catastrophic Leave Bank sections of this Article shall not be subject to<br/>the grievance procedure of the Agreement. It is understood that accepted<br/>donated sick leave is an irrevocable deposit and cannot be rescinded for any<br/>reason.</p>

<p>11.16.4 Individual Catastrophic Leave Accounts:</p>
<p>11.16.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions: In addition to the Catastrophic Leave Bank, the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Committee may authorize solicitations for an Individual Catastrophic<br/>Leave Account to provide extended paid leave benefits to a specific<br/>employee for catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>11.16.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donation of Days: Employees may donate one (1) day if they have a<br/>minimum of ten (10) days accrued after deducting the donation. If an<br/>employee donates sick leave days to another specific employee in a separate<br/>solicitation in an Individual Catastrophic Leave Account, this donation is not<br/>considered for eligibility in the Catastrophic Leave Bank. Any days donated<br/>to an Individual Catastrophic Leave Account should be used prior to use or<br/>exhaustion of the Catastrophic Leave Bank benefits.</p>
<p>Any unused days for the specific employee will be held in an individual<br/>account for a period of five years or until the employee separates from the<br/>District. At that time, any unused days will be transferred to the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank.</p>
<p>11.16.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures to Use/Withdraw Sick Leave - Conditions and Restrictions: The<br/>maximum donation/benefit per incident for any employee through an<br/>Individual Catastrophic Leave Account for his/her own catastrophic illness or<br/>injury will be the number of days defined as one (1) calendar work year for<br/>that employee. Any donations to an Individual Catastrophic Leave Account<br/>that exceed the maximum donation for the affected employee will not be<br/>accepted and the donation submitted returned to the donating employee. This<br/>benefit is extended to each district employee and may be used by each<br/>employee if married spouses are both employees of the District.</p>
<p>11.16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care of Spouse or Child</p>
<p>An employee who qualifies for catastrophic leave to care for a spouse or dependent<br/>child may use a maximum of sixty (60) days of his/her available sick leave. An<br/>employee, if approved by the Catastrophic Leave Committee, may choose to donate up<br/>to sixty (60) days either to care for the spouse or to donate the sixty (60) days to the<br/>spouse if he/she is a district employee. The employee must retain at least ten (10) sick<br/>days for personal use.</p>
<p>11.16.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Procedure</p>
<p>An employee dissatisfied with any action taken or decision made concerning the<br/>catastrophic leave plan may submit a request to the Committee for review of such<br/>action or decision in question. The Committee shall not consider a request for review<br/>unless the request for review is submitted within ten (10) days of notification after the</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>action or decision in question. The Committee shall have no jurisdiction to hear any<br/>request that is not submitted within the required time frame. Following the request, the<br/>appellant has thirty (30) days to submit all relevant paperwork to the Committee. The<br/>Committee shall review the matter under appeal and make its report to the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Human Resources and the N-MFT and CSEA Presidents who may<br/>uphold the decision or direct the Committee to reconsider the request or overturn the<br/>decision with a unanimous vote.</p>
<p>11.16.7 Hold Harmless</p>
<p>An employee who has submitted a request to donate leave, and an employee who has<br/>submitted a request to receive leave under these provisions, shall each execute an<br/>agreement satisfactory to the Committee as a condition of donation or receipt. The<br/>agreement will confirm the understanding of the employee that the donation and receipt<br/>of leave are voluntary. The agreement will also provide that the employee agrees to<br/>release and to hold the Committee, the District, N-MFT, CSEA, N-MAA and S/CEU,<br/>and their respective officers, employees, and agents harmless from any claims,<br/>demands, damages, or causes of action related to the solicitation, application, donation,<br/>receipt, use, grant, or denial of leave, or any appeal thereof, or to the acquisition, use,<br/>disclosure, or maintenance of medical or sick leave information or records under these<br/>provisions.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 12. Salaries</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believing that the key to quality education for the students of the Newport-Mesa Unified School<br/>District begins with a well-qualified teacher, the District and the Federation agree to the goal of<br/>attaining and maintaining teacher salaries between the mean and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile when compared to<br/>salaries of teachers in other unified school districts in Orange County. The goal of N-MFT and the<br/>District is to eventually maintain teacher total compensation at or near the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile based on<br/>an annual comparison to the average of the agreed upon benchmark positions and salary/benefit data<br/>for each Orange County unified school district.</p>
<p>12.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and N-MFT agree that the five benchmark positions that will be used for<br/>comparison will include the regular salary teachers in all Orange County unified districts<br/>would earn who are fully credentialed and who: (a) have a Bachelor’s degree (BA) plus<br/>thirty (30) units past the BA and no years of service credit, (b) have a Bachelor’s degree<br/>(BA) plus forty-five (45) units past the BA and five (5)years of service credit, (c) have a<br/>Bachelor’s degree (BA) plus sixty (60) units past the BA or a Master’s degree and ten (10)<br/>years of service credit, (d) have a Master’s degree plus seventy-five (75) units and fifteen<br/>(15) years of service credit, and finally (e) the maximum salary including all longevity<br/>increments/bonuses. In order to fairly compare these benchmarks between districts, the<br/>daily rates for each benchmark position will be calculated and then averaged to create one<br/>number per district that will be used to calculate rank and percentile point variance from the<br/>mean and from the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective 7/1/14, the parties agree to a 6% adjustment to the compensation package provided to<br/>certificated non-management employees as reflected in Appendix A. The salary schedules in<br/>Appendix A will be increased for 2014-2015.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to potential economic uncertainty, the District reserves its right to initiate negotiations under<br/>the State’s collective bargaining laws. Government Code section 3540, to negotiate work year,<br/>compensation, benefits and other cost-containment matters for the duration of this agreement. In the<br/>event the District is faced with budget cuts, written notice shall be provided to the Federation.<br/>Negotiations under this provision of the agreement may commence ten (10) days after receipt of<br/>notification of loss of revenue. The provisions to negotiate cuts under 12.3 of this agreement shall<br/>cease on June 30, 2017.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have an earned doctorate in education or a related field will receive an ongoing<br/>4% stipend of the annual salary schedule amount.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who receive one or more National Board certifications from the National Board for<br/>Professional Teaching Standards will receive an ongoing 2% stipend of the annual salary schedule<br/>amount.</p>
<p>12.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologists with National Board certification in teaching, psychology or behavioral<br/>analysis will receive an ongoing 2% stipend of the annual salary schedule amount.</p>

<p>Upon initial employment for all unit members hired after July 1, 2000, credit for service<br/>outside the District shall be allowed on the salary schedule at the rate of one (1) year for<br/>each year of service equivalent to 75% or more of a contract year of school employment<br/>in an accredited institution while serving under a preliminary or professional clear<br/>credential up to a maximum of 13 years.</p>
<p>12.6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon initial employment of a nurse, credit for service outside the District<br/>shall be allowed on the salary schedule at the rate of one (1) year for each<br/>year of service equivalent to 75% or more of a contract year of employment<br/>as a credentialed school nurse and/or service as a licensed RN up to the<br/>maximum allowed in 12.6.1 above.</p>

<p>12.12 Role and Recompense - Believing that extracurricular activities are a part of a student’s well-<br/>rounded education, the District and Federation agree to use Role and Recompense funds to<br/>compensate bargaining unit members who support those activities. Realizing that Role and<br/>Recompense can never adequately compensate unit members for their efforts in these areas, the</p>
<p>July 1. 2014</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>Role and Recompense program provides compensation for extra responsibility and work primarily<br/>outside of the regular school day. For the purposes of this article, compensation for non-bargaining<br/>unit members will be on the same basis as unit members.</p>
<p>12.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in 2007-08 the value of a Role and Recompense Unit established as 1.00% of<br/>the cell identified as Column A, Step 1 on the Teacher Salary Schedule (186 days) for the<br/>respective year of this Agreement. The value of the Unit will be rounded to the nearest<br/>whole dollar. The value of the Unit will be commensurately adjusted to match any future<br/>adjustment to the salary schedule which may be affected by the implementation of Article</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>12.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide flexibility in implementing Role and Recompense, schools may use the<br/>District - Federation Restructuring Trust Agreement to request waivers for sections of<br/>this collective bargaining agreement. Among the types of flexibility offered are the<br/>following:</p>
<p>12.12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reallocate unused stipends to fund other school-specific positions. For<br/>example, if one school does not have a character education position, that<br/>stipend can fund another position such as math family night coordinator.</p>
<p>12.12.2.1.1 The following stipends are only available on an elementary<br/>campus if applicable to that school’s grade level<br/>configuration:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level chair positions 1 through 6</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoor Science/Outdoor School</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science Fair</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Council</p>
<p>12.12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reallocate the dollar amount within a classification of stipends. For<br/>example, divide the stipends for four (4) varsity football positions, and fund<br/>eight (8) football coaches.</p>
<p>12.12.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augment one stipend by taking a portion of the money from another stipend<br/>or flex unit.</p>
<p>12.12.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset June 30, 2015: However, any stipends or flex units that have not been<br/>allocated for use by April 1<sup>st</sup> of the current school year shall not be available<br/>and shall go back to the District general fund.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2015: funds that are not allocated in the approved R and R<br/>plan will be returned to the general fund.</p>
<p>12.12.3 A site-based Role and Recompense Committee will collaborate with the principal to<br/>implement the Role and Recompense program at each school. The Role and</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Recompense Committee will be composed of democratically elected teachers who<br/>represent the various grade levels, curricular areas, and sports/activity programs at the<br/>school. The Role and Recompense Committee is responsible for the following:</p>
<p>12.12.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet with the principal or designee to determine the needs of the school<br/>based on district and school goals. Effective July 1, 2015: distribute the<br/>proposed R and R plan to the faculty at least 5 days prior to site approval to<br/>provide staff an opportunity for input.</p>
<p>12.12.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine the positions to be offered by flex units for each school.</p>
<p>12.12.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish a selection process for Role and Recompense positions within the<br/>guidelines established within the Human Resources Department i.e. open<br/>positions must be posted and the selection process follow District and legal<br/>requirements.</p>
<p>12.12.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset June 30, 2015: Obtain waivers for any exceptions to the Role and<br/>Recompense section of the contract, including writing job descriptions for<br/>school-specific positions.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2015: Write job descriptions for school specific positions</p>
<p>12.12.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitor that requirements are met by Role and Recompense stipend<br/>recipients, with input from the site principal.</p>
<p>12.12.3.6 Reconvene prior to the end of school year (May or June) in order to<br/>recommend R &amp; R plan for the upcoming school year.</p>
<p>12.13 Summer School</p>
<p>12.13.1 Unit members employed for an entire Summer Session shall receive a contract</p>
<p>based on the hourly schedule below. Upon ratification of this contract, these rates<br/>will increased by the same percent salary increase certificated salaries increased<br/>on a year-to-year basis. Exceptions to the contract days/hours shall be prorated on<br/>the summer school schedule.</p>

The Committee also recommends the amount of the District contribution and the<br/>amount of the employee contribution to fund the benefit packages.</p>
<p>13.1.1 Special Provisions for 2014-15 Benefit Information Meetings - Joint Benefits Team:</p>
<p>The “Employee Benefits Committee’ will not meet in 2014-15. The Bargaining Units will<br/>be invited to send 4 members each from the negotiating teams to join one each of the<br/>Newport-Mesa Administrators Association, confidential employees, supervisors, and<br/>District management to discuss benefit information. References in this Article to the<br/>“Employee Benefits Committee” will refer to the “Joint Benefits Team” in this special<br/>provision. Negotiations related to benefit plans will occur separately with the bargaining<br/>units. This provision will continue going forward as the status quo unless a change is<br/>negotiated by the parties.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>a. ) “Benefits Cap” defined as the average FTE allocation required for Benefits Package<br/>coverage paid July through September at prior fiscal year Composite Rate for all coverages and<br/>costs October through June at current fiscal year Composite Rate.</p>
<p>b. ) “Benefits Package” defined as medical, dental, vision, life, EAP (Employee Assistance<br/>Program) and administrative costs for coverage provided to employees and retirees as recommended<br/>by the Benefits Committee and adopted by N-MFT.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Records shall be furnished to the Committee as required by benefit providers and District personnel<br/>charged with administering the health and welfare plan.</p>
<p>A consultant/broker or other support staff may be authorized by the Committee within the budget<br/>“cap.”</p>
<p>A fund will be established for separate accounting of medical benefits. The District will deposit an<br/>amount annually equal to the negotiated cap for eligible full-time employees and the prorated<br/>amount for each eligible part-time employee. “All employees” is defined as all eligible employees<br/>even if he/she waives the right to receive medical benefits. Also deposited in this fund will be<br/>employee contributions toward benefits and monies returned from Section 125 plans. No<br/>expenditures involving monies within the District cap will be expended without authorization of the<br/>Committee, with the exception of ongoing monthly premiums as approved by the Committee to<br/>current vendors.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Expenditures from the fund will be limited to the following: premiums to providers, committee<br/>approved itemized costs from the District and/or any consultant hired by the Employee Benefit<br/>Committee to administer the benefits and/or advise the Committee, and any other expenditures<br/>authorized by the Committee.

<p>13.3 District Funded Health and Welfare Benefit Cap and Employee Contributions</p>
<p>Commencing insurance year 2014-15, the District funded Health and Welfare Benefit Unit Cap<br/>(Benefit Cap) shall be a maximum of up to $15,309.00.</p>

<p>2014-15 Employee Over Cap Benefit Contribution</p>
<p>There will still be a residual dollar amount required to fund the total cost of 2014-15 employee<br/>benefits beyond the 2014-15 District funded Benefit Cap. This additional residual amount will be<br/>paid by each employee with benefits on a tenthly basis via payroll deduction.</p>
<p>All NMFT bargaining unit members with benefits will pay the applicable O-Cap (Employee Over<br/>Cap Benefit Contribution) based on the following table:</p>

<p>Full time employees who elect to opt-out of medical and retain CIGNA Dental Plan and/or YSP<br/>Vision Plan will pay only the $36.70 over-cap tenthly or the prorated amount for part-time<br/>employees. The over-cap calculator and Employee Benefit Deduction Table are available at<br/><a href="http://www.nmusd.us/benefits">www.nmusd.us/benefits</a>.</p>
<p>Scope of Benefits</p>
<p>A change to the scope of the Health and Welfare Benefits is subject to negotiations. The Health and<br/>Welfare benefits provided by the District to active employees and early retirees qualifying under<br/>Article 16 include medical insurance, dental, vision and life insurance, taking into consideration<br/>recommendations made by the Employee Benefits Committee. As noted, changes to any of these<br/>benefit plans are subject to negotiations between the Federation and District, taking into<br/>consideration recommendations made by the Employee Benefits Committee.</p>
<p>If the funded Health and Welfare Benefit Unit Cap is insufficient to cover the full cost of benefits as<br/>established by the Employee Benefit Committee then plan modifications to reduce the coverage<br/>profile cost to an amount within the funded cap may be made by the Employee Benefits Committee<br/>and adopted by NMFT. If plan modifications are not made or not adopted then effective for the first<br/>premium payment the residual dollar amount required beyond the funded cap shall be made by<br/>employee contribution paid through employee payroll deduction on a tenthly basis.</p>
<p>13.3.1 Health and Welfare Plan Changes 2015-16</p>
<p>All employee groups are currently in the same Health and Welfare benefit plan insurance<br/>pool and have a mutual interest in the fiscal health of the benefit programs.</p>
<p>13.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan change effective 7/1/15 for the 2015-16 Benefit Year</p>
<p>The District and NMFT have fully negotiated the end of the Point of Service plan<br/>at the conclusion of the 2014-15 Benefit Year.</p>
<p>13.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of Benefit Plan for 2015-16</p>
<p>The District and NMFT will explore benefit plan options for 2015-16 and by no<br/>later than March 1, 2015 will provide an update on the status of the review to<br/>NMFT bargaining unit employees. By no later than May 15, 2015, the District<br/>and NMFT will agree (i.e. benefit plan only MOU or Tentative Agreement) on<br/>the alternative plan(s) to present to the NMFT bargaining unit for ratification<br/>vote which must begin no later than June 1, 2015.</p>
<p>Prior to a ratification vote on plan change(s) as required by this section, the<br/>District will provide factual information about benefit plan changes at a<br/>minimum of 4 zone meetings. The District will schedule and NMFT will<br/>participate in the informational meetings. The District and NMFT will make a</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>good faith effort to conduct a fair ratification vote based on the facts/provisions<br/>of the benefit plan option(s).</p>
<p>The 1) ratification by the simple majority of the NMFT bargaining unit members<br/>voting in the ratification election and 2) approval by the Board of Education are<br/>required to change the Health and Welfare Benefit plan. (Agreement from other<br/>bargaining unit may also be required.)</p>
<p>13.3.1.3 If NMFT fails to have a fully executed agreement for an alternative plan by</p>
<p>June 23, 2015, the District will determine the default medical plan for 2015-16<br/>after a final consultation with NMFT. The District will also consider<br/>recommendations by the Joint Benefits Team if available. No further negotiation<br/>is required with NMFT to proceed with the new plan design for the 2015-16<br/>benefit plan.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any cost of medical benefits for dependents, shall be deducted from the unit member’s paycheck<br/>upon authorization by the unit member.</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available Health Plans</p>
<p>The available health and welfare benefits are determined by the scope of benefits provided under<br/>section 13.3.</p>
<p>13.5.1 Active Members - Premium Payment</p>
<p>The scope of benefits and premium payments are provided in accordance with Section 13.3.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time employees will pay no premium deductions for the POS Service Plus plan<br/>for themselves or eligible dependents. The POS plan will end at the conclusion of the<br/>2014-15 medical plan year and an alternative plan design will be determined per</p>
<p>13.3.1.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time employees will pay no premium deduction for the Dental (HMO) plan for<br/>themselves or eligible dependents. An additional premium charge will be paid by<br/>those employees selecting Dental (PPO).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dual Benefit Coverage Eligibility: When two N-MUSD employees are married to<br/>each other or when domestic partners are both employees of the district, they become<br/>eligible for Dual Benefit Coverage.</p>
<p>Dual Benefit Coverage: When spouses/domestic partners are eligible and enrolled<br/>for Dual Benefit Coverage, the employees will be responsible for all co-pays<br/>required under the plan. However, there are no out-of-pocket expenses under the in-<br/>network PPO plan. For example: Under the in-network PPO plan (80%/20%<br/>coverage), employees would not be responsible for the 20% contribution. Under out-</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>of-network coverage, employees will be responsible for services charged above the<br/>usual and customary fees. For example: Under the out-of-network coverage<br/>(60%/40% coverage), employees will not be responsible for the 40% contribution<br/>within the usual and customary fees. The employees will not be charged a monthly<br/>premium for PPO dental coverage and this coverage will not include a coordination<br/>of benefits. Vision coverage will include a coordination of benefits between each<br/>employee. Both employees are required to pay the employee over cap premium<br/>contributions through payroll deductions.</p>
<p>Dual Spouse Coverage Declination: Both spouses/domestic partners may complete<br/>the Dual Spouse Coverage Declination form to waive the Dual Benefit coverage<br/>referenced above. The declination form requires one employee to decline their<br/>medical, dental and vision benefit and one employee to enroll as a primary subscriber<br/>with the other employee as a dependent. Benefit coverage will include all coverage<br/>available for an active, health benefit eligible employee, but not dual coverage. Only<br/>the primary subscriber will be responsible for the over cap employee premium<br/>contribution.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time employees will pay no premium deductions for the vision plan for<br/>themselves and their eligible dependents.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide at no cost to the employee term life insurance in the amount<br/>of $50,000 for full-time employees and $25,000 for part-time employees.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide at no cost to the employee an Employee Assistance<br/>Program.</p>
<p>13.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees eligible for health and welfare benefits who are in paid status through the last<br/>day of their regular K-12 student school year shall have the health and welfare benefits<br/>under this article effective through the last day of September of the succeeding school year.<br/>Employees eligible for the health and welfare benefits who terminate their employment prior<br/>to the close of the school year shall have their benefits continue through the last day of the<br/>month in which their termination occurs. Life insurance benefits shall terminate at the same<br/>time as other group health benefits following an employee’s termination.</p>
<p>13.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who were employed after the first day of the school year shall have all benefits<br/>of this article commence on the first day of the month following their first day of<br/>employment.</p>
<p>13.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Retirees - Premium Payments for Retirees meeting the eligibility requirements of<br/>Article 16 are designated as “early retirees.”</p>
<p>Early retirees shall have the same “scope of benefits” as actives, except the District will<br/>provide at no cost to retirees, term life insurance in the amount of $10,000 until they reach<br/>age 65.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>If both spouses are eligible retirees in the District, they shall also be eligible for dual Benefit<br/>Coverage as provided to actives.</p>
<p>Early retirees who have retired on or before June 30, 2011 will pay no over-the-cap<br/>employee contributions until they reach age 65.</p>
<p>For early retirees who retire on or after July 1, 2011, early retirees will be subject to and will<br/>pay the same over-the-cap employee contributions as actives under Article 13.3. (Note: as a<br/>result Article 16 at section 16.2.1.1 regarding “no premium cost” shall apply only to those<br/>retirees who retired on or before June 30, 2011. Early retirees retiring on or after July 1,</p>
<p>2011 will be subject to and will pay the same over-the-cap employee contributions as actives<br/>under Article 13.3).</p>
<p>A. An additional premium charge will be paid by early retirees selecting Cigna Dental<br/>(PPO).</p>
<p>13.5.5 Retirees no longer eligible for District insurance under Article 16 may purchase medical and<br/>dental insurance under the District group plan. Cost of the insurance is the sole<br/>responsibility of the retiree.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member employed after April 1,1977, who works less than full-time for fifty percent<br/>(50%) or more of a full-time contract, shall receive a prorated fringe benefit contribution from the<br/>district in proportion to the number of hours per week or days per month of scheduled duty worked.</p>

Any pro-rata contribution for health and dental<br/>benefits in effect at the time of death of the employee shall become the responsibility of the<br/>dependent(s) for continued coverage.</p>
<p>13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are on a Board approved unpaid leave of absence shall have the option to<br/>continue to participate in the District health and welfare benefit program for a maximum of three (3)<br/>years at no cost to the District.

<p>ARTICLE 21. Savings Provision</p>
<p>21.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provisions of this agreement are held to be contrary to law by the Public Employment<br/>Relations Board or a court of competent jurisdiction, such provisions shall not be deemed valid and<br/>subsisting except to the extent permitted by law, but all other provisions shall continue in full force<br/>and effect.</p>
<p>21.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation and the District shall meet to renegotiate said provisions within thirty (30) calendar<br/>days.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 22. Completion of Meet and Negotiate</p>
<p>This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. All matters not specifically<br/>enumerated within the provisions of this contract are expressly reserved to the District.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>ARTICLE 23. No Child Left Behind (NCLB)</p>
<p>23.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties acknowledge that the Federal Government enacted No Child Left Behind to establish<br/>and enforce standards of performance for schools. NCLB requires Districts to provide assistance to<br/>schools that fail to meet their Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) after several successive years, and<br/>to impose increasingly restrictive sanctions when schools continue not to meet AYP after four years<br/>of testing. The parties further acknowledge that NCLB creates a shared interest between the District<br/>and the Federation to adhere to NCLB precepts in order to preserve Title 1 Federal funding to the<br/>District. While NCLB requires the Local Education Agency (District) to enact at least one of the<br/>sanctions listed in the law, it also makes clear that imposition of the sanction must conform to the<br/>procedures negotiated and written into the collective bargaining agreement. Article 23 establishes<br/>the agreed-upon procedures, parties, and timelines that will be used to comply with the No Child<br/>Left Behind Act. Article 23 exists solely to address the requirements established by NCLB. Should<br/>changes to NCLB occur at either Federal or State level, parties agree to review this article as it<br/>relates to those changes. In the event NCLB ceases to exist as a Federal or State mandate, this<br/>article and the accompanying appendices will become null and void.</p>
<p>23.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and N-MFT recognize that schools unable to meet AYP targets after three years of<br/>working on their own need assistance from outside the school. This assistance will be provided by<br/>the “NCLB Hearing Panel” (as outlined below) beginning in the Program Improvement Year 3<br/>status. The NCLB Hearing Panel is established by the criteria below. This panel shall be a standing<br/>committee that will meet throughout the year as needed.</p>
<p>23.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The membership of the NCLB Hearing Panel shall be as follows:</p>
<p>23.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two union representatives appointed by N-MFT, at least one of whom shall have<br/>Title I experience, to serve a minimum of two years.</p>
<p>23.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two District representatives appointed by the District, at least one of whom shall be,<br/>or have been, a Principal with Title 1 experience, to serve a minimum of two years.</p>
<p>23.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Classified representative appointed by CSEA to serve a minimum of one year.</p>
<p>23.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One community representative appointed by the Harbor Council PTA, to serve a<br/>minimum of one year.</p>
<p>23.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One consultant with relevant expertise appointed jointly by the N-MFT and District<br/>representatives, to serve a term to be determined.</p>
<p>23.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel will establish a chairperson who must be a representative of either the N-<br/>MFT or the District, and the position of chairperson will rotate between the two<br/>organizations on a two-year cycle.</p>
<p>23.3.6.1 Vacancies will be filled by the respective constituency to complete<br/>the existing term only.</p>

<p>23.4.3</p></td><td>
<p>For “Corrective Action” P.I. - 3 (Program Improvement 3) {see Appendix 2 for<br/>chart} the NCLB Hearing Panel will have the responsibility to investigate the<br/>school’s situation, consider the sanctions written into the NCLB law, decide what<br/>action is necessary to sufficiently improve the education program based on the<br/>finding of facts, and write a final report that includes a rationale explaining (a) the<br/>interventions that will be continued and/or (b) any new recommended interventions<br/>(at least one of which must be NCLB sanctioned as described in 23.1).</p></td></tr>

The panel will again submit a written final report, and the same standard as<br/>described in 23.4.5 will apply to the Board for review.</p>
<p>23.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Restructuring”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.I.-5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCLB Hearing Panel will follow</p>
<p>the same investigative process outlined in 23.4.5, but submit their report to the<br/>Superintendent’s Cabinet, who will take over as the decision-making entity that<br/>recommends action to the Board. The cabinet will consider the sanctions written<br/>into the NCLB text and recommend to the Board such action as deemed necessary to<br/>sufficiently improve the education program while meeting all the contractual<br/>requirements in Articles 1-22 of this collective bargaining agreement and in<br/>compliance with Section 116(d) of the NCLB law.</p>
<p>23.5 Decision Making Process</p>
<p>23.5.1 The Hearing Panel will operate in a collaborative manner and use a consensus</p>
<p>decision-making model. If consensus cannot be reached, the panel will decide by a<br/>majority vote. Each of the panel has one vote. (NMFT = two votes, District = two<br/>votes, CSEA = one vote, Harbor Council PTA = one vote, Consultant= one vote,<br/>which equals a total of seven votes).</p>
<p>July 1. 2014</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>Appendix 1<br/>Timeline</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximate timelines for testing, return of results and determination of meeting AYP:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing occurs during March, April and May each school year.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing configurations are different for elementary, middle &amp; high school.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results and determination of whether or not a school has met its AYP Annual Measurable<br/>Objectives (AMOs) are made and announced by the state in late August or early September<br/>as school begins. Sometimes a time period is required for data correction, and public release<br/>of the results may be delayed as late as January of the following year.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to meet the AYP Annual Measurable Objectives advances a school toward, or<br/>establishes a school in Program Improvement status.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inability to meet AYP Annual Measurable Objectives in successive years:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First inability to meet AYP at September notification, the school is “on watch” for that<br/>ensuing school year.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second inability to meet AYP in the same content area or the same indicator at September<br/>notification, the school enters Program Improvement Year 1 for that ensuing school year.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third inability to meet AYP at September notification, the school enters Program<br/>Improvement Year 2 for that ensuing school year following California Department of<br/>Education guidelines. The District provides technical assistance and supplemental<br/>education services as prescribed in the law (i.e. consultants or after school programs).</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth inability to meet AYP at September notification, the school enters Program<br/>Improvement Year 3 for that ensuing year. This is a “Corrective Action” year and is the first<br/>year in which the District is required to implement at least one of the six options listed in<br/>NCLB. (see 23.4.2).</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth inability to meet AYP at September notification, the school enters Program<br/>Improvement Year 4 for that ensuing year. This year is identified in the law as<br/>“Restructuring” and is the second year in which the District is required to implement at least<br/>one of the five options listed in the law.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, and all subsequent years of not meeting AYP at September notification, the school<br/>enters Program Improvement Year 5 for that ensuing year. This status is “Restructuring”<br/>and brings the school closer to outside intervention for the school and/or the District (see</p>
<p>23.4.5).</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>g) Schools must meet their AYP Annual Measurable Objective for two successive years in<br/>order to exit Program Improvement status.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that schools are equipped to rectify their own achievement problems in the<br/>pre-Program Improvement years and in Program Improvement Years 1 and 2. School leadership<br/>teams will review test data, examine the school’s instructional program, and make changes that will<br/>improve the instructional program leading to increased student achievement and exit from Program<br/>Improvement status.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide appropriate technical expertise and supplemental educational services<br/>during this time of early intervention, based on the site’s assessment data, findings, plans for<br/>improvement, and requests for assistance.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the responsibility of the panel to:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collect data about teachers, administrators and school performance;</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determine the finding of facts;</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consult with the Assistant Superintendent of Business to determine the fiscal viability of any<br/>interventions or recommendations being considered;</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write draft recommendations;</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide for an appeal hearing after presenting the draft recommendations;</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make a final decision and write a final report.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members will receive training provided by the District that the panel determines necessary to<br/>carry out the responsibilities outlined in this article.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommended timeline for the NCLB Hearing Panel:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel receives test data in late August or early September; as early as possible for initial<br/>review work.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel begins active investigation by the end of September</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel writes and presents a draft report by the end of October</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel holds public appeal hearings by the end of October</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel issues a final report and order for action by the end of November.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Appendix 2<br/>Glossary of Terms</p>
<p>Assessment Data:</p>
<p>Assessment Data is testing data that is obtained from a combination of qualitative and quantitative multiple<br/>measures including: Standardized test Data, local benchmark test data. District Multiple measures,<br/>classroom data, portfolios, etc.</p>
<p>Qualitative Data:</p>
<p>Qualitative data is information gathered by the teacher, administrator, or other, observation, note-taking,<br/>narratives, interviews, etc.</p>
<p>Quantitative Data:</p>
<p>Quantitative data is statistical information, numerical data, percentages, that data can be counted.</p>
<p>Technical Assistance;</p>
<p>Technical Assistance is District assistance to a site as well as the statewide system of support for Title I<br/>Program Improvement schools and local educational agencies.</p>
<p>Supplemental Educational Services: (SES)</p>
<p>Supplemental educational services are tutoring or other supplemental academic enrichment activities<br/>beyond the regular school day. Services are to be high quality, research-based and designed to improve the<br/>students’ academic achievement. Students are eligible for services if they are in Title I schools and (1) not<br/>meeting State Board of Education content standards in reading and math and (2) from low-income families.</p>
<p>AYP: Adequate Yearly Progress:</p>
<p>The Academic Performance Index (API) is the cornerstone of California’s Public Schools Accountability<br/>Act of 1999 (PSAA). The purpose of the API is to measure the academic performance and growth of<br/>schools. It is a numeric index (or scale) that ranges from a low of 200 to a high of 1000. A school’s score<br/>on the API is an indicator of a school’s performance level. The statewide API performance target for all<br/>schools is 800. A school’s growth is measured by how well it is moving toward or past that goal. A<br/>school’s base year API is subtracted from its growth API to determine how much the school improved in a<br/>year.</p>
<p>AMP’s: Annual Measurable Objectives:</p>
<p>To make AYP a school must demonstrate that a minimum percentage of students score proficient or above<br/>on a Standards Based Assessment in English Language Arts and Mathematics. These percentages are<br/>called Annual Measurable Objectives (AMO’s). The annual percentages must be met or the schools that</p>
<p>July 1. 2014</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>receive Title I funding will be considered for Program Improvement Status. This includes the school as a<br/>whole and all significant subgroups.</p>
<p>Program Improvement:</p>
<p>(From <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov">www.cde.ca.gov</a> - Testing and Accountability)</p>
<p>A Title I School wide Program (SWP) school will be identified for Program Improvement when, for each<br/>of two consecutive years, the Title I SWP school does not make AYP in the same content area (English-<br/>language arts or mathematics) school wide or for any numerically significant subgroup, or on the same<br/>indicator (Academic Performance Index or high school graduation rate) school wide.</p>
<p>A Title I Local Educational Agency (LEA) will be identified for Program Improvement when, for each of<br/>two consecutive years, the Title I LEA does not make AYP and does not make the LEA-wide Academic<br/>Performance Index threshold for the socioeconomically disadvantaged student subgroup.</p>
<p>Entering Program Improvement:</p>
<p>A school or LEA that does not meet specific indicators described above for two consecutive years will<br/>enter Program Improvement.</p>
<p>Advancing in Program Improvement:</p>
<p>A school that was in Program Improvement the previous year and does not meet the specific indicators<br/>described above for the new year, will advance to the next level of Program Improvement and will be<br/>required to implement the applicable NCLB requirements.</p>
<p>Maintaining Program Improvement Status:</p>
<p>A school that was in Program Improvement during the precious year and meets the specific indicators<br/>described above the next year, will not advance in Program Improvement, but will maintain the same<br/>Program Improvement status for the new year. This school will be required to continue implementing the<br/>applicable NCLB requirements.</p>
<p>Exiting from Program Improvement:</p>
<p>A school in Program Improvement that meets the specific indicators described above for two consecutive<br/>years will exit from Program Improvement that next year. An LEA may exit Program Improvement if it<br/>meets AYP for two consecutive years.</p>

<p>ROLE AND RECOMPENSE</p>
<p>The joint District/Union Role and Recompense Committee realize that role and<br/>recompense could never adequately compensate unit members for their efforts expended<br/>on behalf of the total educational program. Role and Recompense compensates unit<br/>members for their efforts expended on behalf of the total educational program by<br/>accepting responsibilities that are primarily beyond their regular assigned duties.</p>

<p>TRUST AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The Newport-Mesa Unified School District and the Newport-Mesa Federation of Teachers enter into this<br/>agreement (see attached Guidelines for Restructuring). Either party may terminate the agreement upon<br/>twelve months notice.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>Newport Mesa Unified School District/Newport-Mesa Federation of Teachers<br/>GUIDELINES FOR RESTRUCTURING</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The Newport-Mesa Unified School District and the Newport-Mesa Federation of Teachers agree that by<br/>working together we can exert a powerful and positive influence on the continued improvement of<br/>learning outcomes for all N-MUSD students.</p>
<p>We recognize that the most important interactions affecting student performance are those between<br/>teachers and students. Increased student achievement and teacher professionalism will occur as<br/>responsibility and accountability for success are assumed by school sites. Through shared decision¬<br/>making, those who have the most direct contact with students can collaborate in developing school-based<br/>solutions designed to increase the probability of improved student learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Shared decision-making is an integral part of the process of improving student learning outcomes. The<br/>District will not impose any single model for shared decision-making, but will encourage each school<br/>staff engaged in restructuring the teaching/leaming process to adopt a model that meets the needs of the<br/>group.</p>
<p>Significant school change requires leadership, collaboration between/among school and district staff,<br/>sufficient time to develop an understanding of the process, ongoing commitment to planning and<br/>implementation, and evaluation of effects. Change occurs as a developmental process and therefore new<br/>structures will evolve and undergo modifications based on the participants’ experience.</p>
<p>The opportunity to participate in restructuring will be available to all schools, and within each school to<br/>all who share responsibility for student learning outcomes. Restructuring schools will operate within the<br/>guidelines of the Education Code, District policy provisions, and requirements of the Union contract,<br/>except where specific provisions are waived using procedures outlined herein.</p>
<p>Ultimate success is dependent upon the commitment and participation of teachers, site administrators, N-<br/>MFT leadership, the Superintendent, central office staff, students, parents and community members as<br/>well as upon the support of the Board of Education.</p>
<p>Guiding Principles for Restructuring and Shared Decision-Making</p>
<p>Restructuring is defined here as the collaborative re-design of a school’s teaching/leaming processes with<br/>the intent to improve student outcomes. Restructuring in Newport-Mesa will be guided by the following<br/>principles:</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Union share a responsibility to create and sustain a climate which encourages<br/>innovation and permits restructuring to occur.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring will occur voluntarily at a school site with the understanding and support of the school’s<br/>faculty and the site administrator.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Union recognize the concept of uniqueness in site restructuring. Since<br/>differences exist among various school communities, plans for restructuring the teaching/learning<br/>process may differ from site to site.</p>
<p>July 1, 2014</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to the current literature on multiple dimensions of restructuring (e g. shared decision¬<br/>making, recent findings of cognitive psychology and their impact on instructional theory, new<br/>instructional approaches specific to particular content areas.)</p>
<p>Shared Decision-Making</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve as a clearinghouse to link schools with resources (consultants, observation<br/>sites, materials) to support restructuring.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training in site-based shared decision-making to insure an open and accessible<br/>process, including procedures for group problem-solving and reaching consensus.</p>
<p>Restructuring Teaching/Learning Process</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance with development of restructuring plans for specific sites.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance in developing a site-based accountability system which will provide information for<br/>monitoring (1) the shared decision-making process, (2) the school’s progress in reaching its goals,</p>
<p>(3) the impact of restructuring on student learning and performance, and (4) the impact of<br/>restructuring on parent and community perceptions of the school.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing waiver applications, through which school staffs may apply for relief from specific<br/>sections of the collective bargaining agreement, district policy/practice, and/or state law where<br/>justified to promote increased student learning outcomes.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for individuals in the district who wish to prepare themselves for the role of group<br/>facilitator.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance with resolution of other issues which may arise.</p>
<p>Procedures for Obtaining Waivers</p>
<p>Because restructuring schools creates organizational structures that support risk-taking and innovation,<br/>it often requires that external and internal controls—laws and regulations, policies and bargaining<br/>agreements—be modified or waived to allow new solutions to be tested.</p>
<p>School staffs in restructuring schools may apply for relief from specific provisions of District policies,<br/>regulations, or practices, the collective bargaining agreement, or state law when in the opinion of the<br/>school staff those provisions constrain their ability to restructure the teaching/learning process for the<br/>benefit of children.</p>
<p>A school staff may apply for a waiver after thorough discussion of the issues involved and adequate<br/>time for reflection. The waiver application shall only become valid after a certifiable positive vote (by<br/>secret ballot) of two-thirds of the eligible certificated staff who vote. Eligible staff is defined as those<br/>who are bargaining unit members employed in paid status and assigned at the affected site at the time<br/>of the vote.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>Contract Language Outlines the followin2 process:</p>
<p>3.2.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the faculty or administration may schedule open discussions to probe the need<br/>for, and value in, changing the configuration of instructional minutes. In order to facilitate incremental<br/>change, the discussion and voting process may be done as many times in succession during the school<br/>year as a site desires. The discussions may lead to a definite, single new alternative configuration that<br/>will (a) be cleared by Nutrition Services, Transportation and Fiscal departments, (b) be presented to the<br/>faculty for continued discussion, (c) be held for a wait and reflection period of at least five (5) school<br/>days, and (d) be subject to a waiver vote against the existing configuration of instructional minutes (as<br/>outlined in Appendix D). If the alternative receives 2/3 support of the total eligible certificated staff, it<br/>will be submitted to the JCCR on a completed district waiver application. If not, the existing<br/>configuration of instructional minutes will continue.</p>
<p>3.2.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JCCR will review the application and may recommend the waiver for approval to<br/>the Board of Education for implementation. For waivers to be implemented in the fall of the following<br/>year, the school must submit the completed district waiver application to the JCCR by May 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
