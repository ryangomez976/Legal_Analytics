<p>ARTICLE XIV<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURE</p>
<p>14.1 Evaluations</p>
<p>During the 2013-2014 school year, the Professional Development Committee<br/>completed a review and established the incorporation of student achievement<br/>and progress toward District -adopted and State-adopted standards, including<br/>the State-mandated California Standard Test CST program and its annual<br/>reported test results. District-adopted formative assessment (Measure of<br/>Academic Progress), and also to any future criterion-referenced State-mandated<br/>replacements or additions thereto.</p>
<p>As determined by the Professional Development Committee, for the 2014-15<br/>school year, the following State Assessments, in addition to others, may be used<br/>for this purpose:</p>

<p>Quantitative Assessment to Measure Pupil Progress (Secondary)</p>
<p>While established statewide testing will be used for some subject areas to measure student achievement, each teacher will be<br/>responsible for active collaboration with their grade level or department in the development and implementation of a calibrated<br/>benchmark assessment that will determine student progress. Quantitative data will be reviewed by the teacher and administrator in<br/>the spirit of discussing teaching practice and improving student achievement. Teachers will review and update assessments each year,<br/>and continue to professionally develop to increase student feedback.</p></td></tr>

<p>The CAASPP system will eventually provide “interim” assessments, but these tests will<br/>not provide data for student growth. These proposed interim assessments, provided by<br/>SBAC will only provide an item bank of questions teachers can use as an instructional<br/>support. As such, MAP will continue to be implemented as CUSD’s formative<br/>assessment, even after CAASPP is in place for 2014-15. MAP testing windows continue<br/>to be evaluated. At this writing, testing windows are to be determined for 14-15 and<br/>beyond.</p>
<p>Results of student and parent feedback annual surveys developed by the Professional<br/>Development committee will be accessed by both the teacher and the principal and<br/>discussed annually.</p>

<p>Article XIV 5</p>
<p>ARTICLE XV<br/>UNIT MEMBER HOURS AND ADJUNCT DUTIES</p>
<p>15.1 Unit Member Work Year</p>
<p>15.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2014-2015 school year, the unit member work year shall be 185<br/>days effective July 1, 2014. The work year includes 180 student days,<br/>one (1) Professional Development Day and four (4) Teacher Work Days.<br/>The work year of 185 work days represents 100% of the certificated salary<br/>schedule as presented in Appendix B.</p>
<p>15.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year for certain unit members who may meet a special District<br/>need may be extended by mutual agreement between the individual and<br/>the District up to five (5) working days at either end of the regular work<br/>year with thirty (30) days’ notice. The unit member shall be compensated<br/>at the appropriate per diem rate for each day served.</p>
<p>15.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the site administrator, and with the approval of the unit<br/>member involved, a unit member may teach during his/her preparatory<br/>period. The unit member will be compensated for the equivalent of one<br/>period. At the secondary level the compensation will be 1/5 of the unit<br/>member's current salary.</p>
<p>15.1.3.1 The use of a preparatory period for instruction will be used on<br/>an emergency basis only. As an example, an emergency could<br/>result from an unanticipated growth or shift in student<br/>enrollment. All efforts will be made to anticipate enrollment<br/>changes to properly staff each site prior to the beginning of<br/>each school year. In case unit members are needed to teach<br/>during their preparatory period, efforts to eliminate this<br/>necessity will be made for the second semester.</p>
<p>Article XV 1</p>
<p>15.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall volunteer or be asked to teach during<br/>his/her preparatory period for two (2) consecutive years if<br/>there is any reasonable way to avoid such situation. No non-<br/>tenured unit member shall volunteer or be asked to teach<br/>during his/her preparatory period if there is any reasonable<br/>way to avoid such situation.</p>
<p>15.1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an emergency situation requires the use of a<br/>preparatory period for instruction, the position must be<br/>opened to all qualified teachers at the site. If more than one<br/>qualified applicant is available, consideration should be given<br/>to the unit member who has not recently served in this<br/>capacity.</p>
<p>15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support Services Personnel</p>
<p>15.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support Services Personnel, including but not limited to psychologists,<br/>speech, language and hearing specialists, speech therapists, counselors,<br/>resource specialist program teachers, adaptive P.E. specialists, and nurses<br/>shall have a work year consistent with that of the regular classroom<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>15.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year for Support Services Personnel may be extended up to five</p>
<p>(5) working days by the District at either end of the regular work year with<br/>thirty (30) days’ notice. By mutual agreement, the Support Services<br/>Personnel work year may be extended for additional days to meet District<br/>needs. Compensation shall be in accordance with Article XIX, Section</p>
<p>19.3.5.</p>
<p>15.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Member Workday</p>
<p>15.3.1 The length of the unit member workday, including a duty-free lunch<br/>period and break periods as required by law, shall be seven (7) hours and<br/>thirty-five (35) minutes except as provided for in Section 15.3.2 and as<br/>modified in Section 15.3.4.</p>

<p>15.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom teachers shall not be assigned to continuous classroom<br/>instruction for a period exceeding two (2) hours and thirty (30) minutes<br/>without having a break of at least ten (10) minutes. Conference or<br/>planning periods shall constitute the required break if they occur at<br/>intervals that limit the continuous instruction to two (2) hours and thirty<br/>(30) minutes or less.</p>
<p>15.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency Situations</p>
<p>All time during the on-site workday not assigned to direct student- teacher<br/>classroom time will be available for assignment at the discretion of the<br/>building principal or immediate supervisor when needed due to emergency<br/>situations. An emergency situation is a temporary unexpected set of<br/>circumstances that constitute a threat to students or employees. An<br/>emergency will not extend beyond a period of ten (10) days unless<br/>extended by an act of the Board of Education. Before assigning unit<br/>members to emergency supervision duty, the site principal or designees<br/>shall first ask for volunteers and shall assign all volunteers, if any, before<br/>any other unit members are assigned to emergency supervision.</p>
<p>15.4 Number of Preparations</p>

<p>Article XV 3</p>
<p>Such action, however, shall be limited to that which is reasonably possible<br/>and is not overly disruptive to the education of the students. If action<br/>satisfactory to the teacher involved has not been initiated by a site<br/>administrator within five (5) working days after a request has been made<br/>by the teacher, and upon request of the teacher, the site administrator and<br/>the teacher will meet with the Superintendent to determine what action<br/>may be taken to relieve the teacher’s load.</p>
<p>Remedial action mentioned above shall also be applicable in grades 6-12<br/>in cases of excessive numbers of preparations (four [4] or more) as jointly<br/>determined by the teacher and site administrator. A preparation is specific<br/>and separate planning and preparation for a particular grade or class.</p>
<p>15.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced time unit members at grades 4 and 5 shall have proportional<br/>reduced preparation time per day as in Section 15.4.5.</p>
<p>15.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school and high school teachers shall be entitled to one (1) period<br/>per day for the purpose of preparing, planning, and upon prior<br/>arrangement, conferring with parents.</p>
<p>15.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced time unit members at the secondary school level, except for<br/>secondary school counselors, shall have reduced proportional preparation<br/>time per day set aside exclusively for preparation, planning, and upon<br/>prior arrangement, conferencing with parents and students.</p>
<p>15.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time unit members at grades 4 and 5 shall have one preparation period<br/>per day of forty (40) minutes, thirty (30) of which shall be consecutive<br/>time, set aside exclusively for preparation and upon prior arrangement<br/>conferencing with parents. The prep time shall be exclusive of Section</p>
<p>15.3.3, duty-free lunch and pre- and post-school time.</p>
<p>15.5 Relief Breaks</p>
<p>It shall be the responsibility of the site administrator to see that, through class and</p>
<p>assignment schedules, each unit member has time for a physical relief break daily, if</p>
<p>requested.</p>
<p>Article XV 4</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty-Free Lunch</p>
<p>Each unit member shall have a duty-free, uninterrupted lunch period of at least forty-<br/>five (45) minutes, including five (5) minutes passing period.</p>
<p>15.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch Supervision</p>
<p>Without their consent, unit members shall not be required to supervise students<br/>during the students’ lunch period except in cases of extreme emergency, such as fire<br/>drills or other natural disaster drills or a situation involving a large scale student<br/>disturbance.</p>
<p>15.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Release</p>
<p>Subject to approval by the principal, a unit member may be released from on- site<br/>duties following the completion of the instructional day.</p>
<p>15.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel Between Schools</p>
<p>Unit member support personnel who travel from one school to another on a regular<br/>basis shall have the same rights to a planning/preparation period, lunch period, and<br/>physical relief breaks as do other unit members.</p>
<p>15.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Released Time for Committee Work and Meetings</p>
<p>Adequate release time may be granted to unit members who are assigned to<br/>committee work and meetings in connection with school-related activities.</p>

In cases where the District or its authorized<br/>representative specifies doubt as to the validity of the sick leave claim, an<br/>employee may, at the option of the district, be required to submit a<br/>physician’s statement or an acceptable substitute thereof for an absence of<br/>less than five (5) days. The District need not assume that a unit member’s<br/>statement establishes disability conclusively but may require a review<br/>and/or examination by a physician selected by the District or a practitioner<br/>of the employee’s faith selected by the District. All expenses of such review<br/>examination shall be borne by the District.</p>
<p>Whatever the claim of disability, no day of absence shall be considered a<br/>sick leave day on which unit members have engaged in a concerted work<br/>stoppage unless the unit member provides such certification as may be<br/>required by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>The personnel records of the District shall show the attendance of each unit<br/>member and such days that the unit member has been absent for reasons of<br/>illness, accident, or other causes. A record shall be maintained of the unused<br/>sick leave days accumulated by each unit member with a written statement<br/>showing both his accrued sick leave total and his sick leave entitlement for<br/>the school year. Such statement shall be provided on or about November 1.</p>
<p>Misuse of sick leave shall be considered a serious infraction of Board policy<br/>and this Agreement. Misuse of sick leave shall be considered grounds for<br/>discipline. Excessive yearly use of sick leave may be grounds for medical<br/>review as specified in Section 17.1.6.</p>

<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a serious illness or injury that incapacitates a unit member for a<br/>period of ten (10) or more consecutive duty days, or</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an illness or injury that incapacitates a member of the unit member’s<br/>immediate family, as defined in Section 17.1.1, requiring the unit<br/>member to take time off from work for ten (10) or more consecutive<br/>duty days to care for that family member.</p>
<p>17.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of the Sick Leave Bank</p>
<p>The purpose of the Catastrophic Illness or Event Sick Leave Bank is to<br/>create a bank of sick days from which participants may apply for additional<br/>sick leave days when a catastrophic illness or event occurs and results in the<br/>unit member exceeding accumulated sick leave days. A unit member shall<br/>exhaust all accrued sick leave prior to utilizing any leave days received<br/>from the Bank. Accrued sick leave does not include differential sick leave<br/>benefits provided for in this Article.</p>
<p>17.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment of a Sick Leave Bank</p>
<p>The District and ACT shall establish a Sick Leave Bank to which all unit<br/>members may donate earned and unused sick leave days. This donation<br/>shall be irrevocable, and shall be accomplished by the unit member filing a<br/>&quot;Sick Leave Bank Donation Form&quot; (Appendix E) prior to October 1 of the<br/>school year or within thirty (30) days of employment. This donation form<br/>shall be provided to unit members by the Association. A record of this<br/>donation is kept at the District Human Resources Department and will be<br/>updated annually. This form shall clearly state that sick leave days being<br/>donated are irrevocably given to the Sick Leave Bank and cannot be<br/>rescinded for any reason whatsoever. A donation to the Sick Leave Bank<br/>shall be a general donation and shall not be donated to a specific employee<br/>for his/her exclusive use. By November 1 of each school year, the District<br/>Human Resources Department shall notify the Association President or<br/>his/her designee of the total number of days in the Bank as of October 1 of<br/>that school year, and the names of unit members who made donations.</p>
<p>Article XVII 11</p>
<p>By July 15 of each school year, the District Human Resources Department<br/>shall notify the Association President or his/her designee of the total<br/>number of days in the Bank as of June 30 of that school year, and the names<br/>of the unit members who made donations. Upon request, the District shall<br/>notify the Association President or his or her designee of any changes to the<br/>balance of days and/or unit members in the Bank.</p>
<p>17.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for use of the Sick Leave Bank</p>
<p>The use of this Sick Leave Bank shall only be available to unit members<br/>who have submitted a donation form to the Human Resources office by<br/>October 1 of each school year, or within thirty (30) days of employment.<br/>The number of days donated requires a minimum of one day and a<br/>maximum of one-half of the unit member's accumulated sick leave days.<br/>The Association reserves the right to determine if a waiver of the annual<br/>donation requirement for current members of the Bank is appropriate, based<br/>on the total number of days accrued in the Bank and the expected utilization<br/>of those days. If such determination is made, written notice shall be<br/>provided to the Superintendent or designee, and bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>17.10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Sick Leave Bank is Granted</p>
<p>Unit members who suffer catastrophic illness or injury which results in the<br/>unit member using all available paid leave, allowed pursuant to this article<br/>shall become eligible to use this Sick Leave Bank, subject to restrictions<br/>and conditions outlined in this policy. The duration of Sick Leave Bank use<br/>shall continue until the catastrophic illness or event has been resolved. Upon<br/>resolution of the catastrophic illness or event and the return of the unit<br/>member to work on a regular basis, the unit member may use up to five (5)<br/>additional days from the sick leave bank in the same school year for any<br/>new sick leave.</p>
<p>17.10.5.1 Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of<br/>no more than forty (40) duty days. Unit members may submit a request for<br/>an extension of a withdrawal for up to two (2) additional forty (40) duty day<br/>allotments for each catastrophic illness or injury.</p>

<p>A day from the Sick Leave Bank shall be considered as equivalent to the<br/>compensation earned by the unit member as if that unit member had worked<br/>that day.</p>
<p>17.10.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees on Leave</p>
<p>Unit members who are granted Sick Leave Bank Days shall be considered<br/>to be in regular paid status during such leave.</p>
<p>17.10.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for Use of Sick Leave Bank Days Approval</p>
<p>A unit member desiring to receive donations from the Bank shall submit the<br/>request to the Association President on the designated request form. A unit<br/>member who requests a donation from the Bank will be required to submit a<br/>doctor’s statement indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the<br/>probable length of the absence. Sick Leave Bank use requests shall be<br/>reviewed by a committee consisting the Association Building<br/>Representative from the applicant’s site and four (4) Association Members,<br/>one from each school site, appointed by the Association President by<br/>October 1 of each year.</p>
<p>17.10.10.1 Applications of use of the Bank shall be reviewed and<br/>decisions of the committee reported to the applicant, and the<br/>District Superintendent or designee, in writing, within ten<br/>(10) duty days of receipt of the application.</p>

<p>Care Leave</p>
<p>A unit member who has been employed one year as a regular certificated<br/>employee of the District and who has worked at least 1250 hours in the<br/>previous twelve (12) month period of employment with the District shall be<br/>eligible for family care leave for up to twelve (12) workweeks within a<br/>twelve (12) month period.</p>
<p>Family Care Leave means leave for reason of the birth or adoption of the<br/>unit member’s child, or placement of foster child with the unit member<br/>within twelve (12) months of the event; leave to care for seriously ill child,<br/>spouse or parent; leave for the unit member’s own serious health condition.</p>
<p>When applicable, the District may require that a unit member’s request for<br/>Family Care Leave be supported by a certification issued by a health care<br/>provider of the individual requiring care.</p>
<p>Unit members granted family care leave must utilize all available paid leave<br/>during the period of leave. Following the exhaustion of all paid leave the<br/>unit member shall be placed on unpaid status for the remainder of the<br/>family care leave. For purposes of this section “available paid leave” means<br/>leave for which the unit member meets the District’s usual requirements for<br/>the use of such leave.</p>

<p>Coronado Unified School District - Evaluation Process</p>
<p>The Evaluation Process consists of four stages: New Certificated, Intermediate Certificated,<br/>Experienced Certificated and Improvement Plan. Each of the four stages includes the following:<br/>Goals/Objectives development. Informal and Formal Observations, and Conferences with the<br/>administrator to provide feedback and to discuss teaching practice and student achievement.<br/>Marzano states, “Goal setting and feedback used in tandem are probably more powerful than<br/>either one in isolation.”</p>
<p>The assessment of pupil progress will be thirty Percent (30%) of the evaluation of a certificated<br/>employee in factoring the final rating determination. Observed classroom performance, using the<br/>current evaluation tool, remains the primary and controlling factor at seventy percent (70%).</p>
<p>As determined by the Professional Development Committee, for the 2014-15 school year, the<br/>following assessments, in addition to others, may be used for this purpose:</p>

<p>Each certificated employee completes goals/objectives by September 30 each year (using<br/>Progress Adviser) dependent on which stage of the Evaluation Process will be used. The<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) as listed below will be used to develop<br/>goals/objectives.</p>
<p>Appendix D 1</p>
<p>Appendix D</p>
<p>California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard One: Engaging &amp; Supporting All Students in Learning</p>

<p>I. Experienced Teachers and New Teachers to the District<br/>(First and Second Year District Certificated Employees):</p>
<p>A. Using Progress Advisor employee writes six (6) goals using each of the six<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession. A pre-conference held by the<br/>administrator with the teacher regarding goal setting is recommended by<br/>September 30.</p>
<p>B. As the certificated employee and the administrator confer regarding the six (6)<br/>goals based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession, the<br/>Continuum of Teaching Practice may be used as a formative assessment system<br/>and self-reflection tool by the certificated employee.</p>
<p>C. The Continuum of Teaching Practice contains three essential components:<br/>standards, criteria (indicators that determine level of teacher development) and<br/>evidence of practice. Standards refer to the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession (CSTP) and are in alignment with the P-12 academic content<br/>standards. Criteria refer to indicators of teaching practice (level of teacher<br/>development).</p>
<p>Appendix D 2</p>
<p>Appendix D</p>
<p>Evidence of practice includes multiple sources such as lesson plans, observation<br/>data, and student work analyses and is used to make valid self-assessments on the<br/>Continuum of Teaching Practice.</p>
<p>(Additional examples for evidence of practice are provided in section VI of<br/>Appendix D-ACTION PLAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALTERNATE EVIDENCE OF</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE)</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Continuum of Teaching Practice is to be used as a source for developing<br/>goals and not as a check list. All CSTPs will be used as the basis for evaluation<br/>discussion between the administrator and the employee.</p>
<p>Evaluation Process/Criteria:</p>
<p>Three formal observations* (documented in Progress Advisor) must occur at<br/>this level (One observation due by 10/30, second due by 12/10 and the third<br/>by 4/15 to provide continual support through the end of the school year with a<br/>follow-up conference within three days of each observation.</p>
<p>Other criteria may include:</p>

<p>EXPERIENCED CERTIFICATED EVALUATION</p>
<p>(Seven or more years of experience in profession with tenure)</p>
<p>Feedback is an important part of the professional growth process. As an employee enters<br/>seven or more years of experience, scheduled observations provide opportunities for<br/>authentic feedback which will help deepen the practice of the experienced employee. It is<br/>recommended a formal meeting be scheduled between the administrator and the<br/>experienced employee to discuss teaching practices, to interact regarding strategic site<br/>and district goals and professional goals of the experienced employee.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Progress Adviser, employee develops at least two (2) Goals/Objectives<br/>using elements from at least two different standards from the CSTPs as mutually<br/>agreed to in a collaborative effort by the staff member and administrator by<br/>September 30.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One formal observation or a series of informal observations by mutual agreement<br/>of the administrator and employee will be completed every other year by<br/>February 15 with a follow-up conference within three days. If follow up<br/>observations (formal or informal) are required to address the goals submitted by<br/>the employee these will be completed by the evaluator in mutual agreement with<br/>the employee. Formal observations may also occur at the discretion of the<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Improvement Plan may be developed based on a “does not meet standard”<br/>rating in any one standard or element using Form 2 (Improvement Plan) to<br/>establish goals and objectives to remediate the deficiency.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Evaluation form/Conference (Progress Adviser - see End of Year<br/>Preparation, Appendix D) completed by May 1.</p>
<p>CERTIFICATED IMPROVEMENT PLAN</p>
<p>A certificated employee will be placed on an improvement plan based on a does not meet</p>
<p>standard on any one or more California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>A. A permanent certificated employee who receives a “does not meet standard” in<br/>one or more California Standards for the Teaching Profession will be provided<br/>assistance with an improvement plan. The administrator and employee will<br/>establish goals,-objectives and an Action Plan toward developing the appropriate<br/>skills necessary to remediate the deficiency. The Procedures for Improvement<br/>may include staff development options, list of resources, the opportunity to take<br/>advantage of PAR’s Consulting Teacher or Program Consultant programs, if<br/>funded and operative, or any other appropriate assistance available to the District.</p>
<p>Appendix D 6</p>
<p>Appendix D</p>
<p>If no improvement is noted at the final evaluation conference and the employee<br/>receives an unsatisfactory rating in one or more of the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession as indicated in Progress Adviser in the administrator’s<br/>comment section, the employee will be required to participate in the PAR<br/>Program, if funded and operative, as a Referred Participating Teacher during the<br/>next school year.</p>
<p>The employee may continue as a Referred Participating Teacher for another year<br/>if the employee is showing documented improvement. If improvement is not<br/>documented, action may be taken to dismiss the employee as provided in the<br/>Education Code.</p>

<p>Each certificated employee should have a copy of this Procedures Guide.</p>
<p>The Stull Act requires a written evaluation of certificated personnel at least every<br/>two years.</p>
<p>Effective staff evaluation benefits both students and teachers through improved<br/>teaching.</p>
<p>This Evaluation Procedure endeavors to: 1) provide the most effective assistance<br/>possible to improve teaching, 2) recognize the high quality of teaching that is<br/>synonymous with education in the Coronado Unified School District. Specific<br/>observations as outlined in Plans A and B in TIP do not preclude informal<br/>visitations or observations by an administrator.</p>
<p>Basic Evaluation Plans</p>
<p>All certificated personnel must receive a written evaluation every two years.<br/>Three types of evaluation. Evaluation A, Evaluation B, or goals and objectives<br/>conferences (Evaluation C) will be carried out under the direction of the site<br/>administrator. Certificated personnel will be periodically rotated through these<br/>three evaluation plans. If specific weaknesses have been identified by the site<br/>administrator and the teacher, then through the use of an agreed-upon Teaching<br/>Improvement Plan, hereafter referred to as TIP, these weaknesses will be<br/>remediated. The evaluation plans are detailed below:</p>
<p>Evaluation Plan A</p>
<p>Evaluation Plan A may result in a written evaluation of the teacher. The site<br/>administrator has the option of not evaluating a tenured teacher during Evaluation<br/>A provided that the teacher has had a written evaluation the preceding year. The<br/>information section of page one and all of page six of the evaluation form should<br/>be filled out for all certificated personnel each year. No teacher may remain<br/>under Evaluation A for more than three consecutive years. During the course of<br/>the “A” or “B” evaluation process, an administrator or teacher may initiate a TIP.<br/>A rating of unsatisfactory requires a TIP.</p>
<p>Appendix I (History) 10</p>
<p>If Evaluation A is to be written, it shall consist of not more than four contacts that<br/>include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goals and Objectives Conference (page 1) by October 31.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Observation (page 2) by February 15.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A follow-up conference within three working days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final conference between teacher and administrator (year-end teacher<br/>evaluation recommendations) by March 1.</p>
<p>Possible results of Evaluation A:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain in Evaluation A with or without TIP.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move to Evaluation B with or without TIP.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move to Evaluation C, Goals and Objectives (see page 6).</p>
<p>Evaluation Plan B</p>
<p>Upon the request of a site administrator or teacher, Evaluation B may be<br/>conducted by a mutually agreed-upon committee of teachers and administrators.<br/>It is anticipated that most teachers will receive a majority of ratings of satisfactory<br/>or better. If a teacher receives a rating of needs improvement in any component a<br/>TIP may be required in that component. A rating of unsatisfactory in any<br/>component requires a TIP in that component. Evaluation Plan B will result in a<br/>detailed written report. It shall consist of nor more than eight contacts that<br/>include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goals and Objectives Conference (page 1) by October 31.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First classroom observation (page 2) by December 1.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A follow-up conference within three working days.</p>
