<p>14.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed so as to limit the right of those<br/>considering lodging a grievance from discussing the matter informally with<br/>the aggrieved party’s immediate supervisor, with or without the Association's<br/>intervention and/or representation, in an attempt to resolve the matter<br/>informally. However, the aggrieved party shall have the right to the presence<br/>of an Association representative at all steps, at all conferences, and during any<br/>and all discussions and/or proceeding, formal or informal, concerned with<br/>processing or adjusting the grievance.</p>
<p>14.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will prevent the aggrieved party from proceeding<br/>through this Grievance Procedure without the Association’s intervention.<br/>However, any proposed resolution to a grievance shall not be implemented by<br/>the District until the Association has been provided a copy, and allowed an<br/>opportunity to respond, to determine if the resolution violates the contract.</p>

<p>Just Cause, Due Process and Progressive Discipline<br/>Permanent Bargaining Unit Members</p>
<p>1. Purpose</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is to establish just cause, due process and progressive discipline for<br/>disciplinary action affecting permanent bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties endorse the utilization of this Agreement and the contractual grievance<br/>and arbitration proceedings. Any alleged misconduct which can be remedied by<br/>progressive discipline shall be remedied in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District action to terminate employment remunerated under “Extra Pay for Extra<br/>Services” contracts as specified in this Agreement shall not be reviewable under<br/>this article.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>General Provisions</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation:</p>
<p>Upon request, bargaining unit members have the right to secure and utilize<br/>Association representation for any disciplinary meetings.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right of Rebuttal:</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall have the right to rebut any written warning or<br/>reprimand by submitting a written statement of their position. Such written<br/>rebuttal shall be attached to the warning or reprimand.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledgment of Receipt of Documents:</p>
<p>The bargaining unit member shall acknowledge receipt of all documents of a<br/>derogatory nature intended for placement in his/her personnel file in the manner<br/>set forth in Article 12, “Personnel Files” of this Agreement. Notice may also be<br/>documented by utilizing registered mail to transmit true copies of documents to be<br/>filed, return receipt requested.</p>
<p>The content of employee evaluations is not grievable. However, commentary<br/>alleging grounds for discipline as defined in this article, if included in such<br/>evaluations under Standard 6 (Developing as a Professional Educator), is<br/>grievable on the issues of whether just cause exists for such comments, and<br/>whether steps 4 (A)(B) and (C) below have been followed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grounds</p>
<p>Grounds for “progressive discipline” under this article shall consist of the following<br/>categories derived from the California Education Code Section 44932:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immoral or unprofessional conduct;</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dishonesty;</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evident unfitness for service;</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the State or reasonable<br/>regulations prescribed by the governing board of the District;</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of alcoholic beverages or other drug abuse which makes the bargaining unit<br/>member unfit to instruct or associate with children;</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conviction of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Progressive Di scipline</p>
<p>The parties agree that the purpose of progressive discipline is to offer the bargaining<br/>unit member an opportunity to improve his/her behavior and/or cease unacceptable<br/>behavior which may constitute grounds for discipline (Section 3 above). Subject to<br/>Section 4(E), administration of disciplinary action will generally conform to the<br/>following progression and procedures for “progressive discipline.” Under this article,<br/>which shall be pursuant to California Education Code Section 44932, the parties have<br/>no intent to use these steps to address instructional pedagogy.</p>
<p>A. Informal Level:</p>
<p>The parties believe that disciplinary questions and/or issues are best resolved by<br/>means of objective discussion between appropriate administrative personnel and</p>
<p>bargaining unit members. This is the first step prior to formal discipline. No<br/>written information regarding this level may be placed in a member’s personnel<br/>file.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Warnings:</p>
<p>Written warnings issued to the bargaining unit member constitute the first level of<br/>formal discipline. Written warnings may be issued when efforts at the informal<br/>level (discussion(s) and/or memo(s) of conference) do not result in satisfactory<br/>correction of the unit member’s behavior. The dates of discussion(s) and memo(s)<br/>of concern are to be attached to the written warning.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Reprimand:</p>
<p>Written reprimands for placement into the bargaining unit member’s personnel<br/>file constitute the second level of formal discipline. The District must append to<br/>the reprimand any prior written warnings and/or reprimands which are to be relied<br/>upon for any purpose.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspensions Without Pay:</p>
<p>A second written reprimand for placement into the bargaining unit member’s<br/>personnel file, which may include a written notice of suspensions without pay [not<br/>to exceed five (5) working days], shall constitute the third level of formal<br/>discipline. The District must append to the reprimand/notice of suspension any<br/>prior written warnings and/or reprimands which are to be relied upon for any<br/>purpose.</p>
<p>A third written reprimand for placement into the bargaining unit member’s<br/>personnel file, which may include a written notice of suspension without pay [not<br/>to exceed ten (10) working days], shall constitute the fourth level of formal<br/>discipline. The District must append to the reprimand/notice of suspension any<br/>prior written warnings and/or reprimands which are to be relied upon for any<br/>purpose.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While progressive discipline levels may not be bypassed arbitrarily or<br/>capriciously, nothing in the Article shall preclude full or partial bypass of such<br/>levels for serious misconduct of such a critical nature as to justify bypassing<br/>earlier levels of progressive discipline.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may not impose a suspension without pay until any grievance filed in<br/>response is settled or adjudicated.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the provisions of this Article limit in any manner the District’s<br/>decision to immediately implement dismissal or suspension (for more than fifteen<br/>(15) days) proceedings in accordance with the California Education Code.</p>

<p>41.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel shall deliberate whether:</p>
<p>41.4.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is now ‘proficient’ in the areas evaluated, or</p>
<p>41.4.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel and peer coach feel there should be more assistance,<br/>or</p>
<p>41.4.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel and peer coach do not consider that further<br/>assistance and remediation will be successful with reasons in<br/>support of this conclusion.</p>

<p>Appendix E</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>BETWEEN<br/>CENTRAL UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>AND</p>
<p>CENTRAL UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>The Central Unified School District (“District”) and the Central Unified Teachers<br/>Association (“CUTA”) enter into this Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) effective as<br/>of the 2014-15 school year based upon the following recitals:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, the State of California enacted the Local<br/>Contraol Funding Formula (“LCFF”) which has a stated goal of providing additional<br/>funds to serve the students of the State of California.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon full implementation of the LCFF, as a condition of the receipt of an additional<br/>adjustment to the kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive base grant (“additional<br/>Class Size Reduction CSR/GSA adjustment grant”), all school districts shall maintain<br/>an average class enrollment for each school site for kindergarten and grades 1 to 3,<br/>inclusive, of not more than 24 pupils, unless a “collectively bargained alternative<br/>ratio” is agreed to by the school district. (Education Code section 42238.02(d)(3)(D)).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the 2013-14 school year and continuing until section 42238 03(b)(4)<br/>is effective upon full implementation of the LCFF, as a condition of the receipt of the<br/>additional adjustment grant, school districts with class size averages of more than 24<br/>students will need to make progress towards maintaining an average class by<br/>enrollment of not more than 24 pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive per<br/>school site pursuant to the calculations outlines in 42238.02(d)(3)(B), unless a<br/>“collectively bargained alternative annual average class enrollment” for each school<br/>site in those grades is agreed to by the school district.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District works collectively with CUTA which represents the interests of the<br/>District's teaching staff.</p>
<p>1. Therefore, based on the recitals above and recognizing the benefits available to District</p>
<p>students and the community as a whole, the CUTA and the District agree as follows:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools with 300 or less students shall be considered one group. The group<br/>enrollment average for these schools for transitional kindergarten, kindergarten<br/>and grades 1 to 3, inclusive, may be up to the following averages:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2014-15 school year, 28:1 (no more than 30 in any class)</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2015-16 school year, 27 I (no more than 29 in any class)</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2016-17 school year, 26:1 (no more than 28 in any class)</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools with 301 or more students shall be considered one group. The group<br/>enrollment average for these schools for transitional kindergarten, kindergarten<br/>and grades 1 to 3, inclusive, may be up to the following averages:</p>
<p>i. For the 2014-15 school year, 28:1 (no more than 30 in any class)</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2015-16 school year, 27:1 (no more than 29 in any class)</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2016-17 school year, 26:1 (no more than 28 in any class)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties hereby agree that this MOU represents “a collectively bargained alternative<br/>annual average class enrollment for each school site” in grades K through 3 in accordance<br/>with paragraph (3) (B) of subdivision (d) of Section 42238.02 of the California’s<br/>Education Code.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties agree that the provisions of this MOU shall supersede and take place of the<br/>Article 7.3 CSR/GSA numbers for K-3 of the collective bargaining agreement in order to<br/>preserve CSR funding under LCFF. The Parties further acknowledge that should<br/>subsequent legislative or executive action change the requirements regarding class size<br/>averages and/or the additional Class Size Reduction (CSR) adjustment grant not be fully-<br/>funded to 2014-15 levels, the MOU will expire on its own terms and Article 7 shall<br/>become fully enforceable pending subsequent negotiations.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOU reflects the best efforts of the Parties to comply with the LCFF regarding class<br/>size reduction funding and the Parties’ commitment to work together to maintain the<br/>additional grand for the benefit of District students and the community as a whole.</p>
<p>The Parties represent they have read and understand the terms of this MOU and are</p>
<p>authorized to execute this MOU on behalf of the principals.</p>
