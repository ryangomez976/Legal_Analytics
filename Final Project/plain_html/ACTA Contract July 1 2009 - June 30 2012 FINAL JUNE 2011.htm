<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall teach a maximum of 54,000 minutes per year. Teaching time (for<br/>Article 6.8 only) refers to the instructional minutes calculations as required by Ed.<br/>Code 46201.</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the K-6 levels, a minimum preparation period of forty-five (45) minutes shall be<br/>provided each day. No required meeting(s) shall be held during the scheduled<br/>elementary preparation period (except by consensus of the teacher staff).</p>
<p>6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the junior high and high school levels, the preparation periods shall be staggered<br/>throughout the work day and work week. Preparation time may not be provided on a<br/>daily basis but shall be equalized over a two (2) week period. Holidays that may<br/>occur on Mondays will not be made up as part of any equalization effort. On a<br/>regular seven (7) period schedule, daily preparation equivalent to a class period will<br/>be provided. (Teach 6 ~ Preparation 1).</p>

Any variance from a study hall class assignment cannot include a class that<br/>is offered for credit. No more than 10% of a full-time site staff will be placed on a<br/>“special assignment” in-lieu of a study hall assignment without a 2/3 full-time staff<br/>approval. Any in-lieu assignment must be established by mutual agreement of the<br/>teacher and principal. Efforts will be made to provide preparation and study hall on<br/>alternate days, if possible. Study hall teachers will not be required to give homework<br/>or teach an assigned curriculum but will be expected to maintain appropriate<br/>classroom control.</p>

<p>6.11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent of a full-time prep period plus 1/6 of the prep period will be added<br/>to the teacher’s work day which may be divided/equalized over alternate days;</p>
<p>6.11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a teacher will not teach an extra class for consecutive years if there is an<br/>interest by other staff members to teach that class;</p>

<p>ACTA AGREEMENT 2009 - 2012</p>
<p>Article 22. Peer Assistance and Review</p>
<p>22.1 The Association and the District are continuously striving to provide the highest</p>
<p>possible quality of education. In order for students to succeed in learning, teachers<br/>must succeed in teaching. Therefore, the Association and the District agree to<br/>cooperate in the design and implementation of programs to improve the quality of<br/>instruction through expanded and improved professional development and peer<br/>assistance. Teachers referred to or who volunteer for the program are viewed as<br/>valuable professionals who deserve to have the best resources available provided to<br/>them in the interest of improving performance to a successful standard. The PAR<br/>program will exist and operate in compliance with the California Education Code.</p>
<p>22.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Program shall not deal with teachers’ employment issues that arise<br/>from accusations of neglect of duty or misconduct that are distinct from<br/>teachers’ evaluations in relationship to the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession and Article 8 (Evaluation) of this Agreement.</p>
<p>22.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Program in no manner diminishes the legal rights of bargaining unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>22.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District and the Association that this Article shall remain<br/>in effect for as long as specific state funding for the California Peer Assistance<br/>and Review Program for Teachers is received by the District. If state handing<br/>for the PAR Program is eliminated, this will be reviewed and a decision to<br/>discontinue will be part of the negotiation process.</p>
<p>22.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and Association agree that this Article shall be reopened if either<br/>the Education Code section 44500 et seq. or the State’s implementation<br/>guidelines or regulations are modified in any manner that adversely impacts a<br/>term of this Article. The parties further agree that this Article may be<br/>reopened at any time by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>Exhibit S. Sideletter of Agreement, August 28,2000</p>
<p>SIDELETTER OF AGREEMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</p>
<p>~ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND BETWEEN THE</p>
<p>AMADOR COUNTY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (“DISTRICT”) AND THE<br/>AMADOR COUNTY TEACHERS ASSOClATION/CTA/NEA (&quot;ACTA&quot;)</p>
<p>AUGUST 28,2000</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, kfie District has allowed certain certificated employees to share a 1.0 Full Time<br/>Equivalent position as &quot;part-time and/or shared positions&quot; so that the District may utilize the<br/>services of two teachers who may not otherwise have accepted or continued employment<br/>with the District if they had to work full time; ,</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, the District and ACTA agree that allowing part-time and/or shared positions for the<br/>people listed below has<sup>1</sup> resulted in an educational benefit for the District;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, the District and ACTA agree that one person in the part-time and/or shared position<br/>has tenure rights to a full-time position but is on leave in order to work less than full time,<br/>and the other person in the part time and/or shared position is a temporary employee working<br/>to cover the leave of the tenured employee;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, the District recently discovered that, in relation to the person in a part-time and/or<br/>shared position, the District misapplied or did not apply Article XV of the ACUSD/ACTA<br/>collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, the District granted part-time and/or shared<br/>position employees year-for-year salary credit when that part-time and/or shared position<br/>person returned to full time status (instead of the fractional credit as required under the<br/>collective bargaining agreement);</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, the District and ACTA have negotiated the issues surrounding the rights of their<br/>unit members who participate in a part-time and/or shared position, including the issue of<br/>what criteria to use to properly place an employee on the salary schedule after returning from<br/>a job share position;</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the parties agree to this side-letter agreement as follows:</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recitals listed above arc part of the agreement.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 2000-2001 school year, persons in part-time and/or shared positions<br/>will be moved on the salary schedule in accordance with the negotiated contract between the<br/>District and ACTA.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no identified property right to future placement on the salary schedule, any<br/>certificated employee that was in a part-time and/or shared position prior to 2000-2001 shall<br/>receive year-for-year salary credit for those years worked as a part-time and/or shared<br/>position when that employee returns to full time status with the District. For any years</p>
<p>^ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worked diirinit or after the 2000-2001 school year, the same part-time and/or shared position</p>
<p>employee will only receive such fractional credit as is contained in the negotiated contract<br/>between the District and ACTA.</p>
