<p>7.01 A. The work day for full-time unit members in the Plumas Unified School District<br/>shall begin 30 minutes before the time at which regular classes of the school are<br/>scheduled to begin as a matter of usual practice. It shall close not earlier than 30<br/>minutes after the conclusion of all regularly scheduled classes in the afternoon for<br/>that school on that day.</p>
<p>The bell schedule for the comprehensive high school in each attendance area will be<br/>the measure for determining the work day for Independent Study Staff,<br/>Continuation Staff, Itinerant Staff, and Home School Staff.</p>
<p>If a specially scheduled class extends beyond the regular school day, the work day<br/>shall be extended only for the teachers of the extended class (i.e. a kindergarten<br/>which begins before or goes beyond the rest of the school, or an &quot;X&quot; or &quot;A&quot; period<br/>drama or music class).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When unit members have other school-related responsibilities on a given day which<br/>require their attendance during hours beyond the school day, they may leave<br/>directly following their last regular school period assignment, after prior<br/>notification and clearance with their immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the periods of time before classes begin and after classes are concluded,<br/>when unit members are required to be at school, unit members shall make<br/>themselves available for supervision of students, conferences with students, with<br/>parents, with administrators and supervisors, or with student groups which might be<br/>part of the extra curricular assignments, and unless their duties require their<br/>presence elsewhere, they shall remain at their duty stations, e.g. classroom,<br/>counseling office.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be afforded a duty-free lunch period of no less than 30<br/>consecutive minutes each day. Should the scheduled elementary school lunch<br/>period be longer than 30 minutes, the unit member at the elementary school shall<br/>have the entire period duty free.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal may, whenever possible, seek a teacher volunteer to provide noon<br/>duty supervision in exchange for time for time. Time for time in this instance is<br/>defined as an authorization from the principal to leave school after student<br/>dismissal without staying the contractual 30 minutes.</p>

These obligations shall be enumerated in the form of<br/>Appendix C (On Campus Time Commitment for Instructors Teaching Less than<br/>Full-time).</p>
<p>G. Unit members directed by an administrator to travel in their own vehicles for<br/>work-related purposes shall be eligible to receive mileage reimbursement at the<br/>applicable IRS rate.

<p>All unit members will prepare lesson plans for their respective classes which will provide<br/>adequate guidance for substitutes and others who might have to take over the program<br/>during the absence of a unit member. The plans should be detailed enough to allow an<br/>individual with adequate background in the subject area to teach the class.</p>
<p>An emergency lesson plan is to be on file with the school secretary at all times in the<br/>event of a late arrival or other unexpected absence from duty.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may be required to perform duties beyond the work day, including:</p>

<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1.2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory completion of this professional learning, such as two of the<br/>district professional development days, shall be considered the<br/>equivalent of “collegiate work”, and “units” for the purpose of salary<br/>schedule advancement per sections 11 02(A), (B), and (C), and 11.05(E).<br/>The conversion rate shall be 15 hrs. training = 1 continuing education<br/>unit.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This training will replace 2 “buyback” days effective 7/1/06. The<br/>compensation previously offered for this training is being placed on the<br/>salary schedule effective 7/1/06, therefore, there will be no additional<br/>compensation paid to unit members for this training.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in the 2013/2014 school year, 7.5 hours of this professional<br/>learning shall be scheduled during the unit member work year. (This<br/>section 7.06 [D][3] shall be removed from this contract in the year the<br/>state of California once again requires 180 student days in an academic<br/>year.)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Monday collaboration time per month shall be allocated for<br/>independent planning.</p>
<p>7.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members, at their option, may agree to undertake additional activities including, but<br/>not limited to:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in personnel interviews</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in public and/or community relations programs undertaken by the<br/>school or school district, or both, upon the request of the administration.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving on educational committees</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming the steering committee chairmanship/co-chairmanship or responsibility<br/>for writing a school-level accreditation report.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researching various school/district needs</p>
<p>These additional activities which have been mutually agreed upon may in some cases<br/>require released time on the part of the unit member, as determined by the school<br/>principal.</p>
<p>7.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall make every effort to devote their energies during the work day to<br/>appropriate professional job-related activities. Preparation period shall be used primarily<br/>to perform school-related business or to enhance job performance. When the unit<br/>member leaves campus during a preparation period, the unit member must notify the<br/>school administration of his/her off-campus destination.</p>

<p>July 1,2013-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>7.09 A. At the secondary level, unit members may cover another teacher's classes or<br/>supervision duties during preparation periods.</p>
<p>Part time unit members who are assigned to teach in secondary schools shall be<br/>paid $40.00 per hour for no more than one period per day of class coverage or<br/>supervision for absent teachers at their assigned school.</p>
<p>Such covering of classes or supervision duties falls into one of three categories:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requested by the administration to cover a class or supervise, if no qualified<br/>substitute teacher is available. Unit members may request that the administrator<br/>seek someone else to perform the task. A unit member covering a class will be<br/>remunerated at the rate of $40.00/hour. No more than two compensatory days<br/>may be taken by a unit member at any one time. The teacher may only use a<br/>comp day if (s)he finds a regular substitute to cover that day. *(Comp days<br/>refer to those days earned prior to ratification of new language omitting comp<br/>time as an option.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required by the administration to cover a class or supervise, if no qualified<br/>substitute teacher is available. Unit member will be remunerated at the rate of<br/>$40.00/hour. No more than two compensatory days may be taken by a unit<br/>member at any one time. The teacher may only use a comp day if (s)he finds a<br/>regular substitute to cover that day. *(Comp days refer to those days earned<br/>prior to ratification of new language omitting comp time as an option.) To<br/>comply with Section 22.18, a resource specialist shall not be required to cover a<br/>regular class.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requested by another teacher to cover his/her class or supervise an assigned<br/>duty during preparation period. In such cases, the administrator/designee shall<br/>be notified with an explanation, and his/her approval granted prior to coverage.<br/>The unit member who voluntarily agrees to cover in this situation shall not be<br/>remunerated by the board, nor shall the teacher whose class or supervision is<br/>covered lose sick leave or salary.</p>
<p>B. Teachers at the elementary level and middle school may be directed by the<br/>administration to cover another unit member’s class, or portion of a class, as well<br/>as his/her own class when a unit member is absent from his/her assignment and a<br/>substitute is not available. In this event, the unit member will be remunerated at<br/>$40.00/hour for the actual time the unit member is directly supervising more than<br/>two additional students placed in his/her class under this provision. Unit members<br/>may request that the administrator seek someone else to perform the task.</p>

<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall leave a class unless provisions have been made for supervision of<br/>pupils as defined in Education Code and Title 5 of the California Administrative Code.</p>
<p>7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Positions. A full-time position may be shared. A shared position shall be<br/>initiated by any full-time unit member prior to April 15. The unit member initiating the<br/>shared position shall have the responsibility of assisting the site principal or supervisor in<br/>screening candidates and selecting candidates and serving on the interview team for the<br/>shared position, should this position involve the hiring of a temporary teacher. If a<br/>position is shared between two permanent teachers, the teachers and the principal shall<br/>mutually agree to the following requirements:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program must be approved by the unit member's administrative supervisor and<br/>the superintendent. It is the intent of this article that a program shall not be denied<br/>summarily or arbitrarily.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrative supervisor, working with the permanent employee desiring a<br/>shared contract, will work through the District personnel director to attempt to<br/>locate an acceptable full-time person to fill the other half of the shared position.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may agree to work one semester of each of a contract year; they<br/>may work a half day each; or other arrangements within a school year which<br/>shall be approved by the site administrator. This is to allow for flexible share<br/>arrangements. Alternate years are not an option.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort shall be made to ensure that shared contracts are first arranged<br/>between permanent employees.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher wanting to reduce his or her time for one year only may apply for a<br/>leave of absence as per Section 10. The teacher hired to fill such a vacancy will<br/>be hired as a temporary replacement.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each &quot;working&quot; unit member will perform duties required of any unit member<br/>under a full contract.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member in the program shall receive pro-rata benefits equal to that of a<br/>full-time unit member. Pro-rata benefits will be proportional to the work year. It<br/>will be the responsibility of a shared contract teacher who elects benefits to pay full<br/>insurance co-payment.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members participating in the shared position will earn STRS credit based on<br/>the portion of the year which has been taught.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tenured unit member sharing a position shall have tenure rights guaranteed by<br/>law and the right to request a transfer or return to full-time employment as<br/>provided in Section 10.16 H.l. A unit member shall notify the Governing Board<br/>in writing prior to February 15th of the school year of his/her intention to return<br/>to full-time employment in his/her attendance area the following school year.<br/>Unit members on shared contracts waiting for a full-time position must resubmit<br/>letters of intent by February 15th of each succeeding year. Failure to do so may<br/>result in a shared position continuing for another year with pro-rata benefits.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no available position within the unit member's attendance area, the<br/>employee may elect to return to an open full-time position in another attendance<br/>area; otherwise the employee will remain on the shared contract for the next<br/>succeeding year.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members participating in the shared position shall advance one full step on the<br/>salary schedule for each year they participate in the shared position.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member working first semester of a school year may be paid in ten<br/>equal payments.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member working second semester of a school year may be paid in ten<br/>equal payments, provided a surety is provided the school district to cover salary<br/>paid before service is rendered. The surety provided may be one of the<br/>following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment of a bank account or certificate of deposit covering the full<br/>amount of salary paid in advance of service</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust deed on real property</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members assigned to more than one school shall be given time for travel to<br/>these schools within the work day as defined in Sections 7.01 and 7.02.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who travel will be given reimbursement for round-trip mileage from<br/>school to school or shall be provided use of a District vehicle.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If unit members with a split assignment travel during their assigned prep period in<br/>the middle of the day, they will not be required to render routine student<br/>supervision duty activities at either school, except those duties for which extra<br/>compensation is provided, e.g. coaching, music, drama, etc. If a unit member is<br/>paid extra duty at two schools, compensation (i.e. stipends) will be given for both<br/>assigned duties.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All compensated extra duty shall be coordinated and adjusted at a meeting with the<br/>building administrators, the unit member involved, and a PCTA representative, if<br/>desired by the unit member.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members with split assignments who are directed by an administrator to travel<br/>on their assigned prep periods will be compensated at the subbing-on-prep rate<br/>(7.09[A][2]) for time spent travelling between assignments per the standard travel<br/>time table in 7.01G. This will be in addition to any other compensation provided<br/>for in sections 7.12 C., D., and E.</p>
<p>1. Part time unit members who have a split assignment shall be compensated for<br/>travel between assignments per this section.</p>
<p>7.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not be required to accept an assignment as part-time vice-principal.</p>
<p>7.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that the president and/or other members of the Association perform<br/>valuable services for the welfare of the school district. When the superintendent calls<br/>upon the president and/or other members for services of this type, the superintendent may<br/>authorize appropriate periods of released time for these services.</p>
<p>7.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal and certificated staff will discuss possible dates and the duration of the<br/>open house for that school. The principal will not make a decision as to the date and<br/>duration until he/she has conferred with the certificated staff.</p>
<p>7.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendar, (see Appendix F) The work year will include 184 paid teacher work days,<br/>including 179 student attendance days and five Professional Learning days, one of which<br/>is the day described in 7.06 (D)(3) which fulfills half of the 15 hour professional learning<br/>obligation described in 7.06(D).</p>
<p>1. Beginning in the 2013/2014 school year, 7.5 hours of this professional learning shall<br/>be scheduled during the unit member work year. (This section 7.06 [D][3] shall be</p>

<p>removed from this contract in the year the state of California once again requires 180<br/>student days in an academic year.)</p>
<p>7.17 If a Professional Learning activity is conducted during the work day, release time shall be<br/>provided for those designated by the District to attend.</p>
<p>The District shall provide Professional Learning according to the needs of the District, as<br/>determined by the District's annual survey of Professional Learning needs and/or other<br/>methods of determining Professional Learning needs. The Association, Board, and<br/>administration may each suggest areas of Professional Learning education.</p>
<p>7 .18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday School Hours of Employment: The teacher must be on site fifteen minutes prior</p>
<p>to the beginning of Saturday School. For example, Saturday School will begin at 8:30</p>
<p>a.m. and the teacher will be expected to be in the classroom at 8:15 a.m. Students will be<br/>expected to be in attendance from 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. The teacher may leave after<br/>the last student departs from the school or at noon. If students still remain at the school,<br/>the teacher will contact the administrator/designee.</p>
<p>Selection of Saturday School Teachers: Positions will be advertised to current District<br/>employees (including elementary and special services). If no currently employed<br/>certificated employees are available, then substitute teachers from the District list will be<br/>sought. Teachers will be hired by voluntary seniority and will not be involuntarily<br/>assigned. The positions shall rotate between any and all unit members. If the<br/>administration can document a unit member's inability to provide adequate supervision<br/>for Saturday School, that teacher may be excluded from the rotation.</p>
<p>Grade Levels: Saturday School will be for grades 7-12; however, it is optional for each<br/>elementary school to have its own Saturday School session when it has accumulated six<br/>unexcused absences to be made up in this manner (grades 4-6). Elementary students may<br/>attend Saturday School with grades 7-12 students upon agreement of the elementary and<br/>high school administrators.</p>
<p>7.19 The District and Association agree that stabilized employment is an important objective<br/>to be attained. Therefore, the District agrees that during the life of this agreement, no<br/>work or services previously performed by members of the bargaining unit will be<br/>subcontracted, transferred, or assigned, in whole or in part, to any other district, services,<br/>region, or non-unit employees except as necessitated by IEP team recommendations<br/>and/or changes in current state and federal law or statutes.</p>

<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1. 2013 - June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>SECTION 8 - PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING GRIEVANCES RELATIVE TO<br/>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>8.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for the consideration of<br/>grievances.</p>
<p>8.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance is an alleged violation, misapplication, or misinterpretation of specific<br/>provisions of this contract.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;grievant&quot; is any unit member, including the Association or representative<br/>thereof, filing the grievance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the central administrative office of the Plumas Unified<br/>School District is open for business. All communication for the purpose of this<br/>section between the grievant or his/her representative and the administration shall<br/>be between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; at the school level is the principal; at other than the<br/>school level, the administrator designated by the superintendent.</p>
<p>8.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievant may present a grievance relating to specific sections of the contract to<br/>his/her employer and have such grievance(s) addressed and resolved consistent with<br/>terms of this Agreement. There shall be no resolution of the grievance until the<br/>Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution.</p>
<p>8.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant has the right to have a representative present at any step of the grievance<br/>procedure. The grievant, however, must be present at each step of the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>8.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to any grievance(s). Both parties agree that these proceedings will be<br/>kept confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>8.06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of the grievance shall not be construed as reflecting unfavorably upon a unit<br/>member's or immediate supervisor's good standing, performance, loyalty, or desirability<br/>to the Association or Board. Grievant, grievant representatives, and all other persons<br/>involved in the presentation of a grievance shall be free from restraint, interference,<br/>coercion, discrimination, or reprisal.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1,2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>8.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the administration to adhere to decision deadlines or failure to request<br/>extension of deadlines shall mean that the administration finds in favor of the grievant for<br/>any remedy not prohibited by law or by Board policy. Failure of the grievant to adhere to<br/>the submission deadlines or failure to request extension of deadline shall mean that the<br/>grievant is satisfied with the last decision and waives any right to further appeal. The<br/>administration shall notify the PCTA president and grievance representative of the<br/>association whenever a grievant has failed to adhere to the submission deadlines.</p>
<p>8.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If grievance meetings or hearings must be scheduled during the work day, as defined in<br/>paragraph 7.01, any employee required by either party to participate as a witness or<br/>grievant in such meetings or hearings shall be released from regular duties without loss of<br/>pay, as mutually agreed.</p>
<p>8.09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grievance has been filed by a grievant, the grievant may terminate the grievance<br/>at any time by giving written notice to the superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>8.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievant who has a grievance shall present the grievance orally to the<br/>immediate supervisor within fifteen (15) days after the grievant knew, or<br/>reasonably should have known, of the circumstances which form the basis for the<br/>grievance. The administrator shall hold a conference with the grievant in an<br/>attempt to resolve the matter within three days after the presentation of the<br/>grievance. This informal conference may, at the grievant’s option, be held between<br/>the immediate supervisor and the PCTA Grievance Chairperson, or designee.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Association initiates a grievance, the Association shall have fifteen<br/>(15) days following the next regular monthly PCTA executive board meeting in<br/>which to file the grievance.</p>
<p>Each new incident or on-going incidences, of the same grievable contract section(s)<br/>may be included and considered in an on-going grievance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may assume responsibility for a grievance at any level. When the<br/>Association takes such action, the Association shall notify the unit member's<br/>immediate supervisor, the District personnel office, and the superintendent, in<br/>writing.</p>
<p>8.11 Formal Level: The grievant and the responding supervisor shall refer to specific sections<br/>of the Agreement at all formal level actions. Each supervisor shall give a specific<br/>response to each section of the Agreement allegedly violated. Grievances that do not<br/>refer to specific contract sections and sub-sections on the grievance form shall be<br/>returned to the grievant for completion and re-submission. Grievances thus re-submitted<br/>shall start a new 15 day timeline per 8.11(A)(1)</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1,2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>8.11 A.</p>
<p>Level I</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within fifteen (15) days after the informal conference, the grievant must present<br/>the grievance in writing on Form GP-1 to the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This writing shall be a clear and concise statement of the grievance, the specific<br/>contract sections and subsections alleged to have been violated, misinterpreted,<br/>or misapplied, the circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the informal<br/>conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator shall give a specific response to each section of the<br/>Agreement allegedly violated, including rationale, to the grievant and to the<br/>PCTA grievance representative, in writing on Form GP-2 within fifteen (15)<br/>days after receiving the grievance (Form GP-1).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above timelines, either party may request personal conferences.</p>
<p>B. Level II</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the superintendent decide to have a designee handle grievances at Level<br/>II, the Association shall be so informed in writing. This designee shall act in the<br/>place of the superintendent and his/her decision will be the formal decision of<br/>the District, which may be appealed to Level III.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the decision may be<br/>appealed to the superintendent or designee on Form GP-3, within fifteen (15)<br/>days of the decision of Form GP-2.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal shall include a copy of the Level I (Form GP-1) grievance, the Level<br/>I decision (Form GP-2), and a clear, concise statement of reason for the appeal<br/>on Form GP-3.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superintendent or designee shall schedule a meeting with the grievant<br/>within fifteen (15) days of receiving Form GP-3. Additional meetings may be<br/>scheduled by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superintendent shall communicate his/her decision to the grievant and to the<br/>PCTA representative, on Form GP-4, within fifteen (15) days of the last meeting<br/>held per section 8.11 B.4.</p>
<p>8.11 C. Level III - Mediation</p>
<p>1. If the grievant and/or the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance, (Form GP-4), or if no disposition has occurred pursuant to the<br/>provisions of Level Two, the grievance may be referred to grievance mediation</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>(Form GP-5). Mediation will occur only with the concurrence of the District<br/>and Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If mediation is not chosen by both parties within fifteen days, the grievance will<br/>proceed to Level IV Binding Arbitration (Form GP-6).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should mediation be agreed upon, the Association shall request that the<br/>California State Mediation and Conciliation Service assign a mediator to assist<br/>the parties in the resolution of the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mediator, within fifteen (15) days of request, shall meet with the<br/>Association and the District, at a time and place mutually agreeable to both<br/>parties.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance was initially filed by or on behalf of one or more individual unit<br/>members, such members may be present during mediation upon request of the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an agreement is reached, the agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall<br/>be signed by the grievant, the Association and the District. This agreement shall<br/>be non-precedential and shall constitute a settlement of the grievance.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Association and the Superintendent or his/her designee have<br/>not resolved the grievance with the assistance of the conciliator/mediator within<br/>five (5) days from the first meeting held by the conciliator/mediator, the<br/>Association may terminate Level Three and the grievance shall proceed to Level<br/>Four (Form GP-6).</p>
<p>D. Level IV - Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level<br/>II, or III, they may submit the grievance to Binding Arbitration. The grievant<br/>and the Association shall notify the superintendent or designee on Form GP-6<br/>within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of Form GP-4, or within five (5) days of<br/>the Level III mediation meeting, if the grievance is being submitted to Binding<br/>Arbitration. If any questions arise as to whether a grievance can be arbitrated or<br/>not, such question will be ruled upon by the arbitrator only after he/she has had<br/>an opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association.<br/>Expedited labor arbitration rules shall apply if mutually agreed to by the<br/>Association and Board. Otherwise a full arbitration report will be prepared.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by a professional arbitrator to be<br/>selected by the District and Association within seven (7) days after the request</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1,2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>is received by the superintendent. If an arbitrator cannot be agreed upon, the<br/>following selection procedure will be employed:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Arbitration Association shall be requested to supply a panel<br/>of five names of arbitrators experienced in arbitrating public school<br/>grievances.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of an arbitrator shall be determined by an elimination process<br/>in which the first party shall be determined by a flip of the coin; then each<br/>party shall alternately remove a name until only one name remains.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCTA and PUSD shall request in writing a mutually agreed-upon deadline<br/>for the decision by the arbitrator, and shall include the deadline in the<br/>arbitration contract.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth his findings of fact,<br/>reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted unless expedited rules apply.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superintendent. Association, and grievant shall be given copies of the<br/>decision and the arbitrator’s report. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final<br/>and binding on all parties.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will be without power or authority to make any decision which<br/>requires the commission of an act prohibited by law or which violates the terms<br/>of this Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to<br/>include in any award such financial reimbursement or other remedies as he/she<br/>judges to be proper, with the exception that it is understood that the Association<br/>and District shall always be responsible for paying for their own respective<br/>costs (attorneys’ fees, etc.) for preparing and presenting a case for arbitration.<br/>The arbitrator is specifically prohibited from including these fees in any award.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to per diem<br/>expenses, travel and subsistence expenses, and the cost of any hearing room,<br/>will be borne equally by the District and the Association.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary labor arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association<br/>shall apply to all arbitrations conducted under this section, with the exceptions<br/>outlined in Section 8.11.C.6.</p>
<p>8.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance<br/>will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the regular personnel file<br/>of any of the participants^</p>
<p>8.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member of the bargaining unit shall receive a complete updated version of the<br/>current contract within thirty (30) days of ratification for each contract year. This shall<br/>be provided by the District.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee shall have the right to initiate a written response to the evaluation,<br/>and that response shall become a permanent attachment to the evaluation in the<br/>evaluatee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>9.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall make every effort to keep their instructional skills current and<br/>effective by participation in appropriate inservice and professional programs. The<br/>administrator conducting the evaluation of the unit member shall specify skills which<br/>need upgrading and/or recommended inservice needs.</p>
<p>9.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation instrument (Appendix A) shall be used in the process of evaluating the<br/>performance and growth of all certificated personnel.</p>
<p>9.09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide a more broadly based measure of effectiveness, unit members<br/>teaching grades 7 through 12 shall present students with a formal opportunity to review<br/>performance, in writing, at least once each semester.

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superintendent or his/her designee may initiate discipline for &quot;just cause.&quot;<br/>Except in those situations where a suspension is imposed per section (G) below,<br/>progressive discipline shall follow a sequence of due process such as an oral<br/>warning, a written warning, and/or a written reprimand. Following these<br/>procedures, the District may initiate suspension with pay or suspension without pay<br/>for up to 15 working days.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to such discipline being imposed, the superintendent or his/her designee will<br/>discuss the proposed action and the reasons for the proposed action with the unit<br/>member and take into account any response of the unit member. The unit member,<br/>at his/her option, may have the counsel of a CTA representative during the<br/>proceedings.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten school days, as indicated on the school calendar, after the discipline has<br/>been imposed by the superintendent or his/her designee through written notice to<br/>the unit member containing the specific discipline imposed, the charge(s), and a<br/>statement of the unit member's appeal right, the unit member may file a written<br/>appeal in the office of the superintendent.

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluative materials in the personnel files of a unit member which may serve as a<br/>basis for affecting the evaluation of performance are to be made available for the<br/>inspection of the person involved, providing that the request is made at the time<br/>when such person is not actually required to be at a duty assignment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluative information of a derogatory nature, except material obtained prior to<br/>employment of a unit member involved, shall not be entered or filed in the District<br/>or school personnel file unless and until the unit member is given notice and an<br/>opportunity to review and comment thereon.

<p>SECTION 10 - LEAVE AND TRANSFER</p>
<p>10.01 Leave</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During an unpaid leave of absence the unit member may continue coverage under<br/>health and welfare benefits by arranging with the District to have premiums paid by<br/>the unit member.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member on a paid or unpaid leave of absence or laid off and subject to recall<br/>rights shall maintain his/her original position on the District seniority list as<br/>determined by first date of paid service in the District or County. This shall not<br/>extend beyond two years for probationary and 39 months for permanent.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who receives a leave granted by the Board, shall be notified by<br/>the administration, in writing, within fifteen (15) working days as to the conditions<br/>of the leave, including medical coverage while on leave, the reemployment rights to<br/>which the unit member is entitled, and the deadlines which apply with respect to<br/>the employee notifying the District of his/her intent to return. A list of those unit<br/>members on leave for each quarter will be available to PCTA.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All leaves shall be applied for on District forms, available from all site supervisors'<br/>offices.</p>
<p>10.02 Sick Leave. A unit member employed full time shall be entitled to leave of absence for<br/>illness, accident, quarantine, or injury at full pay at the rate of one day per working<br/>month. In no case shall the amount be less than 10 days, for a unit member employed full<br/>time, available on the first day of the school year. Any unused portion of the earned<br/>annual sick leave shall be accumulated without limit and is transferable from district to<br/>district. Unit members simultaneously employed by both the District and the Plumas<br/>County Superintendent of Schools shall have a separate sick leave allocation and<br/>accumulated balance for each employer, calculated per section 10.13. Said<br/>simultaneously-employed unit members may not transfer leave days between employers.<br/>Said simultaneously-employed unit members who are subsequently fully-employed by<br/>either employer shall have their accumulated sick leave balances transferred per Ed Code<br/>section 44979.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may use any credited sick leave at any time during the school year<br/>for reasons of illness (of unit member or unit member’s child) or personal necessity<br/>as defined in this Agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum increment for sick leave (Section 10.02) or leave of absence for<br/>personal necessity (Section 10.04) shall be on-half day.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sick leave benefits are exhausted, if a unit member is absent from duty on<br/>account of illness or accident for a period of five months or less, the amount</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1,2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>deducted from the salary due for any month in which the absence occurs shall be<br/>the sum which is actually paid a substitute employed to fill the position during the<br/>absence, or that which a substitute would have been paid had a substitute been<br/>employed.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall continue to receive normal salary during the use of sick leave,<br/>until such time that the sick leave is exhausted.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member on sick leave, who exhausts his/her sick leave benefits and also<br/>his/her five months of differential pay, may be granted, at the Board's discretion, an<br/>unpaid leave for the remainder of the illness or at a maximum for the remainder of<br/>the school year. Any unit member granted an unpaid leave under this section shall<br/>be required to notify the district superintendent by July 1<sup>st</sup> of his/her intention to<br/>return to employment, or to request an additional sick leave for the upcoming<br/>school year.</p>
<p>Failure to notify the superintendent by the July 1<sup>st</sup> deadline may result in a position<br/>being unavailable to the unit member and ineligibility for any type of leave,<br/>including sick leave and differential pay.</p>
<p>In the case where additional sick leave is requested by July 1<sup>st</sup> for the upcoming<br/>school year, the unit member will be required to present a written recommendation<br/>from a state licensed medical doctor, which supports the leave request. In<br/>situations where the Board or superintendent desires a second opinion, the unit<br/>member may be required to be examined by a physician selected from a list of<br/>physicians provided by the District's Worker's Compensation administrator, at the<br/>District's expense, prior to action being taken by the Board. The physician will be<br/>required to develop a recommendation on the leave and provide medical evidence<br/>to support his/her recommendation. In such cases, the employee must agree in<br/>writing to allow the physician to release his/her findings to the superintendent.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Program</p>
<p>1. Definition</p>
<p>“Catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates<br/>a member of the employee’s family whose incapacity requires the employee<br/>to take time off work for an extended period of time to care for that family<br/>member, and taking extended time off creates a financial hardship for the<br/>employee because he or she has exhausted all of his/her sick leave and other<br/>paid time off. (Education Code 44043.5)</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is required to be absent from duty because of pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, adoption, childbirth, and recovery therefrom is entitled to leave under<br/>this section. The length of the leave of absence for pregnancy or childbirth,<br/>including the date on which the leave is to commence and the date the unit member<br/>shall resume duties, shall be determined by the unit member and physician. The<br/>length of an adoption leave shall be determined by the unit member and the school<br/>board as per Section 10.03 C.</p>
<p>A unit member who is contemplating adoption should give his or her supervisor<br/>reasonable notification of intent and probable process of pending adoption.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disability or any absences caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage,<br/>childbirth, and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary<br/>disabilities and shall be treated as such and therefore shall be covered by<br/>accumulated sick leave. The Board shall apply its policies and practices to<br/>disabilities due to pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions applied<br/>to other temporary disabilities. The Board shall grant leave with pay only when it<br/>is necessary to do so in order that leaves of absence for disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, or childbirth be treated the same as<br/>leaves for illness, injury, or disability.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request 30 days in advance, a unit member shall be granted a leave of absence<br/>without pay during the first year after the birth or adoption of his/her child or<br/>children for a period mutually agreed upon by the unit member and the Board.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member seeks such a leave to resolve family problems following a<br/>crisis and/or to prevent a crisis.

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the<br/>unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due for the same<br/>illness or injury.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments received as a result of disability indemnity arising out of Workers'<br/>Compensation shall be paid to the Board. Regular salary warrants shall then be<br/>issued by the Board, with normal deductions for retirement and other authorized<br/>deductions.</p>
<p>Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member shall<br/>be entitled to the benefits provided in Sections 44977, 44978, and 44983 of the<br/>Education Code, and for the purposes of each of these sections the absence shall be<br/>deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or<br/>illness leave, provided that, if the unit member continues to receive temporary<br/>disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much of the accumulated sick<br/>leave which, when added to temporary disability indemnity, will result in a<br/>payment of not more than full salary. The Board provides for no such additional</p>

<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1,2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>10.07 B. Eligibility</p>
<p>Any eligible employee who has served the District more than one continuous year<br/>shall be eligible to take unpaid family care and medical leave under the provisions<br/>of state and federal law. The District may deny family care and medical leave to<br/>employees who worked fewer than 1,250 hours during the previous year.</p>
<p>Family care and medical leave may be used for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the birth of the employee’s child, and in order to care for the<br/>child.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the placement of a child with the employee for foster care or in<br/>connection with the employee’s adoption of the child.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to care for the employee’s immediate family member.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the employee’s own serious health condition which makes the<br/>employee unable to perform the functions of his/her job, except for leave<br/>taken for disability on account of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical<br/>conditions.</p>
<p>C. Requests. Advance Notice and Certification</p>
<p>When possible, the employee shall give the District at least 30 days’ written<br/>advance notice of his/her need for family care and medical leave. If the employee<br/>learns of the need for this leave fewer than 30 days in advance, he/she shall provide<br/>such notice as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>If leave is needed for a planned medical treatment or supervision, the employee<br/>shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment or supervision to avoid<br/>disruption of district operations. This scheduling shall be subject to the health care<br/>provider’s approval.</p>
<p>When requesting family care and medical leave because of a serious health<br/>condition, the request shall be supported by a certification from the health care<br/>provider of the person requiring care. This certification shall include the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date on which the serious health condition began.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probable duration of the condition.</p>
<p>41</p>

<p>3. If the employee is requesting leave to care for an immediate family member who<br/>has a serious health condition, the health care provider’s certification of both of<br/>the following:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<p>a.</p></td><td>
<p>Estimated amount of time the health care provider believes the employee<br/>needs to care for the child, parent or spouse.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>b.</p></td><td>
<p>Statement that the serious health condition warrants the participation of a<br/>family member to provide care during a period of the treatment or<br/>supervision of the child, parent or spouse.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>4. a.</p></td><td>
<p>If the employee is requesting leave because of his/her own serious health<br/>condition, the health care provider’s certification that due to the serious<br/>health condition, the employee is unable temporarily to perform the<br/>functions of his/her job.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>b.</p></td><td>
<p>The health care provider’s certification need not identify the serious health<br/>condition involved. When the employee is requesting leave because of<br/>his/her own serious health condition, this information may be included at<br/>the employee’s option.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>c.</p></td><td>
<p>If additional leave is needed when the time estimated by the health care<br/>provider expires, the District may require the employee to provide<br/>recertification as specified above.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>d.</p></td><td>
<p>If the employee is requesting leave for intermittent treatment or is<br/>requesting leave on a reduced leave schedule for planned medical<br/>treatment, the certification must also state the medical necessity for the<br/>leave, the dates on which treatment is expected to be given, the duration of<br/>such treatment, and the expected duration of the leave.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>e.</p></td><td>
<p>If the District has reason to doubt the validity of a certification that<br/>accompanies a request for leave, the district may challenge the<br/>certification and require the employee to obtain, at District expense, a<br/>second opinion from a district-approved health care practitioner. If the<br/>second opinion is contrary to the first, the District may require, again at<br/>District expense, that the employee obtain a third medical opinion from a<br/>third health care practitioner approved by both the employee and the<br/>District.</p></td></tr>

<p>43</p>
<p>temporarily to a different job, if such position is available, that has the equivalent<br/>pay and benefits but could better accommodate recurring periods of leave. The<br/>employee must be qualified for the position, but the position does not need to have<br/>equivalent duties.

<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance of Benefits</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall also continue to be entitled to participate in life, disability<br/>and accident insurance plans, pension and retirement plans, supplemental<br/>unemployment benefit plans, and/or any other employee welfare benefit plan to<br/>the same extent and under the same conditions as apply to an unpaid leave<br/>taken for any other purpose. In the absence of these conditions, the employee<br/>shall continue to be entitled to participate in these plans and the District may, at<br/>its discretion, require the employee to pay the premium for periods not covered<br/>by accrued leave.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance of Status</p>
<p>The employee shall retain his/her employee status with the District during the leave<br/>period, and the leave shall not constitute a break in service for purposes of<br/>longevity or seniority under any employee benefit plan or collective bargaining<br/>agreement.

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monies in the Professional Growth Leave Fund as of 8/28/02 which are not<br/>allocated to individual unit members or sites per sections 10.14 A. 4, 5, and 6<br/>will be recouped by the district.</p>

<p>10.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer.</p>
<p>A. Definitions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer refers to any movement of a unit member from one school<br/>organization site to another within the District (i.e. Chester Elementary School<br/>to Greenville Elementary School).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassignment refers to:</p>
<p>I. At the elementary level, a change in job assignment from one elementary<br/>grade level to another. A change of assignment to a combination grade class<br/>from a single grade class is a reassignment. A change of assignment from a<br/>combination grade class to a single grade class (provided the single grade was<br/>one of the grades in the previous-year’s combination class) is not a<br/>reassignment for purposes of this section.</p>
<p>n. At the secondary level, the assignment of at least four classes (“preps”)<br/>not taught by the teacher during the immediately preceding year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A relocation refers to a change of a teacher’s regular teaching station within<br/>the same school organization site.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1,2013-June 30,2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>4. Movement of unit members between employers (PUSD to PCOE, or PCOE to<br/>PUSD) is not a transfer, relocation, or reassignment, and is not governed by<br/>this section.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer, reassignment, or relocation may be employee initiated (&quot;voluntary&quot;) or<br/>employer initiated (&quot;administrative” or “involuntary&quot;). Unit members shall, within<br/>ten days of being notified of a transfer, reassignment, or relocation, provide their<br/>current supervisor with a written statement (appendix I) that the transfer,<br/>reassignment, or relocation is involuntary. The supervisor shall cause this<br/>statement to be placed in the unit member’s personnel file. If the unit member does<br/>not provide this written statement within ten days, the transfer, reassignment, or<br/>relocation shall be considered voluntary.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitation of transfer and reassignment:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be transferred or reassigned to teach only within their<br/>credential authorization or as mutually agreed upon by the Board and the<br/>unit member, with special provisions of the Board as provided for under<br/>law.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members seeking a voluntary transfer to a grade level (K-4, 4-8)<br/>or 7-12 core subject area (as defined by NCLB or successor<br/>legislation) to which they have not been assigned within the past 10<br/>years may be required to verify competence to an interview panel<br/>composed of the principal and at least two teachers from the site to<br/>which the transfer is requested. The panel, by majority vote, may<br/>deny the transfer if the interview process determines that the unit<br/>member is not currently prepared to teach successfully this grade<br/>level or subject matter.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies created after the school year has begun, but before April 15,<br/>shall be advertised for voluntary transfer for 48 hours on the PUSD web<br/>site. Unit members with valid transfer requests on file per section</p>
<p>10.17(B) shall be notified by telephone of the transfer opportunity. At the<br/>conclusion of the 48 hour advertising period, the vacancy shall be filled<br/>according to sections 10.16 (H) and (I)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After April 15 of the school year, prior to the school year in which a<br/>transfer would become effective, priority to bargaining unit members may<br/>not be assigned over other qualified applicants who have applied for<br/>positions requiring certification qualification. Unit members desiring to<br/>be transferred will be considered on an equal basis with other applicants.<br/>(EC 35036)</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any newly created position or open position created as a result of retirement, death,<br/>leave, (one year or more), transfer, resignation, or dismissal shall be deemed a<br/>vacancy. Vacancies created by a leave of absence shall be temporary vacancies.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member returning from a leave of absence may be placed into a vacancy at<br/>the school at which he/she was employed immediately prior to the leave, in which<br/>case, that vacancy need not be announced or posted.</p>

The<br/>filing period for all vacancies shall be no less than two weeks from the date of<br/>posting at the District Office and no less than ten days from date of posting at each<br/>school, (except those created after the school year has begun, per 10.16[C][3]).</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies created before April 15 shall be filled through voluntary transfer before<br/>being filled through administrative transfer, laid-off teacher rehire, or the hiring of a<br/>new teacher. If more than one unit member applies for a voluntary transfer to a<br/>vacancy created before April 15, the District shall grant the transfer according to the<br/>following order of priority:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First priority shall be given to permanent unit members requesting a transfer,<br/>or a return to full-time from a shared contract.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second priority shall be given to probationary unit members requesting a<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third priority shall be given to temporary unit members who have worked at<br/>least 75% of the hours or days of a school year, and who have been re¬<br/>employed for the following year. These unit members shall have the option of</p>

<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>the next probationary contract opening for which the unit member is qualified,<br/>after higher priority transfers, if any, have been processed per Education<br/>Code. It is understood that temporary employees do not develop seniority and<br/>therefore the administration may freely select from the group of eligible<br/>temporary employees should there be more than one.</p>
<p>I. Transfer requests for transfer into vacancies created before April 15, or requests to<br/>return to full-time from shared positions from unit members with equal priority<br/>shall be selected by the principal through a competitive interview process. The<br/>principal shall convene an interview panel to assist and advise him or her in the<br/>selection process.

Proximity of the unit member's residence to the assigned<br/>site will be given due consideration in selecting the unit member for transfer.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that compelling circumstances require that a unit member be<br/>transferred on an administrative basis for his/her welfare and/or the welfare of the<br/>District, the unit member shall be informed in writing of the reason(s) for this<br/>action by the superintendent or designee. This notification shall take place as early<br/>as possible, but in no case shall there be less than a reasonable period of<br/>notification prior to the date of the intended transfer.

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member having been at the last step of Column AA of the salary schedule for<br/>a period of at least three years shall be eligible for a salary longevity increment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who moves from Column A to Column AA, after having been at<br/>Step 12 in Column A for a period of years, shall be entitled to those years as credit<br/>toward the longevity increment.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increment shall be based upon certification by the immediate supervisor. A<br/>unit member obtaining a satisfactory rating on each of the official evaluations done<br/>during the immediately preceding three-year period for unit members in Column A,<br/>and three-year period of unit members in Column AA, shall be granted a longevity<br/>increment for each succeeding three years of service to the District.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who receives the first longevity salary increment shall be required to<br/>maintain a satisfactory rating on the official evaluation and undertake and complete<br/>a minimum of three semester units of collegiate work prior to being granted any<br/>subsequent increment. College work must relate to the unit member's chosen<br/>major/minor fields, be in professional education course(s), or have the approval of<br/>the superintendent. The evaluation of collegiate work or the equivalent shall be<br/>done by the superintendent.</p>
<p>1. If the unit member does not agree with the decision of the superintendent, an<br/>appeal may be made to the Professional Standards Committee, which shall assist<br/>and advise the superintendent in the evaluation of this college-equivalent work<br/>in accordance with the regular procedures of that committee, in order that the<br/>acceptance or not of such work may be determined.</p>
<p>F. The longevity increments shall be three (3) percent for each increment.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>1 increment</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> increment<br/>3<sup>rd</sup> increment</p>
<p>/ith</p>
<p>3% of AA12</p>
<p>3% of 1<sup>st</sup> longevity increment<br/>3% of 2<sup>nd</sup> longevity increment<br/>4<sup>m</sup> increment &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3<sup>rd</sup> longevity increment</p>
<p>etc. for each following increment, not to exceed longevity step 8 (eight) on<br/>the Certificated Salary Schedule, and step 12 (twelve) on the Psychologist Salary<br/>Schedule.</p>

<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1, 2013 - June 30. 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each PUSD High School with a 9<sup>th</sup> -12<sup>th</sup> grade enrollment of 150 or more will be<br/>allocated a minimum of eight district-paid coaching stipends equal to 6.5% of<br/>column C, step 0 of the certificated salary schedule. High schools with a 9<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th<br/></sup>grade enrollment under 150 shall be allocated a minimum of six such stipends.<br/>Principals shall, prior to the start of the Fall athletic season, identify at least one<br/>male and one female stipend sport per season. Any sports offered in addition to<br/>those allocated a stipend may be coached by unpaid volunteers who have been<br/>approved by the Governing Board. In the event of a certificated layoff in which<br/>certificated employees are released from their employment with PUSD/PCOE,<br/>these stipends may be unilaterally suspended by the district in the year immediately<br/>following the layoff.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that playoff contests or playoff tournaments occur in a sport, the coach<br/>will be compensated with a playoff stipend equal to .5 % (1/2 of 1%) of column D,<br/>step 0 of the certificated salary schedule for each additional playoff contest or<br/>tournament in which the team participates. In the event of a certificated layoff in<br/>which certificated employees are released from their employment with<br/>PUSD/PCOE, playoff stipends may be unilaterally suspended by the district in the<br/>year immediately following the layoff.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>A football season ends; the team qualifies for a playoff game or two playoff games.<br/>Playing one playoff game would allow the coach one playoff stipend. Playing two<br/>successive games would qualify the coach for two playoff stipends.</p>
<p>Basketball regular season ends (18 or 20 games); team qualifies for post-season<br/>NSCIF championship play; coach receives a playoff stipend. If they win and go on<br/>to the next level, the coach earns another playoff stipend.</p>
<p>Volleyball, baseball, and softball: Same as basketball.</p>
<p>Soccer: One playoff stipend for participating in the finals of the league post season<br/>tournament. Additional playoff stipends for each subsequent playoff game per<br/>level.</p>
<p>C. Wrestling: If a wrestling team or an individual member of a wrestling team qualifies<br/>for CIF competition beyond the sub-section level (i.e. section, state), the wrestling<br/>coach will receive a playoff stipend per level. (Sub-section is considered to be part of<br/>the regular season.) In the event of a certificated layoff in which certificated<br/>employees are released from their employment with PUSD/PCOE, playoff stipends<br/>may be unilaterally suspended by the district in the year immediately following the<br/>layoff.</p>

<p>66</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1,2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>12.01 The Board shall provide health and welfare benefits for the current contract year and</p>
<p>thereafter until changed by negotiation, as defined below:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those unit members whose assignment is 30 hours or more per week must enroll in<br/>the District sponsored life, salary protection, vision, and dental plans. If the<br/>employee has other group medical coverage he or she may elect to not participate<br/>in a medical plan. If the employee does not have other group medical coverage, he<br/>or she must enroll in one of the District sponsored medical plans.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members whose assignment is 15 hours or more per week must enroll in the<br/>District paid Salary Protection plan.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members whose assignment is 15 hours or more per week are eligible to<br/>enroll in the District sponsored medical, dental, and vision plans.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members whose assignment is 20 or more hours per week are eligible to<br/>enroll in the District sponsored Basic Life Insurance plan.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the 2004/2005 plan year, dollar savings resulting from full-time unit<br/>members electing not to participate in the District’s medical plans shall be<br/>maintained in a special reserve account, as described in section G. below. The<br/>District shall notify PCTA by July 1 of each school year of the amount in this<br/>special reserve account. PCTA, through negotiations with the District, shall<br/>determine on an annual basis how to allocate the funds in this special account<br/>towards the health and welfare benefit program for the ensuing school year. The<br/>parties intend that specific uses of these funds may include, but not be limited to,<br/>purchasing additional coverage(s), subsidizing existing health plan premiums,<br/>reducing potential co-pays of employed unit members or reimbursing co-pays of<br/>employed unit members. No unit member shall receive “cash-back” other than co¬<br/>pay reimbursement.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dollar savings”, as used in section 12.01 F above, shall be determined as follows:<br/>If a full-time PCTA unit member (1.0 FTE) does not participate in a medical plan per<br/>subsection 12.01 A, the District will place in the reserve account described in section</p>
<p>12.01 F an amount equal to the cap less the annual premium for the required<br/>coverages as outlined in Section 12.01 (A). This amount will then be multiplied by<br/>the decimal equivalent of the percentage of the fiscal year that the employee did not<br/>have district medical insurance coverage. This reserve fund shall first become<br/>available for allocation in the 2005/2006 plan year, and shall continue until changed<br/>by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>calculations are to be made)</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drops medical insurance during open enrollment in 2004, and does not re-enroll. District</p>
<p>places $6320 ($8160 Cap Less 1840.08 Required Plans*) into the reserve on July 1, 2005.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B drops medical insurance on November 30, 2004 and does not re-enroll. Employee B does</p>
<p>not participate in medical insurance from December 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005 for a total of 212 days, or<br/>212/364, or .58. District places $3666 (.58 x $6320) into the reserve on July 1, 2005.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C drops medical insurance during open enrollment, 2004, then re-enrolls on March 1, 2005.</p>
<p>Employee C does not participate in medical insurance from July 1, to February 28, for a total of 243<br/>days, or 243/364, or .67. District places $4234 (.67 x $6320) into the reserve on July 1, 2005.</p>
<p>Sample Calculation</p>
<p>Employees non-participating in medical plan only in 2004/2005 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.37</p>
<p>x $6415</p>
<p>Total placed in special reserve on 7/1/05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$105,014</p>
<p>Total available for negotiation on 7/1/05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$105,014</p>
<p>*(Dental, $116.38 + Vision, $18.19 + Life Insurance, $8.00 + Salary protection based on $38,000,<br/>$10.77) = $153.34 per month x 12 = $1840.08 per year</p>
<p>12.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-Payment Calculation.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All insured employees will pay a monthly co-payment equal to the total cost of<br/>combined premiums minus the District contribution CAP (prorated as defined in<br/>Section 12.02 B) on District paid benefits. The district contribution cap for<br/>2009/2010 will be $11,059. This amount shall continue as the contribution cap<br/>unless changed through negotiated agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision for a cap on district paid health and welfare benefits will remain in<br/>effect for all future years unless changed by negotiated agreement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members who work at least 3 hours per day but less than full-time (1 FTE)<br/>shall receive the prorated amount of the cap applied first to the Salary Protection<br/>Plan, then the Dental Plan, then the Vision and Life Plans, then the Medical Plan.</p>
<p>12.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a unit member resign or go on leave at the end of a school year, he or she shall be<br/>entitled to continued coverage under the health and welfare benefit until August 31 of<br/>each year.</p>
<p>12.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are absent on account of illness, accident, quarantine, injury, or<br/>pregnancy, and who have exhausted their accumulated sick leave shall receive the same<br/>health and welfare benefits they received prior to the onset of the illness, accident,<br/>quarantine, injury, or pregnancy for a period not to exceed three (3) months from the date</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1, 2013 - June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>of exhaustion of sick leave, or until the unit member qualifies for disability, whichever<br/>comes first.</p>
<p>NOTE: Pregnancy may be covered by disability income protection. Check with your<br/>insurance carrier.</p>
<p>12.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued Coverage</p>
<p>(See Employee Handbook/Health Protection Plan for specific details.)</p>
<p>A. Any unit member separating from the District may elect to continue fringe benefit<br/>insurance coverage under the District plans by making payments for premiums as<br/>per federal COBRA requirements (including up to 2% administrative fee as<br/>allowed by COBRA).</p>
<p>12.06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the death of an employee, the surviving spouse and/or dependents shall<br/>continue to be eligible for all benefits provided under this section for up to thirty-six (36)<br/>months at their own cost. This eligibility is limited by the provisions of COBRA<br/>legislation.</p>
<p>12.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that a unit member, upon retirement, will be expected to pay the same<br/>deductible for benefit programs as is in effect for all other unit members at the date of<br/>his/her retirement. It is further understood that retired unit members will assume the<br/>same obligations or benefit when the deductible amounts for health and welfare benefits<br/>are changed for unit members through negotiations.</p>
<p>12.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quarterly accounting of the group medical experience in relation to the previous year<br/>shall be available to unit members.</p>

<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1.2013-June 30,2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>SECTION 13 - OPTIONAL PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>13.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the policy of the Plumas Unified School District to permit unit members to<br/>reduce their work load from full-time to part-time and have their retirement benefits<br/>based on full-time employment.</p>
<p>13.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for this program, the unit member shall have the following qualifications:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet the years-of-service requirement established by the California State Teachers<br/>Retirement System.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attained the age of 55 prior to the beginning of the school year or term in which the<br/>reduction in service begins. It shall be the unit member's responsibility to initiate<br/>the request for reduced service.</p>
<p>13.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement or contract for reduced services shall be executed by the unit member and<br/>the Board, in writing, on a form similar to Section 13.14, prior to the period of reduced<br/>service at the beginning of the school year or before the beginning of the second half of<br/>the school year. It shall include a job description, duties, hours, location or locations at<br/>which services are to be performed and the duration of participation in the program. The<br/>agreement can be revoked only with the mutual consent of the unit member and the<br/>Board by the execution of a form similar to Section 13.15.</p>
<p>Applications should be received at least three months prior to the proposed date of</p>
<p>change in service.</p>
<p>13.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assignment shall require service based on consecutive hours or periods in the school</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>13.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced service shall be at least a minimum of one-half of the number of days of service<br/>required by the unit member's contract of employment during the final year of service in<br/>a full-time position. Agreements with beginning dates other than the start of the school<br/>year shall require the unit member to serve at least one-half time for the remainder of that<br/>school year. Minimum salary paid shall be equal to no less than one-half time service.</p>
<p>13.06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced service may be on a daily schedule or full-time for at least one-half year. The<br/>unit member shall be paid a salary which is the pro rata share of the salary he/she would<br/>be earning had he/she not elected to exercise the option of part-time employment. He/she<br/>shall retain all other rights and benefits for which he/she or the Board makes the<br/>payments, including those as provided in Section 53201 of the Government Code, that<br/>would be required if he/she remained in full-time employment.</p>
<p>Reduced service assignments must be initiated by the unit member without coercion by<br/>the employer.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>PCTA Bilateral Agreement<br/>July 1.2013-June 30, 2015<br/>Edit 7/1/2014</p>
<p>13.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This option of reduced service is limited to pre-kindergarten through grade 12 to unit<br/>members who do not hold positions with salaries above that of a school principal.</p>
<p>13.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time service is limited to a period not to exceed five years, and no unit members<br/>shall participate after attaining the age of 65. Any unit member in the program who<br/>reaches age 65 during the school year may continue the reduced service for the balance of<br/>that year.</p>
<p>13.09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board reserves the right to deny granting a reduced work load to any unit member, if<br/>doing so would create difficult staffing problems.</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member and Board agree to submit contributions to the State Teachers<br/>Retirement System based on the compensation which would be earned for full-time<br/>employment.</p>
<p>13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full retirement credit is not earned until the end of the full school term or full school<br/>year. Participants who terminate prior to these concluding periods will receive retirement<br/>credit based on the salary actually paid in the proportion that it relate to the annual salary<br/>that would have been paid had the employment continued.</p>
<p>13.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request termination of the agreement.

It is recognized that democratic values can best be transmitted in<br/>an atmosphere which is fee from censorship* and in which academic freedom for the<br/>teacher and student is encouraged.

<p>20.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is mutually recognized that freedom carries with it responsibility; academic freedom<br/>also carries with it academic responsibility. Discussion and analysis of controversial<br/>issues should be conducted within the framework of the fundamental values of the<br/>community as a whole as they are expressed in the educational philosophy and objectives<br/>of the Board.</p>
<p>20.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the frame of reference set forth in Section 20.03, and as it pertains to the course to<br/>which a teacher is assigned, academic freedom in the schools is defined as:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right of teachers to a free expression of conscience as private citizens with the<br/>responsibility of a professional presentation of balanced views relating to<br/>controversial issues within the context of the course being taught. It is understood<br/>that teachers shall not use the classroom as a vehicle to promote personal beliefs.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility to use materials which are relevant to the levels of ability and<br/>maturity of the students and consistent with the adopted District course of study<br/>and reading lists.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of teachers to allow students to hold divergent ideas as long as<br/>the expression of dissent is done within the guidelines of debate and discussion<br/>which are generally acceptable in a normal classroom environment.</p>
