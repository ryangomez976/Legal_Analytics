<p>It is the purpose of the Memorandum of Agreement to set forth the full, complete,<br/>and entire understanding of the parties reached as a result of meeting and<br/>conferring regarding wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment<br/>of the employees covered hereby.</p>
<p>The Articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) by and between the Governing Board of the Tipton<br/>Elementary School District (&quot;Board&quot;) and the Associated Teachers of<br/>Tipton/Califomia Teachers Association/National Education Association<br/>(&quot;Association&quot;), an employee organization.</p>
<p>RECOGNITION AND SCOPE OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The District recognizes the Association as the representative of its members for a</p>
<p>unit of all Certificated Employees excluding Management, Supervisory,</p>
<p>Confidential, Substitutes, and Part-Time Teachers for the purpose of meeting and</p>
<p>conferring on matters within the scope of the Memorandum of Agreement.</p>

<p>Tipton/CTA/NEA, or who has applied for membership, may sign<br/>and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of<br/>unified membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments<br/>in the Association. Pursuant to such authorization, the District will<br/>deduct one tenth (1/10) of such dues from the regular salary check<br/>of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions<br/>for unit members who sign such authorization after the<br/>commencement of the school year shall be appropriately prorated<br/>to complete payments by the end of the school year. Any unit<br/>member hired after July 1, 1999, who is not a member of the<br/>Associated Teachers of Tipton/CTA/NEA, or who does not make<br/>application for membership within thirty (30) calendar days from<br/>the date of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining<br/>unit, shall become a member of the Association or pay to the<br/>Association a fee in an amount equal to unified membership dues,</p>

There shall be no charge to the<br/>Association for such mandatory agency fee deduction.</p>

Such<br/>proof shall be presented on or before October 31 of<br/>each school year. The Association shall have the<br/>right of inspection in order to review said proof of<br/>payment.</p>

<p>2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 2.2.2 above, whether for membership dues or agency fee, the<br/>District agrees promptly to remit such monies to the Association<br/>accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members for whom such<br/>deductions have been made, categorizing them as to membership or non¬<br/>membership in the Association, and indicating any changes in personnel<br/>from the list previously furnished.</p>
<p>2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agrees to furnish any information needed by the District</p>
<p>to fulfill the provisions of the Article.</p>

<p>2.2.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to pay to the District all legal fees<br/>and legal costs incurred by the District in defending against<br/>any court actions and/or administrative action before the<br/>Public Employment Relations Board challenging the<br/>legality or constitutionality of the agency fee provisions of<br/>the Agreement or implementation thereof, provided that the<br/>Association shall have exclusive right to decide and<br/>determine whether any such action shall be compromised,<br/>resisted, defended, tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>2.2.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall indemnify and hold harmless the<br/>District, its officers, agents and employees from any award<br/>or compromise of damages or liability arising out of any<br/>court action and/or administrative action before the Public<br/>Employment Relations Board challenging the legality or</p>
<p>Tipton Elementary School District</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>2012-2013</p>
<p>constitutionality of the agency fee provisions of the<br/>Agreement (or their implementation) provided that the<br/>Association shall have the exclusive right to decide and<br/>determine whether any such actions or proceedings referred<br/>to shall be compromised, resisted, defended, tried, or<br/>appealed.</p>
<p>2.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher not a member of the Associated Teachers of Tipton/</p>
<p>CTA/NEA on the effective date of this Agreement shall be exempt from<br/>this provision.</p>

It<br/>is further agreed that nothing herein shall prohibit such employees from representing themselves<br/>individually, or appearing in their own behalf, in their employment relations with the District.</p>
<p>No employees shall be interfered with, intimidated, restrained, coerced, or discriminated against<br/>because of the exercise of these rights.</p>

<p>2012-2013</p>
<p>7.9</p>
<p>7.10</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave (Ed. Code Section 44981): Any days of leave of<br/>absence for illness or injury (sick leave) allowed pursuant to Ed Code Section<br/>44978 may be used by the employee, at his/her election, in cases of personal<br/>necessity.

<p>Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>7.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is, or whose family member is, suffering from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury may request donations of accrued sick<br/>leave credits under the catastrophic leave program.</p>
<p>7.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illness”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“injury” means an illness or injury that is</p>
<p>expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of<br/>time, or that incapacitates a member of the employee’s family<br/>which incapacity requires the employee to take time off from work<br/>for an extended period of time to care for that family member, and<br/>taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the<br/>employee because he/she has exhausted all of his/her sick leave<br/>and other paid time off. Members of the employee’s family that<br/>are included for this leave include spouse, children, and parents.</p>
<p>7.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requesting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under this program, the employee shall</p>
<p>provide verification of the catastrophic injury or illness.<br/>Verification shall be made by means of a letter, dated and signed<br/>by the sick or injured person’s physician, indicating the<br/>incapacitating nature and probable duration of the illness or injury.</p>
<p>7.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall determine:</p>
<p>7.10.4.1 That the employee is unable to work due to the</p>
<p>Tipton Elementary School District</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>2012-2013</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8:</p>
<p>8.1</p>
<p>8.2</p>
<p>employee’s or his/her family member’s catastrophic<br/>illness or injury, and;</p>
<p>7.10.4.2 That the employee has exhausted all accrued paid<br/>leave credits.</p>
<p>7.10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above verification and determinations are made, the</p>
<p>District may approve the transfer of accrued sick leave credits.</p>
<p>7.10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or designee shall inform employees of the</p>
<p>means by which donations may be made in response to the<br/>employee’s request.</p>
<p>7.10.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written notice to the District, may donate no</p>
<p>more than two (2) accrued sick leave credits to the requesting<br/>employee at a minimum of one (1) day and full day increments<br/>thereafter.
