Such<br/>proof shall be presented within thirty (30) days of the unit member’s first duty day of each school year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member making payments as set forth in Sections 6 and 7 above, who requests<br/>that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement be used in his or her behalf, shall be<br/>responsible for paying the reasonable cost of using such procedures. The Association retains the right to<br/>determine as to whether to proceed to the arbitration level.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District, pursuant to Sections 1, 2, or 3 above,<br/>the District shall promptly remit such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list<br/>categorizing the payments as membership dues or agency fees, and indicating any changes in personnel<br/>from the previous list.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the<br/>provisions of this Article.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether<br/>any such action or proceeding referred to in Section 11(A) above shall or shall not be compromised,<br/>resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>

<p>6</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “Grievance” is a formal written claim by a grievant that there has been a<br/>violation, misapplication or misinterpretation of a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “Grievant” may be the Association or any unit member.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “Day” is a day that a unit member is regularly scheduled to be on duty.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Immediate Supervisor” is the lowest level administrator having jurisdiction<br/>over the grievant and who has been designated to adjust grievances.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to Representation. The Grievant shall have the right to have an Association<br/>Representative present at all levels of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level. Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant will attempt,<br/>within five (5) school days, to resolve the problem by informally conferencing with his/her immediate<br/>supervisor/designee. For issues that cannot be reasonably resolved at the site level or which involve<br/>multiple sites, the informal conference may occur at the District office level through the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Human Resources or designee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level.</p>
<p>Level I. Within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to<br/>the grievance, or after the grievant knew or reasonably should have known of such act or omission, if the<br/>grievant desires to pursue the matter further, the grievant must present his/her grievance in writing on the<br/>appropriate form to his/her immediate supervisor. This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of<br/>the grievance, the circumstances involved, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall communicate his/her decision to the grievant in writing within<br/>fifteen (15) days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does not respond within the time limits. <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>11</p>
<p>the grievant may appeal to the next level. Either the grievant, or the supervisor, or his/her designee may<br/>request a personal conference within the above time limits.</p>
<p>Level II. If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, he/she may, within<br/>the earlier of fifteen (15) days of the date of the decision or the date the decision was due, appeal on the<br/>appropriate form to the Superintendent, or his/her designee.</p>
<p>This statement shall include a copy of the original grievance, the decision rendered (if<br/>any), and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the appeal. Either the grievant, or the<br/>Superintendent, or his/her designee may request a personal conference within the above time limits.</p>
<p>The Superintendent, or his/her designee, shall communicate his/her decision to the<br/>grievant within fifteen (15) days. If the Superintendent, or his/her designee, does not respond within the<br/>time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the next level. If the grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>disposition of his/her grievance at Level II, or if no written decision has been rendered within fifteen<br/>(15) days after the grievant has filed a written appeal to the Superintendent, the grievant may<br/>immediately request in writing to the Association that the Association submit the grievance to<br/>arbitration.</p>
<p>Level III. The Association, by written notice to the Superintendent within five (5) days<br/>after a decision by the Superintendent, or his/her designee, or the expiration of the time for a decision,<br/>may submit the grievance to final and binding arbitration. The determination as to whether to proceed to<br/>arbitration shall be in the sole discretion of the Association. If any question arises as to the arbitrability<br/>of the grievance, such question will be ruled upon by the Arbitrator only after he/she has had an<br/>opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>The parties shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator. Should they be unable to agree on an<br/>arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of the Association’s submission of the grievance to arbitration, the<br/>District or the Association shall request the State Mediation and Conciliation Service, or the American</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Arbitration Association to provide a list of seven (7) arbitrators. The party that requests this list of<br/>arbitrators shall pay for the costs incurred in obtaining this list. From this list of arbitrators, the parties<br/>shall strike alternately until only one (1) name remains, who shall be the arbitrator. The first strike shall<br/>be determined by the flip of a coin. Thereafter, the arbitration shall proceed under the Voluntary Labor<br/>Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall render a final and binding decision which will be in writing and will<br/>set forth his/her findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator will<br/>be without power or authority to make any decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited<br/>by law or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be<br/>submitted to the Superintendent and the Association.</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem<br/>expenses, his/her travel and subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing shall be borne equally by<br/>the Board and the Association. All other costs shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial Review. Level III does not preclude either party from pursuing available legal<br/>processes after the exhaustion of the grievance procedure herein.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Reprisal. No reprisals shall be taken against any party participating in the Grievance<br/>Procedure herein by the Association or the District.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Rights. Prior to the resolution of a grievance at Levels I and II above, the<br/>Association shall receive a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and shall be given the<br/>opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release Time. Release time shall be provided the grievant and one (1) Association<br/>representative outside the grievant’s instructional day at a time when mutually agreed to by the grievant<br/>and the management employee involved at any level excepting Level III, when release time shall be<br/>granted during the instructional day if necessary.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms. Grievance forms shall be prepared by the District and will be made available to<br/>unit members at the immediate supervisor’s office. Supervisor’s receiving grievances will immediately<br/>contact the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or Designee. Grievance forms will be filed in<br/>a central file in the District office. Grievance forms will be updated and/or reviewed prior to each new<br/>contract.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Resolution. In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be<br/>processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school year, and if left<br/>unresolved until the beginning of the following school year could result in harm to a grievant, the time<br/>limits set forth herein may be reduced by mutual agreement of the parties in interest so that the<br/>procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year, or as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Line Changes. The parties may mutually agree in writing to change or delay<br/>timelines in this Article. Any extension of timelines must be in writing and signed by both the grievant<br/>and the District representative. The failure of the grievant to follow the timelines for filing a grievance<br/>and advancing it to the next level is jurisdictional and shall constitute a waiver of the right to proceed<br/>with the grievance. If the District representative fails to respond to a grievance within the timelines, the<br/>grievance is deemed denied on the date the response is due and the grievant may advance the grievance<br/>to the next level.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>HOURS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Workday. Except for psychologists, counselors, teachers on special<br/>assignment and nurses, unit members shall be on campus and responsible for instructional and other<br/>assigned duties for seven (7) continuous hours per day inclusive of a lunch period, unless mutually<br/>agreed to by the unit member and the building principal. Psychologists, counselors, teachers on special<br/>assignment, speech therapists, and nurses are required to work an eight (8) hour day, inclusive of a lunch<br/>period. However, they may leave the work site upon completion of a seven and one half (7!4&gt;) hour<br/>workday provided that the unit member, as determined by his/her professional judgment, has completed<br/>his/her work assignment or unless requested to remain by the unit member’s immediate supervisor for a<br/>staff meeting, in service training or parent/staff conferences.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Professional Assignments. Unit members will be responsible for professional<br/>assignments required by management in addition to activities directly related to a unit member’s primary<br/>assignment, including but not limited to program development, professional growth activities, committee<br/>assignments, faculty and District meetings, back to school and open house nights and special help to<br/>students. Unit members will provide, at no compensation, supervision at two (2) District authorized<br/>activities held outside the unit member’s regular workday. Each of the following events shall constitute<br/>one Activity: Varsity football game, Junior Varsity football game, Freshman football game, other similar<br/>athletic activities, a wrestling meet, a track meet and a school recognized club sponsored activity. The<br/>District will post all Activities on the Intranet for bargaining unit members to view. Additionally,<br/>bargaining unit members may sign up for other schools’ events. A unit member will be credited with<br/>having supervised an activity if they arrive at an activity that has been cancelled and the unit member<br/>was not previously notified of the cancellation. An activity will equal supervision at an after school<br/>activity for up to three hours. Activities supervised after these two (2) will be compensated for as</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>follows: Each activity of approximately three (3) hours in length shall be equal to the rate paid to the<br/>unit member for substituting for one (1) class period. Activities of more than three (3) hours that go into<br/>a fourth (4th) hour shall be paid at the rate of two (2) class periods for up to six (6) hours. Activities of<br/>more than six (6) hours shall be paid at the rate of three (3) class periods for up to nine (9) hours, and<br/>similar payments for longer periods. Such activities will include: athletic events, dances, concerts,<br/>plays, graduation and promotion and other similar activities, including but not limited to those sponsored<br/>by ASB. All unit members shall have an opportunity to indicate their preference for their assignments<br/>before the District may make supervision assignments based on need. Supervision assignments are to be<br/>offered District wide to all unit members so long as one-half of the supervisory staff is from the host<br/>school.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch Period. Unit members may have at least a forty five (45) minute lunch period, of<br/>which at least thirty (30) minutes shall be duty free, except where the District and the Association agree<br/>to an adjustment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching Periods Per Dav.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members with classroom assignments shall not be required to teach more<br/>than five (5) periods per day. (The ASB Directors, at the comprehensive high schools will be required to<br/>teach two periods in addition to their ASB assignment. The ASB Directors shall be entitled to a<br/>conference period as set forth below.) However, if a school site has an extended day, then the unit<br/>members with classroom assignments may be required to teach six (6) periods per day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is required by administration to period sub during their prep<br/>period, then they will be compensated at the rate of $34.90 for any period subbing during the length of<br/>this contract. Period sub-pay will be increased by the overall percentage rate applied to the salary<br/>schedule, non-retroactive, rounded up to the nearest nickel. Site administration will keep and use an<br/>equitable rotation list. Non-classroom unit members will be asked to period sub and will receive the</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>same compensation listed above for each period they are asked to sub (with the understanding that they,<br/>like other unit members, will make up the time they period sub consistent with their professional<br/>responsibilities).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference Periods. All full-time unit members with classroom teaching assignments<br/>shall have at least five (5) periods per week for preparation and planning and other assigned duties.<br/>However, under no circumstances shall a unit member be required to use their scheduled conference<br/>period for a lunch period. No ground supervision shall be assigned outside the workday.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Preparations. Unit members shall have not more than three (3) preparations per day<br/>unless agreed to in writing by the unit member. A “preparation” is defined to be a specific unit of<br/>instruction as defined in the curriculum guide with a specified course number and intended to be<br/>delivered to a student or students by a teacher. Examples of classes that will be considered as<br/>“preparations” include a credit recovery class and “advanced” courses. “Preparation” does not include<br/>special education collaborations. Teacher Assistant (“T/A”) does not constitute a class or prep.<br/>However, if maintaining this limit would require the District to hire additional personnel, a unit member<br/>may be required to have one (1) additional preparation. Where more than three (3) preparations are<br/>agreed to, upon request, a unit member shall be given written justification.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workdays Per Year.</p>
<p>A. Unless otherwise specified (i.e., psychologists, counselors, etc.) the number of<br/>workdays for unit members shall be one hundred eighty-four (184) days. For the 2014-15 school year<br/>only, two (2) additional professional development days will thereby increase the work-year and salary<br/>schedules by the per diem value for all association members according to their respective salary<br/>schedule. First year personnel may be required to work a minimum of one (1) additional pre-service day<br/>at the hourly rate. The work year shall include no more than one hundred eighty (180) days of student<br/>attendance. On the day planned for teacher check out/prep day, unit members will be permitted to leave</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>campus when check out/prep has been completed, and check out procedure will be available from 8:00</p>
<p>A.M. to 3:00 P.M., exclusive of lunch.</p>
<p>B. At the end of the first semester for grades 9-12, three (3) two hundred forty-five<br/>(245) minute instructional days will be scheduled for the conduct of final examinations and final<br/>examination grading. At the end of the second semester, three (3) two hundred forty-five (245) minute<br/>instructional days will be scheduled for grades 9-12 to conduct final examinations and final examination<br/>grading. However, due to funding restrictions, the Community Day School will not have minimum<br/>days.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Calendar.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should emergencies arise after negotiations have taken place that impinge upon<br/>the negotiations, the District shall contact the Association to negotiate the matter.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree to meet and negotiate any necessary<br/>adjustments to the calendar to meet minimum state requirements pertaining to days and/or minutes of<br/>student attendance which entitle the District to receive maximum state support. Currently, the minimum<br/>minutes required by the State are:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,800/year for the comprehensive high schools;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54,000/year for middle schools;</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;360/day, without counting passing or breaks, for Community Day School.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-Time Teaching.</p>
<p>A. Unit members wanting to go on less than a full-time teaching schedule shall<br/>apply in writing to the District in advance of the intended time they desire to go on a part time teaching<br/>schedule. The request shall also specify the desired schedule, which shall be mutually agreed upon. For<br/>individuals desiring to go to part-time teaching, preliminary notification must be given to the District no<br/>later than March 15. The District shall give the unit member a tentative response in writing within thirty</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>(30) days of receiving the unit member’s request. The District must provide a final response to the<br/>request by June 1. Notwithstanding the above, if the unit member and the District are able to mutually<br/>agree to a part-time schedule prior to the 1st instructional day at that site, then the unit member will be<br/>placed on that schedule. Part-time certificated unit members shall be compensated at a rate equal to one<br/>fifth (1/5) their normal salary for each period assigned derived from the placement of the unit member<br/>on the regular salary schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to Full-Time Teaching. Bargaining unit members shall be entitled to<br/>resume a full-time schedule at their discretion for the following school year, so long as they provide the<br/>District written notice prior to May 15. The District may return a unit member on less than a full-time<br/>teaching schedule to a full-time teaching schedule upon written notification to that unit member so long<br/>as it is sent by June 1.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro Rata Benefits and Professional Responsibility. Bargaining unit members<br/>who receive part-time teaching assignments shall be provided wages, benefits and paid leave equal to<br/>their percentage of service. For example, a teacher who is teaching eighty percent (80%) of that<br/>teaching day would receive payment by the District equal to eighty percent (80%) of that provided to a<br/>full-time teacher for their actual elected insurance costs. The part-time teacher will be required to pay<br/>the remainder of the cost through payroll deduction. Part-time unit members will be available for<br/>reasonable professional responsibilities as determined by their immediate supervisor. Bargaining unit<br/>members considering a part-time schedule should consult with STRS about any possible effects this type<br/>of schedule may have on their retirement.</p>
<p>10. Job Sharing.</p>
<p>Definition: Job sharing shall refer to two (2) unit members on regular contracts sharing<br/>one (1) teaching assignment. Two (2) unit members shall share an assignment for a minimum of one (1)</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>Applications for a job sharing assignment for the following school year shall be filed with<br/>the District no later than March 1. Applications shall not be denied except for cause. The Board shall<br/>approve or deny the request and notify, in writing, the Human Resources office, principal, and the<br/>applicants of its decision by May 30. If the decision is denied, the applicants shall be notified, in<br/>writing, of the specific reasons for the denial.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, job sharing unit members’ wages,<br/>benefits, and paid leaves shall be prorated relative to the actual time worked. In no event shall the total<br/>amount of health and welfare benefits for the job sharers exceed the amount the District would have paid<br/>if the position had not been shared. Thus, unit members will pay the difference through payroll<br/>deduction. Each job sharing unit member shall receive salary schedule increments.</p>
<p>Upon requests of the two (2) unit members, a job sharing assignment may be renewed<br/>provided the two (2) unit members notify the District prior to March 1. In the event the two (2) unit<br/>members fail to notify the District of their desire to continue the job sharing assignment, or in the event<br/>the District does not approve the continuance of the assignment, the unit members shall be returned to<br/>full time assignments.</p>
<p>If a unit member on a regular contract is in a job-sharing assignment and elects to return<br/>after the first year to full time teaching, the unit member will be returned, whenever possible, to his/her<br/>original school. If a unit member on a regular contract is in a job sharing assignment for more than one<br/>(1) year and elects to return to full time teaching, the unit member will be assigned to the first available<br/>full time teaching position for which he/she is certificated and competent and in conformance with the<br/>provisions of this agreement.</p>

<p>LEAVES</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope of Article. The benefits which are expressly provided by this Article X are the sole<br/>leave benefits which are part of this Agreement, and it is agreed that other statutory or regulatory leave<br/>benefits are not incorporated, either directly or impliedly, into this Agreement. However, nothing in this<br/>section shall preclude unit members from requesting leave pursuant to statutory provisions governing<br/>leaves not herein mentioned. The mandatory leave provisions of Education Code Sections 44978-</p>
<p>44987.3 are expressly included herein by this reference.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Illness and Injury Leave.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave. Unit members shall be entitled to ten (10) days of paid sick leave per<br/>school year of employment. Unit members who are less than full time unit members shall be entitled to<br/>a pro rata amount of sick leave proportionate to a full time unit member.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub Differential Sick Leave. This section applies only to unit members who have<br/>exhausted all available sick leave. Employees who are absent for more than three (3) periods in a school<br/>day will have the cost of a full day sub deducted from their paycheck. Employees who are absent for<br/>three (3) periods or less will have the cost of a half day sub deducted. This sub-differential pay is only<br/>available when the absence is for the unit members’ illness or injury, not absence due to a family<br/>members’ illness or injury.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in “A”<br/>above in any school year, the amount not utilized shall accrue from school year to school year.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A unit member’s sick leave shall only be deducted on an hourly basis.<br/>(Teachers, project specialists and librarians can convert their hours to days by dividing the total hours by<br/>7, and counselors, speech therapists, nurses and psychologists can convert their hours to days by<br/>dividing the total hours by 8.)</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>(2) It is the unit members’ responsibility to contact the Human Resources<br/>office about the transfer of sick leave to or from their previous or new districts.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit member will contact the District to provide notice of<br/>absence, in the manner prescribed by the District, as soon as possible and no later than one and one half<br/>(1-1/2) hours before the beginning of the unit member’s workday. The District will assume a unit<br/>member will return to work after a day of absence, unless otherwise notified prior to one (1) hour before<br/>the end of the unit member’s work day at that member’s site.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an absence of five (5) consecutive days, for good cause, a unit member may<br/>be requested by District management to present a medical doctor’s certificate verifying the personal<br/>illness or injury and/or a medical authorization to return to work.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For good cause, the District may at its expense, and at any time, require a unit<br/>member to be examined by a certified medical specialist, who shall report to the Superintendent or<br/>designee.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members should continue to schedule medical appointments<br/>outside of work hours to minimize the disruption to the educational program and services; however, in<br/>accordance with the unit member attendance system, the District will permit the use of sick leave for<br/>medical appointments.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave Use for Immediate Family. Employees may use up to five (5) days of their<br/>annual sick leave accrual for the purpose of taking care of sick parents, step-parents, children, step¬<br/>children, spouse or registered domestic partner. All limitations on the use of sick leave for the<br/>employee’s own illness or injury as set out in Section 2 apply to the employee’s use of this leave.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity and Personal Discretion Leave.</p>
<p>A. Earned leave for illness or injury may be used, at the unit member’s election, for<br/>purposes of personal necessity or personal discretion as defined below, provided that use of such leave</p>
<p>does not exceed ten (10) days in any school year. An employee who has used up all sick leave is not<br/>entitled to Personal Necessity or Personal Discretion Leave.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this provision, personal necessity shall be limited to five (5) days<br/>for the following: (1) death or serious illness of a member of the unit member’s immediate family as<br/>defined in Bereavement Leave below, or attending the funeral of a relative; (2) an accident involving the<br/>unit member’s person or property, or the person or property of a unit member’s immediate family; and</p>
<p>(3) other personal necessities which are serious in nature, involve circumstances the unit member cannot<br/>reasonably ignore, and require the unit member’s attention during normal working hours. Such leave<br/>may not be used for the extension of a holiday or a vacation, or for recreational activities, but may be<br/>used to appear in court as a litigant or for paternity leave.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using personal necessity leave, a unit member shall submit reasonable<br/>verification as requested by the District.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this provision, personal discretion leave will be limited to five (5)<br/>days based solely upon verification by the unit member that the reason for the leave is serious in nature,<br/>involves circumstances the unit member cannot reasonably ignore, and requires the unit member’s<br/>attention during normal working hours.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall make every effort to comply with District procedures to<br/>enable the District to secure a substitute.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with the requirements set forth above, unit members may also take<br/>personal necessity or personal discretion leave as set forth in Labor Code section 230.7 to appear in<br/>school on behalf of their child who is subject to a disciplinary matter. Unpaid leave may also be<br/>available for this purpose.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Bereavement Leave.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Education Code section 44985, a unit member shall be entitled to a<br/>leave of absence, not to exceed three (3) days, or five (5) days if out of state travel is required, without<br/>loss of salary, or sick leave deduction on account of the death of any member of his/her “immediate<br/>family” or person living in the immediate household.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this provision, immediate family is limited to mother, father,<br/>grandmother, grandfather, or a grandchild, stepmother or stepfather of the unit member or of the spouse<br/>of the unit member, and the spouse, registered domestic partner, son, son in law, daughter, daughter in<br/>law, stepchild, brother or sister of the unit member, or any other relative living in the immediate<br/>household of the unit member. Unit members should contact the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources or Designee if they have questions regarding this provision.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall require the use of bereavement leave before personal necessity<br/>leave days are used for the purposes allowed in this section.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice to the District is required in accordance with the provisions relating to sick<br/>leave. Further, as soon as reasonably possible a bereavement leave form shall be submitted to Human<br/>Resources at the District Office.</p>
<p>6. Pregnancy. Paternity or Adoption.</p>
<p>A. Unit members are entitled to use sick leave as set forth in the provisions for<br/>personal illness and injury leave for disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, or<br/>childbirth on the same terms and conditions as those governing leaves of absence for other illness, injury<br/>or medical disability. The length of such disability leave, including the date on which the leave shall<br/>commence and the date on which the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the unit member<br/>and the unit member’s physician. This information shall be set forth in a letter, or District approved<br/>form, from the unit member’s physician to the Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member on leave for pregnancy disability shall be entitled to return to a<br/>position comparable to that held at the time leave commenced.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also, Section 11.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members can use up to the lesser of ten (10) days or 50% of their unused sick<br/>leave for Paternity or Adoption Leave per fiscal year. Unit members must submit an initial leave request<br/>to Human Resources at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the first day of the requested leave. The<br/>request must include reasonable verification of the paternity or adoption. Leave must be used in a single<br/>block (consecutive workdays), unless there are extenuating circumstances and Human Resources<br/>approves the scheduling of a non-consecutive leave.</p>
<p>7. Industrial Accident Leave.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be entitled to industrial accident leave according to the<br/>provision in Education Code Section 44984 for personal injury which has qualified for Workers’<br/>Compensation under the provisions of applicable state law.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not exceed sixty (60) days during which the schools of the<br/>District are required to be in session, or when the unit member would otherwise have been performing<br/>work for the District in any one (1) fiscal year for the same industrial accident.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District, at its expense, has the right to have the unit member examined by a<br/>certified medical specialist designated by the District to assist in determining the length of time during<br/>which the unit member will be temporarily unable to perform assigned duties and the degree to which a<br/>disability is attributable to the injury involved.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any days of absence from duty as a result of the same industrial accident, the<br/>unit member shall endorse to the District any wage loss benefit check received from any Workers’<br/>Compensation program maintained by the District which would make the total compensation from both</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>sources exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the amount the unit member would have received as<br/>salary had there been no industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial and Jury Duty Leave.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to as many days of paid leave as are necessary for<br/>appearances in any legal proceeding, other than as a litigant, or on jury duty. The unit member will<br/>notify their supervisor of the absence as soon as possible and keep the supervisor informed of any<br/>changes. Verification of the leave may be required.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to paid leave only when subpoenaed as a witness<br/>in any legal proceeding where the unit member is not a party to the proceeding. The unit member will<br/>exert reasonable effort to minimize the amount of time which is required to be taken under this section.<br/>Any order to appear in a legal proceeding which is brought about by any misconduct or connivance by<br/>the unit member shall prohibit the member from the paid leave of absence under this section. The unit<br/>member will contact the person listed on the subpoena to determine time and date of appearance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall assign to the District any and all payments (except mileage<br/>allotment) received while on judicial or jury duty leave when the unit member is excused from regular<br/>duties for such leave.</p>

<p>26</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for such leaves of absence listed in Part A must be in writing and<br/>submitted to the District office at least five (5) days prior to the leave. In addition, a unit member on<br/>such leave shall, by March 1, give the District a preliminary notification regarding intent to return, and<br/>shall notify the District no later than the last day of regular student attendance as to the member’s intent<br/>to return to employment in the District. Failure to so notify will be considered an abandonment of<br/>position. Application for leaves of less than ten (10) days duration must be submitted in writing to the<br/>Superintendent with a copy to the unit member’s immediate supervisor. The Superintendent or the<br/>Superintendent’s designee shall make the final decision regarding such leave.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for a leave, in excess of ten (10) days, shall be decided by the Board of<br/>Trustees and shall be accompanied by a written statement supporting the request. A recommendation<br/>concerning such request may also be submitted by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to make voluntary payments to maintain fringe<br/>benefits, whenever such benefits are not provided for under this Agreement. If the unit member wishes<br/>to continue the benefits at their own expense they must contact the Payroll office.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who is a parent, guardian or grandparent having custody of one or<br/>more children who are enrolled in grades K-12, or who attend a licensed day care facility may be granted<br/>unpaid leave each school year in order to participate in school or day care activities. (In some<br/>circumstances, the leave may qualify as personal necessity leave.) Such leave shall not exceed eight<br/>hours in any month of the school year, and the employee shall give reasonable advance notice of the<br/>absence to their supervisor.</p>
<p>10. Legislative Leave. A unit member who is elected to the State Legislature, Congress, or<br/>elected to hold office for the state or national teachers association shall be entitled to an unpaid leave of<br/>absence for not more than two (2) years.</p>

<p>B. The unit member on legislative leave shall be entitled to return to a comparable<br/>position at the end of such leave.</p>
<p>11. Family and Pregnancy Disability Leave/Transfer Policy. Under the federal Family and<br/>Medical Leave Act of 1993 (“FMLA”) and the California Family Rights Act of 1993 (“CFRA”), if<br/>employees who have more than twelve (12) months of service with the District, have worked at least<br/>1,250 hours in the past twelve (12) months, and are employed at a worksite with fifty (50) or more<br/>employees or the District employs at least fifty (50) employees within seventy five (75) miles of the<br/>employee’s worksite, the employee may have a right to FMLA and/or CFRA leave. If eligible for such<br/>leave, the employee may be entitled to take up to twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid, job protected leave<br/>in a twelve (12) month period for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of the employee’s child;<br/>for the employee’s own serious health condition; or for the care of the employee’s child, parent, or<br/>spouse. At the employee’s or the District’s option, certain kinds of paid and unpaid leave may be<br/>substituted for family leave. Even if the employee is not eligible for FMLA and/or CFRA leave, if<br/>disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition, the employee is entitled to take a<br/>pregnancy disability leave (“PDL”) of up to four months, depending on the employee’s period(s) of<br/>actual disability. If the employee is also FMLA/CFRA eligible, the employee has certain rights to take<br/>BOTH a PDL/FMLA leave and a CFRA leave in connection with the birth of the employee’s child.</p>
<p>When medically necessary, leave may be taken on an intermittent or a reduced work<br/>schedule. If the employee is taking CFRA leave following the birth, adoption, or foster care placement<br/>of a child, the basic minimum duration for such leave is two (2) weeks, and the employee must conclude<br/>the leave within one (1) year of the birth, adoption, or placement for foster care.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>If possible, the employee must provide at least thirty (30) days advance notice for<br/>foreseeable events (such as the expected birth of a child or a planned medical treatment for the employee<br/>or of a family member). For events which are unforeseeable, the employee needs to notify the District,<br/>at least verbally, as soon as the employee learns of the need for the leave. Failure to comply with these<br/>notice requirements is grounds for and may result in deferral of the requested leave.</p>
<p>The District may require certification from the employee’s health care provider before<br/>allowing the employee a leave for pregnancy or the employee’s own serious health condition, or<br/>certification from the health care provider of the employee’s child, parent, or spouse who has a serious<br/>health condition before allowing the employee a leave to take care of that family member. Under certain<br/>circumstances, the District may also require second or third opinions (at the District’s expense) and a<br/>fitness for duty report prior to the employee’s return to work. Where the FMLA and/or CFRA apply, the<br/>District will continue group health plan coverage (if any) for up to a maximum of twelve (12) weeks in<br/>any twelve (12) month period under the same terms and conditions as applied prior to the employee’s<br/>leave of absence. Upon return from leave, most employees must be restored to their original or<br/>equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms. While taking a family<br/>care or pregnancy disability leave may impact certain of the employee’s benefits and the employee’s<br/>seniority date, use of FMLA, CFRA, and/or PDL leave cannot result in the loss of any employment<br/>benefit that accrued prior to the start of the employee’s leave of absence.</p>
<p>For more information and/or a copy of the District’s detailed policies regarding family<br/>leave and/or pregnancy disability leave, please contact the Human Resources office. If any part of the<br/>leave is unpaid, consult STRS.</p>
<p>12. Sabbatical Leave. The Board policy on sabbatical leave is available in the<br/>Superintendent’s office. Eligibility requirements include being a permanent teacher with a minimum of<br/>one hundred fifty (150) days of paid service for each of the prior seven (7) years in the District and</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>serving a minimum of four (4) years in the District upon return from leave. A bond equal to the amount<br/>of compensation the employee will receive during this sabbatical will be provided by the employee to<br/>the District, unless the Board makes an affirmative finding that the interests of the District will be<br/>protected by a written agreement between the employee and the District. See Education Code section<br/>44969.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave. Bargaining unit members may participate in the District’s<br/>catastrophic leave program. Copies of the Board policy are available in the Human Resources office.<br/>“Catastrophic illness” or “injury” is one that is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended<br/>period of time, or that incapacitates a member of the employee’s family which incapacity requires the<br/>employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time to care for that family member, and<br/>taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the employee. The employee requesting<br/>such leave must submit a doctor’s statement confirming the need for catastrophic leave and the<br/>employee must also submit to the Human Resources office a release authorizing the District to solicit<br/>unit members for donations of paid leave prior to any donations being received.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer School Sick Leave. Employees will be paid for summer school days missed<br/>because of: (1) jury duty; (2) direction by administration to attend to other school business; or (3) illness<br/>or injury if they have 44978 sick leave available. The deduction from sick leave will be equal to the<br/>number of hours missed, rounded up to a full hour. (Non-bargaining unit members will not be eligible<br/>for paid sick leave or pay while on jury duty.)</p>

<p>ARTICLE XI</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENTS. TRANSFERS AND FILLING OF VACANCIES</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “transfer” is the movement of a bargaining unit member from one school site<br/>or facility to another school site or facility.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “voluntary transfer” is a transfer initiated by a bargaining unit member between<br/>a school site or facility.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “involuntary transfer” is a transfer initiated by the District between a school</p>
<p>site or facility.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “assignment” is an initial assignment of a bargaining unit member into an<br/>instructional department/grade level at the same school site or facility.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “reassignment” is the movement of a unit member from: (a) one subject area to<br/>another subject area; or (b) one grade level to another grade level; or (c) from one track to another track<br/>at the same school site or facility.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary reassignment is one which is mutually agreed to by the unit<br/>member and District.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary reassignment is one which is imposed by the District<br/>without unit member approval.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of filling vacancies by transfer, a “vacancy” is any unit position<br/>which remains unfilled after assignments pursuant to Section 2 below.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Assignments. By March 15* the District management shall make<br/>preliminary assignments for the ensuing school year. Nothing in the preliminary assignment shall be<br/>construed as limiting the right of District management to make changes in such assignments or programs<br/>at any time consistent with the time limitation set forth below. With respect to modifications of</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>assignments during the school year, and unless the situation does not reasonably permit, the District<br/>shall notify the unit member of any changes in the assignment schedule at least two (2) weeks prior to<br/>the implementation of the change. However, no changes in assignment shall take effect before the first<br/>working day of the week following written notification to the unit member. Upon request, specific<br/>reasons for the change will be provided. Such changes will not be made for arbitrary, capricious, or<br/>punitive reasons.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting of Vacancies. Subsequent to the issuance of preliminary assignments according<br/>to Section 2 above, the District management shall post in each school and the District office a list of all<br/>known vacancies, if any, for the ensuing school year to provide an opportunity for voluntary transfer<br/>applications to be filed. Updated lists of known vacancies will be posted at least once each calendar<br/>month thereafter until the final workday of the regular school year. During the summer months the list<br/>shall be posted at least once during June, July and August, after which the posting will cease 30 days<br/>after the start of school. A file of all postings will be maintained at all school sites for each current<br/>school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for Transfer.</p>
<p>A. The District has established a phone message system which has all certificated<br/>bargaining unit vacancies on it phone # (951) 943-3099. All vacancies shall be placed on the machine at<br/>least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the closing date. Consideration will be given to all applications<br/>submitted prior to the closing date for any vacancies which are submitted to the Human Resources office<br/>after April 15<sup>th</sup>'</p>
<p>(1) Permanent bargaining unit members shall send a letter of request to be<br/>considered for transfer to another school site for the ensuing school year to the<br/>Human Resources office by March 15 of the prior school year. If an opening is<br/>anticipated and the unit member has met the timeline above and the criteria set</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>forth below then they will be considered for voluntary transfer. If the permanent<br/>unit member misses the timeline above they may apply and compete for any<br/>vacant position available after April 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for voluntary transfers shall be considered on the basis of (1)<br/>appropriate credentials; (2) District-wide seniority with appropriate subject matter experience; and (3)<br/>recentness of subject area preparation. If a voluntary request is denied, the District shall, upon request,<br/>provide specific written reasons for the denial to the unit member.</p>
<p>(1) The Superintendent may not transfer a teacher who request to be<br/>transferred to a school offering any of grades 7-12, inclusive, that is ranked in<br/>deciles 1 to 3, inclusive, on the Academic Performance Index if the principal of<br/>the school refuses to accept the transfer.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration will be given to all applications for any vacancies which are<br/>submitted to the Human Resources office within ten (10) unit workdays after placement of the notice of<br/>vacancy on a designated Association bulletin board (or up to 21 calendar days prior to the start of school,<br/>whichever is sooner), except that from 21 calendar days prior to the start of school to 30 calendar days<br/>after school has started, vacancies need only be posted until the position is filled. The final selection to<br/>fill the vacancy is within the sole discretion of the District management.</p>
<p>5. Preference for Unit Members. Any vacant position, which is defined for the purposes of<br/>this section as a bargaining unit position within a specific subject matter or areas either at a specific site<br/>or requiring the unit member to work at more than one site, shall be filled by giving preference to<br/>qualified unit members over non-unit member applicants. “Preference” as herein used shall mean that<br/>special weight shall be given such factor, but not that such applicant shall be guaranteed such<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Permanent employees shall have first consideration in the selection process for filling vacancies<br/>that occur or are identified on or before April 15 of each year. After April 15 of each year and up to the<br/>day before the duty year of the bargaining unit begins, all qualified applicants who have applied for the<br/>vacancy at the school shall have access to the selection process for filling the vacancy.</p>
<p>6. Involuntary Transfers.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure and Criteria. The District has the right to make involuntary transfers.<br/>Before making an involuntary transfer, the District shall first attempt to seek voluntary transfer<br/>applications in which case the procedures of Section 4 of this Article shall be followed. Even if a unit<br/>member or members volunteer for such vacancy, the District is not obligated to make such voluntary<br/>transfers. The District shall adhere to the following criteria in selecting the unit member to be<br/>transferred:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit members having the least seniority in the District will be<br/>considered first when making involuntary transfers.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member’s recentness of subject area preparation.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member’s credential must match the new assignment.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s selection of a unit member to be transferred shall be based<br/>on the best interests of the educational program. If this criteria is relied<br/>upon, the District shall be required to provide explicit, written reasons as<br/>to why the transfer would be in the best interests of the educational<br/>program.</p>
<p>“Appropriate voluntary transfer” as used above means a transfer which<br/>resolves the problem requiring the transfer in the first place.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification to Association of Involuntary Transfer. The District shall notify the<br/>Association in writing of any involuntary transfers, and upon request by the Association, shall consult</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>with the Association prior to making such involuntary transfer final.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification to Unit member of Involuntary Transfer. Prior to making an<br/>involuntary transfer final, the Human Resources office shall inform the unit member to be transferred, in<br/>writing, of the District’s intent to transfer the unit member stating specific reasons for the intended<br/>transfer. The unit member shall then have five (5) school days in which to accept the transfer or to<br/>request a meeting with the Superintendent or designee to discuss the intended transfer.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-punitive. Such transfers shall not be arbitrary or capricious and shall not be<br/>punitive or disciplinary in nature.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons for Involuntary Transfer. After a unit member is notified of an<br/>involuntary transfer, the unit member shall have the right to request, and the District shall provide in<br/>writing, within five (5) days of the request, the specific reasons why said unit member was selected for<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative Educational Programs. For the purposes of this paragraph “alternative<br/>educational programs” means the ILP program, home tutorial program or any other alternative programs<br/>developed after the execution of the Agreement, but not the continuation high school or the Community<br/>Day School.</p>
<p>(1) Regardless of any other provisions pertaining to assignments to the</p>
<p>alternative educational programs, it is agreed between the parties that such<br/>assignments shall be considered to be within the regular school programs<br/>with respect to the operation of the layoff provisions of the California<br/>Education Code. The purpose of this provision is to protect unit members<br/>assigned to such programs from thereby, upon future termination of such<br/>programs should that occur, becoming subject to lay off by reason of<br/>program termination.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>(2) Any unit member involuntarily assigned to an alternative education</p>
<p>program shall have the right to request a transfer at any time. Further,<br/>such unit member shall have the right, upon demand, to be transferred to a<br/>position within the regular school program after having completed at least<br/>two (2) years of duty in any alternative education program. Any unit<br/>member who utilizes this provision to be reassigned to the regular school<br/>program shall not be involuntarily reassigned to any alternative education<br/>program for at least two (2) years.</p>
<p>7. Filling of Vacancies at New Sites. For the purpose of filling vacancies at any new site,<br/>the following process shall be used:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for voluntary transfers to a new school site for vacancies in which the<br/>bargaining unit members holds the appropriate credential (excluding emergency credentials, but not<br/>Education Code Section 44258.7(c)(d) and (e) also known as “2/5 waivers”) and is highly qualified (as<br/>defined by NCLB) shall be considered on the basis of: (a) District-wide seniority; (b) District-wide<br/>seniority within subject area experience; (c) recentness of teaching the subject matter (excluding summer<br/>school and emergency credentials). This provision shall apply to filling the first sixty percent (60%) of<br/>the vacancies at the site. No more than forty percent (40%) of the bargaining unit members from any<br/>site shall be used to fill the seventy-five percent (75%) voluntary component. The remaining forty<br/>percent (40%) (rounded up to the nearest FTE) shall be filled at the District’s discretion to balance<br/>demographics, goals, etc. It is expressly understood that bargaining unit members who transfer into split<br/>assignments must maintain the appropriate credentials to avoid being transferred out of that position.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a voluntary request is denied, the District shall provide notice to the unit<br/>members. In addition, upon request, the District shall provide specific written reasons for the denial to</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>the unit member.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of Subsection (A), District-wide seniority is defined as the<br/>bargaining unit members’ first day of work.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever reasonably practical the District will maintain full assignments, as<br/>opposed to split assignments and split site assignments.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any voluntary transfer to a new site, under the sixty percent (60%) rule set forth<br/>above, that is disputed by a unit member shall be referred to a conflict resolution panel within five (5)<br/>days of the unit member receiving notice (of the decision on his request for transfer) for resolution.<br/>Resolution shall be achieved within five (5) days of the initial meeting of the conflict resolution panel.<br/>This conflict resolution panel shall consist of three (3) unit members selected by the Association and two</p>
<p>(2) administrators selected by the Superintendent or his designee, who shall give their decision (which<br/>shall be final) to the site administrator. The panel’s decision shall be final and not subject to the<br/>grievance procedure. It is clearly understood by both parties to the Collective Bargaining Agreement<br/>that a voluntary transfer decision to a new site will not be subject to the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>ARTICLE Xn</p>
<p>SUPERVISION OF NON-TEACHERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member develops concerns with respect to the performance of a paraeducator<br/>assigned to their work station, the unit member may:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notify the relevant administrator of the existence of the problem;</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet and discuss the problem with the administrator; and</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participate in determining on a course of action relating to resolution of the</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall work cooperatively with unit members on the assignments of student<br/>teachers from teacher training institutions. No student teacher shall be assigned to work with a unit<br/>member without the unit member’s approval. Unit members accepting student teachers shall be paid the<br/>student teacher fee offered by the educational institution. If a student teacher is supervised by more than<br/>one (1) master teacher, the fee will be prorated, based on periods assigned to the master teacher.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII</p>
<p>EVALUATION PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The evaluation process utilized by the Perris Union High School District is designed as a method<br/>for the continuous improvement and professional growth of the certificated staff.

<p>E. With respect to any materials to be placed in a unit member’s personnel file, the<br/>unit member shall be notified and receive a copy ten (10) working days in advance of such placement<br/>and shall have the right to attach a written response which shall become a permanent attachment to the</p>
<p>unit member’s file.</p>
<p>F. Grievances shall be limited to a claim that the procedures set forth in this Article<br/>have been violated, however, any portions of an evaluation may be contested in any proceeding against a<br/>unit member wherein such evaluation is used in any way.</p>
<p>3. Evaluation Process - Permanent Status.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall evaluate all permanent bargaining unit members at least once<br/>every two (2) years, except that whenever any permanent certificated unit member has received an<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation, such unit member shall be evaluated annually until the unit member achieves a<br/>positive evaluation or is separated from the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the end of the sixth (6th) school week the following steps will occur:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be notified of their primary evaluator and the need for<br/>evaluation within fifteen (15) days of the start of school.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator and the permanent unit member to be evaluated shall meet<br/>and mutually agree to the standards upon which the evaluation is to be<br/>based.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non classroom permanent Unit Members shall be evaluated on all<br/>Applicable Standards of Professional Performance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Observation conferences will be held according to the following</p>
<p>schedule:</p>
<p>(1) A pre-conference shall be held prior to each formal observation to agree<br/>upon:</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lesson plan;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the related data required on the pre-observation form;</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observations shall last the majority of an entire class period.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall receive prior notice of all formal observations. A unit<br/>member may request an additional evaluation by an administrator of the unit member’s choice at their<br/>same site, provided such administrator agrees to do the evaluation.</p>
<p>(1) A formal observation shall be followed by a post-observation conference<br/>within ten (10) working days at which time the evaluator and the unit<br/>member will discuss the evaluation of the observation and specific<br/>commendations as well as recommendations for improvement if any.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional formal observations are deemed necessary, the unit member shall be<br/>notified in advance. Upon request, the reasons for the additional observations will be put in writing to<br/>the unit member.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary evaluation will be provided to the unit member on the Certificated<br/>Evaluation Form no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summative evaluation may contain information related to direct<br/>informal observations and other factors in addition to the formal<br/>observation.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator will discuss the evaluation with the unit member prior to<br/>the end of the school year.</p>

<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the evaluation document will be given to the unit member.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this section, the end of the school year shall be the last<br/>school day scheduled on the school calendar.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the certificated evaluation result of any permanent unit member<br/>contains an “unsatisfactory” or “needs improvement” rating of the unit member’s performance, the<br/>District shall require an Improvement Plan for each “unsatisfactory” or “needs improvement” rating<br/>which must be in effect for a minimum of four (4) weeks before a notice of unsatisfactory performance<br/>can be given. Such evaluation may also include a requirement that the unit member shall participate in a<br/>program designed to improve appropriate areas of the unit member’s performance. In addition, specific<br/>written recommendations and/or assistance shall be given for improving performance when the<br/>evaluation contains an “unsatisfactory” or “needs improvement” rating for any reason. All Improvement<br/>Plans must be completed no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the end of the school year. Any post¬<br/>evaluation conferences will be held no later than five (5) days prior to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the Certificated Evaluation Form along with the unit member’s written<br/>response and any adverse data and other information upon which the unit member’s evaluation is based,<br/>shall be placed in the unit member’s personnel file as required by the Education Code.</p>
<p>4. Optional Five-Year Evaluation Cycle: Permanent Status Only.</p>
<p>A. In accordance with amended Education Code Section 44664, evaluation and<br/>assessment of certificated employees may be made at least every five years for permanent personnel who</p>
<p>have been employed at least ten (10) full years with the school district, are “highly qualified”, and whose<br/>previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting standards.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this agreement, “highly qualified” shall mean that: (i) the teacher<br/>has obtained full certification as a California teacher (including certification obtained through alternative<br/>routes to certification) or passed the California State Teachers Examination, and holds a credential to<br/>teach in California, (except that when used with respect to any teacher teaching in a public charter<br/>school, the term means that the teacher meets the requirements set forth in California’s public charter<br/>school law); and (ii) the teacher has not had certification or licensure requirements waived on an<br/>emergency, temporary, or provisional basis.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for the five-year program will be made on the Summative Evaluation</p>
<p>form.</p>
<p>(1) Unit members with permanent status who do not qualify for the five-year<br/>evaluation program or who are eligible but do not wish to participate shall<br/>be evaluated at least every other school year.</p>
<p>5. Evaluation Process - Probationarv/Emergencv/ and Intern Status.</p>
<p>A. All non-permanent status teachers will be evaluated according to the following</p>
<p>schedule:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All probationary (and other non-permanent status members hereinafter<br/>referred to as “probationary”) level one teachers will be evaluated on<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession Standard 2 and Standard</p>
<p>4. All probationary level two teachers will be evaluated on Standards 1, 3,<br/>and 5, and any “unsatisfactory” or “needs improvement” rating from<br/>Standard 2 or 4 in the previous year.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bargaining unit members holding Emergency or Intern credentials will</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>be evaluated in the same pattern as above (e g., odd years will be evaluated<br/>on Standards 2 and 4, even years on Standards 1, 3, and 5 etc ).</p>
<p>(3) New teachers hired after the start of school shall have this process<br/>prorated.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All non-permanent status teachers will be evaluated according to the following</p>
<p>process:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary Unit Members shall have at least two (2) formal<br/>observations and at least one (1) documented informal observation no later<br/>than the completion of the first semester or eighteen (18) weeks of service<br/>if their service began after the first week of school, or if they are at a site<br/>that is on a trimester schedule.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-conference shall be held prior to each formal observation to agree<br/>upon:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lesson plan;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the related data required on the pre-observation form;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the class period and date to be evaluated; and</p>

Moreover, recognizing the many challenges of teaching at the Community Day School, the<br/>parties shall explore incentives to encourage teachers to remain at the site. Therefore, the parties<br/>recognize that the following provisions shall control the wages and hours and other terms of employment<br/>for unit members assigned to Alternative Education sites in lieu of other Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement (“CBA”) provisions to the extent of any conflict. For example, class size requirements must<br/>conform to student needs and state requirements so that Article XIV and related agreements shall not<br/>apply.</p>

A copy of any notice of<br/>discipline shall be sent to the local office of the California Teachers Association and to the President of<br/>the Perris Secondary Educators Association (“Association”).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to any such discipline being imposed, the Superintendent or his/her designee will<br/>discuss his/her proposed action and the reasons for the action with the employee, and take into account<br/>any response of the employee.</p>

The party that requests this list of arbitrators shall pay for the costs incurred in obtaining this<br/>list. From this list of arbitrators, the parties shall strike alternately until only one (1) name remains, who<br/>shall be the arbitrator. The first strike shall be determined by the flip of a coin.

<p>Part II Extended Classroom Teaching Assignments</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is regularly scheduled to teach one (1) additional classroom<br/>period per day in excess of the normal assignment of unit members as set forth in Article<br/>IX, Section 4, shall receive one fifth (1/5) additional pay, based on such unit member’s<br/>annual salary. The District shall not offer such additional periods (“sixth period<br/>assignment”) in excess of the normal five (5) period teaching day, to a teacher who is in<br/>their first year of service with the District, unless the additional assignment has been<br/>posted and not filled. (The parties will also attempt to encourage the use of part-time and<br/>6th period teaching assignments where it is not detrimental to the education of the<br/>students in an effort to save benefit costs.) The pay for such assignment shall be<br/>calculated as follows: Employee’s annual salary divided by 184 days equals their per<br/>diem rate. The per diem rate shall then be multiplied by 20% and that product will be<br/>multiplied by the number of days the employee taught the sixth period assignment to<br/>determine their pay. For example an employee whose annual salary is $50,000 and<br/>taught the 6<sup>th</sup> period for 25 days would receive (($50,000 + 184) x .20) x 25 = $1,358.69.<br/>Unit members will be compensated monthly based on the number of days they taught a<br/>sixth (1/6) period assignment. Any employee that has been overpaid will have the<br/>overpayment deducted from their paychecks on a pro rata basis for the remainder of the<br/>year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Day School 7th/8th Periods: Teachers who choose to teach for seven or<br/>eight periods within the school day (outside the extended year portion of the DCDS<br/>school year) shall receive an hourly rate of pay for the 7th and 8th period of $31.20 an</p>
<p>hour, effective 2004.</p>

Pursuant to applicable law, retiring unit members may<br/>continue to purchase insurance coverage at District group rates.</p>

<p>Any permanent certificated unit member who has received an unsatisfactory evaluation, shall be evaluated annually until the unit member achieves a positive<br/>Certificated Evaluation Report or is separated from the district. In the event the Certificated Evaluation Form of any unit member contains an unsatisfactory rating of<br/>the unit member’s performance, the district shall require an Improvement Plan which must be in effect for a minimum of 4 weeks before a notice of unsatisfactory<br/>performance can be given. Such evaluation may also include a requirement that the unit member shall participate in a program designed to improve appropriate areas of<br/>the unit members’ performance. Specific written recommendations and/or assistance shall be given for improving performance when the evaluation contains an<br/>unsatisfactory rating for any reason. When the Evaluator indicates to an Evaluatee on the Certificated Evaluation Form that overall performance needs improvement or<br/>does not meet assessment criteria, specific suggestions must be in writing on this form to include all Areas of Improvement listed below.</p>
