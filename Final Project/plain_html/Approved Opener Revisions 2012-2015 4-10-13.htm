<p>7.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning to work from Sick Leave following surgery<br/>or hospitalization, upon the request of the District, must provide a written medical<br/>doctor’s release certifying the reasons for such absence and medical permission to<br/>return to work and any work related restrictions.</p>
<p>7.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a medical doctor’s certification of illness or<br/>injury as the condition for the payment of Sick Leave when a unit member is absent<br/>more than five (5) consecutive work days or if there is a pattern of absence in<br/>conjunction with the weekend or holiday. Such certification shall be provided promptly<br/>by the unit member.</p>
<p>7.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member's employment terminates and more Sick<br/>Leave has been used than earned, the amount used, but not earned, shall be deducted<br/>from the final pay warrant.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>7.3 Extended Illness</p>
<p>Unit members are entitled to receive differential compensation, under<br/>Education Code section 44977, for a period of up to five (5) school months.

<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave</p>
<p>A unit member may utilize accumulated Sick Leave for the purpose of a<br/>disability related to pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and the recovery there from. The<br/>length of such leave, including the date on which the leave shall commence and the<br/>date on which the unit member shall resume duties, shall be determined by the unit<br/>member's physician; provided that such verification demonstrates that such leave is for<br/>pregnancy related disability.

<p>7.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be eligible to apply for a leave of absence<br/>because of industrial accident or illness arising out of a claim which the District’s<br/>insurance carrier determines to be valid and which is recognized as compensable after<br/>adjudication under the workers’ compensation statues. Upon submission of a claim, the<br/>unit member shall, as soon as possible, perform all appropriate actions necessary to file<br/>for Workers’ Compensation, disability, income protection benefits, or the like.</p>
<p>7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leaves shall be for not more than one period of sixty (60)<br/>work days in any one fiscal year for the same accident and shall commence with the first<br/>day of absence.</p>
<p>7.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence under this provision shall not be accumulated<br/>from year to year. When the industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next<br/>fiscal year, the unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due<br/>him/her for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>7.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be paid such portion of the salary due them for<br/>any month in which absence occurs as, when added to the temporary disability<br/>indemnity under the California Labor Code, will result in payment to them of not more</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>than their full salaries.</p>
<p>7.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence applied for under this provision shall be reduced<br/>by one day for each day of authorized absence, regardless of a temporary disability<br/>indemnity award to the unit member.</p>
<p>7.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial illness and accident leave is to be used in lieu of Sick<br/>Leave. If a unit member is receiving a temporary disability indemnity, the unit member<br/>shall be entitled to utilize only so much of his/her sick leave which, when added to<br/>his/her temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her of no more<br/>than a full day's wages or salary. The District, in turn, shall issue the appropriate salary<br/>warrants for payment of salary and shall deduct normal retirement and other authorized<br/>deductions.</p>
<p>7.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless travel outside of California is authorized by the District in<br/>writing prior to the commencement of said travel, unit members receiving benefits under<br/>this Article during a period of illness or injury shall remain in the State of California. This<br/>provision shall not apply in cases of necessary medical care of the employee.</p>
<p>7.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require, from time to time, a written statement from<br/>the unit member’s physician verifying a unit member’s absence under this leave and<br/>his/her ability to return to work, or verifying the continued illness or inability to work due<br/>to an illness or accident.</p>
<p>7.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall provide a written statement from the unit<br/>member's physician verifying the cause of the unit member's absence under this leave<br/>and specifying a date for reevaluation or for return to work. The unit member shall<br/>provide a written statement from the physician after the reevaluation specifying the date<br/>for return to work. If the date to return to work is to be extended or shortened, the unit<br/>member's physician shall provide a written statement specifying the reasons for the<br/>extension or shortening of the date for return to work. The District may require a written<br/>statement from the unit member's physician certifying medical permission to return to<br/>service at the end of this leave, specifying any work related restrictions.</p>
<p>7.5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence under this provision shall be reduced by one (1)<br/>day for each day of authorized absence, regardless of a temporary disability indemnity<br/>award or other compensation from any other source paid to the unit member.</p>

The need for flexibility during the opening days of<br/>school is recognized. Therefore, the Principal will be allowed a three week period of<br/>grace to balance class loads. The Principal will make every effort to consult the<br/>instructor when the desirable limit is reached, during or after pre-registration. Any<br/>students enrolled after the desirable limit is reached will be informed that their<br/>enrollment is contingent upon the Principal being able to adjust the class enrollment to<br/>the desired number.</p>
<p>Classes participating in the Class Size Reduction Program shall have the<br/>maximum class size allowed by the legislation.</p>
<p>The average class size for self-contained classes, exclusive of those classes<br/>participating in the Class Size Reduction Program shall be 1:30.</p>
<p>The class size average shall be determined by dividing the student enrollment by<br/>the number of regular class room teachers.</p>

<p>APPENDIX I</p>
<p>Tentative Agreement between the Trinity Alps Unified School District<br/>And the Trinity Alps Unified Teachers Association/CTA/NEA<br/>July 1,2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers work year will be 183 days, less three (3) furlough days for a total of 180 days. The<br/>three furlough days will be August 17, 2012, February 25, 2013 and June 3, 2013. The 180 days<br/>will be made up of one (1) pre-service day and 179 instructional days for students. The District<br/>will rescind three (3) layoff notices for regular classroom teachers paid out of the general fund and<br/>will shift Title I funds to pay an Intervention Specialist at the elementary school. Class sizes will<br/>remain as in the current contract. However, the contract language in Article VI 6.1 calling for<br/>teachers to have the equivalent of one (1) day to work in their classroom would be void for the<br/>2012-13 school year. The one (1) pre-service day will be used for staff meetings at the worksite.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Governor’s tax proposal fail to qualify for the November 2012 ballot and/or fail to<br/>pass, the District and the Association will implement an additional three (3) furlough days to be<br/>taken on February 20, 21 and 22, 2013. Loss of compensation for any and all furlough days will be<br/>based on the employee’s daily rate of pay. In case one of the “other” tax initiatives qualifies for the<br/>November ballot and passes, the District and Association will meet to determine what, if any,<br/>adjustments need to be made with respect to the additional three (3) furlough days (February 20, 21<br/>and 22, 2013).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Forest Reserve funds are extended for one year as part of the Senate Transportation Bill the<br/>District and Association will meet to discuss how and what extra curricular and co-curricular<br/>services shown on the current Appendix D will be funded for 2012-13 (extra curricular and co-<br/>curricular to be defined in the contract).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mileage will be paid to employees serving at two (2) sites. The site that the employee starts work<br/>at will be their base and they will be paid mileage from that site to the other site.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree benefits listed in Appendix F for Weaverville Elementary School teachers will be the<br/>same as those listed for Trinity Union High School teachers and will be effective on the date this<br/>agreement is signed. Appendix F will be retitled as “Trinity Alps Unified School District Retiree<br/>Insurance Benefits”.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article III, Term: 3.1 change to “This Agreement shall be effective July 1, 2012 and shall continue<br/>in full force and effect through June 30, 2015”; 3.2 change to “This completes negotiations on all<br/>topics within the scope of negotiations for the 2012-13 school year. All topics not included herein<br/>are deemed withdrawn. Neither party is required to negotiate further on any topic within the scope<br/>of negotiation for the 2012-13 year except by mutual written agreement”; 3.3 change to “Either<br/>party may reopen negotiations on Article VIII: Compensation (including Wages, Salary Schedule<br/>Provisions, Extra Duty, Insurance, Travel Expense Reimbursements and Retiree Insurance) and<br/>any two (2) subjects or articles within the scope of negotiation by giving written notice to the other<br/>party no later than March 15<sup>,h</sup> of each year (2013 &amp; 2014)”; 3.4 change to “No later than March<br/>15<sup>th</sup> of 2015, the Association and District shall submit their initial proposals to each other for a<br/>successor Agreement. The District shall give proper public notice of such proposals at the first<br/>regular Board meeting following submission of the proposals”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Tentative Agreement between the Trinity Alps Unified School District<br/>And the Trinity Alps Teachers Association/CTA/NEA</p>
<p>This Agreement will become effective July 1, 2013 once it has been ratified by both<br/>parties, hereto:</p>
<p>Article VIII Compensation</p>
<p>8.1 Wages will read:</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1,2013 unit members covered by this Agreement<br/>shall be paid the salaries shown on the salary schedule, Appendix<br/>B. (Note: This is a 3% increase of the 2012-13 salary schedule.<br/>The 3% increase will also be applied to the amended Extra Service<br/>Salary Schedule).</p>
<p>8.8 Insurance will read:</p>
<p>8.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum monthly insurance premium contribution for unit<br/>members is $919.25. The maximum contribution per school year<br/>is $ 11,031.00 for medical benefits including health, prescription,<br/>dental and vision insurance coverage. (Note: The rest of 8.8.1<br/>remains as is).</p>
<p>The attached 11 pages show all proposed changes that are made as part of the Tentative<br/>Agreement.</p>
