<p>4.2.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the power and jurisdiction of the arbitrator</p>
<p>shall be limited to deciding whether there has been a violation,<br/>misapplication, or misinterpretation of the terms and conditions of<br/>this Agreement.</p>

However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to<br/>include in any award such financial reimbursement or other<br/>remedies as he/she judges to be consistent with the terms of this<br/>Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the<br/>Superintendent and the Association and will be final and binding<br/>upon the parties of this Agreement.</p>

If the parties are unable to reach agreement, the District or Association may<br/>submit matters concerning the interpretation of the terms and conditions of the agreement<br/>to arbitration, which shall be conducted in accordance with Level Four.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 9<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>9.1 Except in traditional large group instruction or experimental classes where the<br/>Association has agreed in writing, the class size maximum shall be:</p>
<p>Elementary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum</p>
<p>Kindergarten - Third &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22**</p>
<p>Fourth - Fifth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28</p>
<p>Sixth - Eighth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28*</p>
<p>Combination Class 4/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26</p>
<p>* Determined by the total pupil contact per day (e.g. 5 periods x 28 students per day =<br/>140) excluding specialty classes listed under 9.3 and activity classes.</p>
<p>** Maximum class size in K-3 is dependent on continued State funding to support 22 per<br/>class. Should State funding become insufficient to support the above maximum class size<br/>for K-3 grade levels, the maximums will revert to 28.</p>
<p>At Orchard View School the case load shall be a maximum of 22 students and one<br/>enrichment class.</p>
<p>Teachers teaching a K-12 enrichment class:</p>
<p>22 students + 1 class = 100%</p>
<p>18 students + 1 class = 80%</p>
<p>13 students + 1 class = 60%</p>
<p>11 students + 1 class = 50%</p>
<p>Teachers teaching more than one class:</p>
<p>K-12 enrichment class = 2.75 students</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall pay 10% of the present year funded revenue limit (FRL) per pupil over<br/>the maximum class size stated above. Payment shall be made at the conclusion of the<br/>school year and shall be based upon actual enrollment on a prorata basis for that period of<br/>time during the school year that the student maximums are exceeded. Orchard View<br/>School teachers will not be required to carry more than 22 students at any time (pro-rated<br/>for part-time teachers).</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this Article, traditional large group instruction includes the following:</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study Hall</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;related&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;games</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Band</p>

<p>9.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arts and Crafts</p>
<p>9.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other large group instructional classes that have the mutual agreement<br/>between teacher and principal</p>
<p>The goal of the District is to have small group instruction in special day classes. When<br/>Special Education capacity exceeds the current District policy (current Resolution 2011-<br/>428 - Appendix O), the teacher and principal will meet to discuss methods to address the<br/>needs of the class and the teacher.</p>

<p>TWIN HILLS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE BELIEVE IN THE FUNDAMENTAL INTEGRITY, DIGNITY, AND WORTH OF<br/>THE INDIVIDUAL.</p>
<p>In order to survive, society must preserve the worth and integrity of the individual; to<br/>progress, it must capitalize upon his initiative, capabilities, and efforts.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPAL OF EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY<br/>FOR ALL.</p>
<p>The principal of equal educational opportunity for all implies a responsibility for the<br/>school to meet the individual needs 0± all its students.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE BELIEVE IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SCHOOL TO HELP PREPARE<br/>THE INDIVIDUAL FOR EFFECTIVE CITIZENSHIP.</p>
<p>True human liberty can exist only in a democratic society, and a healthy democratic<br/>society needs informed, responsible citizens. It is, therefore, a responsibility of the school<br/>to develop an understanding and appreciation of, and a loyalty to, our democratic way of<br/>life and. the representative government that makes it possible.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WE BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION IS A MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY SHARED BY<br/>THE HOME, THE SCHOOL, THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT, AND OTHER<br/>AGENCIES OF SOCIETY.</p>
<p>The ultimate educational goal, a full realization of the student’s intellectual, physical,<br/>moral, and spiritual potential, can be achieved only through the cooperative effort of all<br/>concerned.</p>

<p>Contract as of June 2012</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF BELIEFS</p>
<p>The governing board of the Twin Hills Union School District recognizes its responsibility<br/>to clarify its beliefs on matters affecting the Twin Hills Union School District so that positive and<br/>wise decisions can be taken on matters that are the board’s responsibility. For this reason, a<br/>statement of beliefs to which this board is committed follows:</p>
<p>OUR CHILDREN</p>
<p>We believe that every child should have the richest opportunity possible to develop to the<br/>fullest his potential for a creative and useful life. That it is the purpose of Twin Hills Union<br/>School District and public education to help children realize this potential, for it is recognized<br/>that every child has a potentially important contribution to make to society, and that a quality<br/>education will help make his development and contribution possible.</p>
<p>OUR SCHOOL</p>
<p>We believe that the school has been assigned the major responsibility for teaching basic<br/>knowledge, skills, and understanding. However, our school must view the student as a total<br/>person and be concerned with his total development. The development of his mind must not take<br/>place separate from feelings, values, and purposes.</p>
<p>OUR CURRICULUM</p>
<p>We believe that if we are to truly serve the needs of our children and the purposes for<br/>which public education was founded, we must have balance in our school curriculum. There<br/>should also be diversity of experiences and methods to insure that the wide range of learning<br/>needs that exist within any group of children are met. The responsibility for providing the<br/>necessary facilities and materials to enhance the optimum learning experience shall be that of the<br/>Twin Hills Union School District.</p>
<p>OUR TEACHING EXPECTATIONS</p>
<p>We believe that children learn as a result of their interaction with their environment, and<br/>that planning and organization of the school environment are necessary to allow the optimum in<br/>learning experiences to take place. The teaching rooms should be so organized as to encourage<br/>children to be actively engaged in the investigation and discovery of the relationships that exists<br/>within their environment. A wide variety of materials should be used in the classroom to help<br/>the child assess the relationships to which he is being exposed.</p>
<p>It should be the expectation of every member of the certificated staff to help children<br/>develop the habits, tools, and skills necessary for independent learning. It is believed that<br/>teaching experiences should help children become independent of the teacher, and strengthen<br/>their ability to learn under their own power. In this way, the children will gain the motivation for<br/>continuous education throughout life.</p>
<p>Appendix F - Page 3 of 13</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Contract as of June 2012</p>
<p>OUR METHODS AND USES OF EVALUATION</p>
<p>We believe that the purpose of evaluation is the discovery of information that will make<br/>the certificated staff more aware of the individual needs of the children that are their<br/>responsibility. This information should be the basis for changes in curriculum to meet the unmet<br/>needs. Frequent parent/teacher conferences should be held to keep parents well informed as to<br/>the progress of their children, and to solicit information that will be helpful to the teacher in<br/>coming to know the child better. Further, we believe that standards of expected student progress<br/>must be developed, with professional consideration given to home and school environment, and<br/>that all certificated personnel should be evaluated in terms of those standards.</p>
<p>OUR SCHOOL ORGANIZATION</p>
<p>We believe the most effective unit of organization for the K-4 elementary students is the<br/>self-contained classroom. The students spend the major portion of their day with one teacher.<br/>Services of specialists should be available, but the immediate responsibility for the child’s school<br/>program should rest with the regular classroom teacher.</p>
<p>The program at the seventh and. eighth grade levels should prepare the students for their<br/>high school experience. This gives students the opportunity to meet with several teachers for a<br/>shorter period of time, and provides students with an elective period for the purpose, of<br/>enrichment, enjoyment, and learning to make decisions. Through the use of the trimester<br/>program, the unique talents of the teaching staff can be utilized. The trimester program also<br/>provides fundamental or basic class offerings, as well as advanced classes.</p>

<p>GOALS STATEMENT</p>
<p>It is the goal of the Twin Hills Union School District to provide the necessary teachers,<br/>classified personnel, facilities, and supportive staff to create the optimum learning environment<br/>so as to insure that every student has an opportunity to realize his/her maximum potential as a<br/>person. Through his/her experiences as a student he/she will develop those qualities of<br/>intelligence and citizenship that enhance our society.</p>

<p>A suitable learning environment is defined as an environment free from unnecessary<br/>discomfort, distraction, and disorder. The teacher should make every attempt to insure<br/>that the room is comfortable and well organized. Work areas should be cleared when the<br/>work is completed and unused materials should be stored.

<p>TWIN HILLS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>ARTICLES 21 &amp; 35 CERTIFICATED RETIREMENT PROGRAMS<br/>AGREEMENT FOR ONE YEAR ONLY: 2010-11</p>
<p>To encourage additional retirements to be effective at the close of the current 2010-11 school<br/>year, the District and Association will agree to two one-time only changes to Articles 21 and 35<br/>which are as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the upper age (age 60) limitation so that the qualifying employee can qualify at<br/>ages 61-63 (as of June 30, 2011) and will receive the benefit at the 35% benefit level<br/>pursuant to Articles 21.3.1.1 and 35.3.1.1.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a certificated employee does not meet the minimum 15 year eligibility requirement,<br/>he/she will receive a pro-ration of the benefit based on her/her number of years as a<br/>percentage of 15. Thus, a 12 year employee would receive 12/15 or 80% of the benefit as<br/>reflected in Articles 21.3.1.1 and 35.3.1.1.</p>
<p>These changes would only be effective for retirements at the end of 2010-11 school year with a<br/>certificated employee notifying the District by May 1, 2011 of his/her intent to retire and<br/>participate in the Certificated Retirement Programs.</p>
<p>No new retirement incentive proposal will be offered by the District earlier than the 2013-14<br/>school year.</p>
