<p>Public Disclosure of Collective Bargaining<br/>Sacramento City Unified School District</p>
<p>SCTA, 2007-2008 Contract</p>
<p>6/13/2008</p>
<p>Tentative Agreement<br/>Between</p>
<p>SCUSD and SCTA</p>
<p>2007-08 and 2008-09</p>
<p>The Sacramento City Unified School District (SCUSD) and the Sacramento City Teachers<br/>Association (SCTA), known as the parties, have considered mutual interest and recognize the<br/>value of a long-term agreement for the benefit of employees, students, and the community.</p>
<p>The parties also recognize both economic realities and reasonable expectations, as well as the<br/>common desire to improve academic achievement/reward employees.</p>
<p>The parties therefore agree to the following:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2007-08, the parties agree to the following considerations:</p>
<p>1. For 2007-08, the salary schedules and related stipends will increase by 2.22%,</p>
<p>.72% effective July 1, 2007 and 1.50% effective June 1, 2008. (The .72%<br/>additional Health &amp; Welfare savings, extra duty stipends, unfilled positions and<br/>substitute savings are specific savings due only to the SCTA bargaining unit.)</p>
<p>The 1.50% shall be applied in a proportionate and equal manner to SCTA unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>1 a. The increase that would apply to extra duty stipends and single health refund</p>
<p>will be held in abeyance to allow the parties to consider changes to the extra duty<br/>schedule issues related to gender, and uniformity,<br/>lb. Retro checks will be issued as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2008-09, the parties agree to the following considerations:</p>
<p>1. For the 2008-09 school year bargaining for compensation will be reopened if the<br/>final state budget results in more or less funds for the district’s General Fund than<br/>budgeted in the 2008-09 adopted budget.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to extend the termination date of the Agreement through<br/>June 30,2011.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to continue completing contract obligations from the 2006-07<br/>negotiated agreement. The items include final language regarding active and Medicare<br/>risk programs, dental program, and life insurance.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to consider District-wide school reform interventions regarding<br/>Common Planning Time (CPT) and mutual agreeable support for continued high school<br/>initiatives. <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Level I Local Problem Solving</p>
<p>Preamble: The purpose of Level I shall be to solve the specific allegation^), issue(s) or problem(s) as framed by<br/>the grievant at the site or lowest possible level. The grievant and principal or unit administrator should attempt to<br/>resolve the grievance either informally or formally at Level I. The parties are encouraged to work out a solution<br/>that is consistent with the Contract. Solutions reached at Level I are considered non-precedential.</p>
<p>Informal Track: A grievance may be discussed orally with grievant's principal or unit administrator with the<br/>objective of resolving the matter informally, without the filing of the grievance form. However, nothing shall<br/>preclude the filing of a written grievance prior to or during the informal meeting. The informal process may<br/>include the SCTA as grievance representative.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of the meeting is to focus on solution. The parties shall attempt to define the issue, discuss<br/>interests, explore options, and, if possible, agree to an outcome. Upon request, the solution, if any, will<br/>be reduced in writing.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If through formal or informal means, resolution is reached in writing or other mutually acceptable<br/>manner, all grievance documents may be destroyed;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solutions that require implementation beyond the school site or unit level shall first be reviewed for<br/>implementation by the appropriate District-level administrator. Solutions that do not require review and<br/>are accepted will be implemented by the principal or unit administrator.</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with attempted resolution by informal means, and the grievant wishes to<br/>file a formal grievance, the grievant must submit the grievance in writing to the principal or unit administrator<br/>upon forms provided by the District.</p>
<p>Formal Track: If a formal grievance has been filed, the grievant may:</p>
<p>a. discuss the grievance personally, or</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>b. request that a designated grievance representative accompany the grievant to the meeting to discuss the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>The meeting should be held within ten (10) working days after filing the grievance.</p>
<p>4.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) working days following the meeting to discuss the grievance, the principal or unit administrator<br/>shall render the decision and the reasons therefore, in writing, to the grievant and to the exclusive representative.<br/>Information copies of the decision at this level shall be sent to the superintendent's designee for Employee<br/>Relations and the appropriate District administrator having responsibility for the organizational segment with<br/>which the grievance was processed.</p>
<p>4.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written grievance should include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the specific grounds of the grievance;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the specific article or section of the Agreement alleged to have been violated;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of specific actions requested of the principal or unit administrator which will remedy the</p>
<p>grievance.</p>
<p>4.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Level I Meeting:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of the meeting is to focus on a solution to the specific allegations), issue(s) or problem(s).<br/>The parties shall attempt to define the issue, discuss interests, explore options, and, if possible, agree to<br/>an outcome;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If through formal or informal means, resolution is reached in writing or other mutually acceptable<br/>manner, all grievance documents may be destroyed;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solutions that require implementation beyond the school site or unit level shall first be reviewed for<br/>implementation by the appropriate District-level administrator. Solutions that do not require review and<br/>are accepted will be implemented by the principal or unit administrator.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II</p>
<p>4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level I, the Association may file a<br/>request for a Level II meeting within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the Level I decision. Grievants not<br/>complying with the above time constraints for filing at Level II will be deemed to have waived their rights to a<br/>Level II meeting. The party filing for a Level II meeting will forward the written grievance and the Level I<br/>decision to the Office of Employee Relations. The written grievance should include:</p>
<p>4.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the specific grounds of the grievance, including names, dates, and places necessary for an<br/>understanding of the grievance;</p>
<p>4.4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the specific article or section of the Agreement alleged to have been violated.</p>
<p>4.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of specific actions requested of the school District which will remedy the grievance.</p>
<p>4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Level II form for appeal shall be considered a formal request for a meeting and a written decision by the</p>
<p>superintendent or his/her designee. The meeting should be held within twenty (20) working days from receipt of<br/>the grievance by the Office of Employee Relations.</p>
<p>4.4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and SCTA agree to make every effort to schedule Level II grievance meetings twice a month. The<br/>intent of the parties is to hear all grievances within 40 working days of time of appeal as postmarked.</p>
<p>4.4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be two tracks to solve the problem. The union shall reserve the right to choose either:<br/>a. the Mediation Track as described in Sections 4.4.3 through 4.4.3.8 or,</p>
<p>b. the Interest Based Track as described in Sections 4.4.4 through 4.4.4 3.</p>
<p>4.4.2 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under either Track, the parties understand that mutual agreements secured at Level II are precedent setting unless</p>
<p>the parties stipulate otherwise.</p>
<p>4.42.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time will be provided for the teacher(s) participating at Level II meetings upon the written request of the</p>
<p>Association.</p>
<p>4.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediation</p>
<p>Grievances appealed to Level II may be submitted to mediation. Mediation shall take place on the first and third<br/>Tuesday of each calendar month. Subsequent days for mediation will be scheduled, if necessary. The parties<br/>agree to mutually develop a Level II grievance calendar for each year at the same time mediators are selected, as<br/>per 4.4.3.3.</p>
<p>4.4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no case shall the adjustment or resolution of grievances at this level exceed forty (40) working days from<br/>the date of their appeal at Level II, unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. If not extended, the<br/>Association may appeal the grievance to Level III.</p>
<p>4.4.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediators who have been selected by the parties to mediate grievance disputes at Level II, will be scheduled on a<br/>rotating and available basis.</p>
<p>4.4.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to meet annually in May to review the mediators listed above. The list of mediators for the<br/>subsequent year shall be mutually agreed upon, but should the parties be unable to agree on a new list, the<br/>previous list will continue until such time as a new list is agreed to.</p>
<p>4.4.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs of the mediator, if any, shall be borne equally by the parties. No party shall purposely withhold<br/>information at this level but shall disclose all information relevant to the grievance for consideration by the other<br/>party.</p>
<p>4.4.3 5 Mediation Procedures</p>
<p>The mediation procedure shall be entirely informal in nature, however, copies of exhibits upon which either party<br/>bases its case shall be shared with the other party. The relevant facts should be elicited in a narrative fashion o<br/>the extent possible, rather than through examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The rales of evidence<br/>will not apply and no record of the proceedings will be made. All persons involved in the events giving rise to the<br/>grievance should be encouraged to participate fully in the proceedings, both by stating their views and by asking<br/>questions of the other participants at the mediation hearing.</p>
<p>4.4.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary effort of the mediator shall be to assist the parties in settling the stated grievance in a mutually<br/>satisfactory fashion. In attempting to achieve a settlement, the mediator is free to use all of the techniques<br/>customarily associated with the mediation process, including private conferences with only one party. If<br/>settlement is not possible, the mediator shall provide the parties with an immediate bench opinion, based on the<br/>stated grievance and the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as to how the grievance would be decided if it went to<br/>Arbitration. That opinion would not be final or binding, but would be advisory. It would be delivered orally and<br/>would be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the mediator's opinion. The advisory opinion may be<br/>used as the basis for further settlement discussions or for withdrawal or granting of the grievance. If the<br/>grievance is not settled, granted or withdrawn, the parties are free to arbitrate. If they do, the mediator shall not<br/>serve as arbitrator, and no offers or concessions made by the parties or the mediator during mediation can be used<br/>against a party during arbitration.</p>
<p>Neither attorneys nor court reporters or any other type of note-taker shall be allowed to be present at the<br/>proceedings.</p>
<p>4.4.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parties agree to be bound by a mediator's recommendation, the subsequent Agreement shall be reduced to<br/>writing and signed by the parties.</p>
<p>4.4.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievance not resolved within twenty (20) working days of the initial mediation session with no subsequent<br/>mediation session(s) scheduled and which the Association wishes to pursue may be appealed by the Association<br/>to Level HI. Any grievance not resolved at the initial mediation session or additional mediation session(s) and</p>

<p>4.5.1.2</p>
<p>4.5.2</p>
<p>4.5.3</p>
<p>which the Association wishes to pursue may be appealed by the Association to Level III within forty (40)<br/>working days of its submission by the grievant or the Association at Level II. Any such appeal shall be made<br/>within ten (10) working days of the appropriate above-mentioned deadline.</p>
<p>Interest Based Track</p>
<p>The interest based approach is intended to utilize any or all of the six step interest based problem solving model<br/>and appropriate individuals needed to reach a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
<p>The six step model shall include the following:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting an Issue</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Describing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Situation</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options and BATNAS (alternatives)</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria for the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding on the Outcome</p>
<p>Any grievance not resolved shall be treated per the timeline provisions of 4.4.3.8 of this Article.</p>
<p>Level III</p>
<p>If the Association is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, the Association may request a hearing before an<br/>arbitrator within twenty (20) working days of the receipt of the Level II decision. Such requests by the<br/>Association's executive director, or official designee, will be in writing and shall be filed with the superintendent's<br/>designee for Employee Relations. The Association will within ten (10) working days of the filing of the request<br/>for arbitration with the District, notify the American Arbitration Association and request a list of arbitrators. If<br/>such request is not filed within the time limitations prescribed above, the grievant will be deemed to have<br/>waived the right to a Level III meeting.</p>
<p>Within thirty (30) calendar days of the appeal to Level III, and in no case later than thirty (30) days prior to the<br/>Level III meeting before the arbitrator, the parties agree to meet in a conference to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempt to frame the issue to be submitted to the arbitrator</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share all evidence</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarify whether a court reporter is necessary, determine the site</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-initiate efforts to settle, if possible.</p>
<p>The parties agree that any evidence discovered subsequent to conference will be shared at least seven (7) days<br/>prior to arbitration. Evidence shared less than seven (7) days for presentation of new evidence will be grounds for<br/>delay at the request of the receiving party. The party presenting new evidence (initially) shall be charged for the<br/>cost of the arbitrator.</p>
<p>A certified court reporter shall be employed to record verbatim the entire arbitration hearing if requested by either<br/>the grievant or the District. In any case in which a court reporter is involved, the parties shall share equally the<br/>cost of such reporter, including per diem, mileage, and other out-of-pocket expenses. If the arbitrator requests a<br/>court reporter, the parties shall likewise share equally the cost of such reporter. The cost of transcripts shall be<br/>borne by the party ordering such transcripts.</p>
<p>When arbitration has been requested, the parties may mutually agree on an arbitrator or shall contact the<br/>American Arbitration Association for a list of arbitrators in accordance with American Arbitration Association<br/>procedures. The grievant or designee and the superintendent's designee for Employee Relations shall alternately<br/>strike names from such list until only one (1) name remains. This person shall be designated as the arbitrator and<br/>shall proceed to hear the grievance under the voluntary rules of the American Arbitration Association insofar as<br/>said rules do not conflict with the grievance procedure in this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.5.4</p>
<p>4.5.5</p>
<p>4.5.5.1</p>
<p>4.5.5.2</p>
<p>4.5.6</p>
<p>4.5.7</p>
<p>4.5.8</p>
<p>4.5.9</p>
<p>4.5.10</p>
<p>4.6</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem expenses, his/her travel and<br/>subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing room will be borne equally by the Board and the Association.<br/>All other costs will be borne by the parly incurring them.</p>
<p>The function of the arbitrator shall be:</p>
<p>To hold a hearing concerning the grievance, and</p>
<p>To render an award in accordance with the timelines agreed to between the parties and the arbitrator after the<br/>close of the hearing. The arbitrator's decision will be binding on all parties.</p>
<p>Once the arbitrator has been selected, hearings shall commence and be held at the convenience of the arbitrator.<br/>However, hearings shall be confined to working days.</p>
<p>Neither the District nor the grievant shall be permitted to assert any grounds or evidence before the arbitrator<br/>which was not previously disclosed to the other party. The arbitrator shall consider only those issues which have<br/>been properly carried through prior steps as required by the provisions of this grievance procedure.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall not render any award which conflicts with or alters this Agreement. It is understood,<br/>however, that the arbitrator shall interpret the Agreement in accordance with acceptable rules of contract<br/>construction.</p>
<p>The arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such financial reimbursements or other remedies as judged to<br/>be proper.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear the full costs for its representation in the arbitration. The administrative costs of the<br/>American Arbitration Association and the arbitrator's fees and charges shall be divided equally between the<br/>grievant and the District.</p>
<p>The parties agree that it is beneficial to resolve pending grievances as expeditiously and fairly as possible. To<br/>that end, the parties are interested in bringing pending grievances, particularly those at the arbitration stage to a<br/>conclusion in a reasonable time. The parties therefore agree to meet and seriously consider methods to expedite<br/>pending grievance resolution including, but not limited to, considering grouping grievances on similar issues,<br/>mediation/arbitration procedures, appointment of special masters or permanent panels and other alternatives<br/>which the parties may agree upou</p>

This goal applies to each week which includes a regular teaching day. The sites<br/>may provide one or more of the following options within legal parameters and program needs. Annually, the site<br/>shall decide which option(s) will be used.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early/late options</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubling of class size reduction (CSR) and non-CSR classes during the early or late<br/>reading periods. This can be done depending on safety, facilities, and program. Reading and<br/>library skills teachers will provide the service to the doubled class. The doubling up means<br/>that each two teachers will count as one.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubhng up of CSR classes during the middle part of the day. This can be done depending on<br/>safety, facilities, and program. Reading and library skills teachers may provide the service to<br/>the doubled class.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By student exchange where a teacher teaches another class of students in the early period,<br/>providing prep for their teacher. The teacher providing prep in the morning will receive prep<br/>in the late period by a similar exchange.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By early day prep. Where possible, all students would be on an early schedule. The time<br/>difference would be considered prep time.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Computer Lab teachers or resource teachers, where available. Such teachers may provide<br/>the program for students and prep for their teachers.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sutterville Non-Early/late Options</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubling up of CSR classes during the day. This can be done depending on safety, facilities,<br/>and program. Reading and library skills teachers may provide the service to the doubled class.<br/>Two teachers will count as one.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Computer Lab teachers or Computer Lab Resource teachers, where available. Such<br/>teachers may provide the program for students and prep time for their teachers.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all Elementary schools</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexible prep time for prep specialist teachers. Ordinarily, prep time is expected to be provided<br/>in approximate 45 minute segments. However, in order to facilitate scheduling, prep specialist<br/>prep time may be allocated in shorter segments when documentably necessary. In return, time<br/>on shortened days after the student day shall be considered prep time for prep specialists.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prep specialist teaching prep day is understood to be the same as all other grade 1-6<br/>teachers at the site.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>(3) In those schools where additional minutes are available within a preparation specialist's<br/>instructional day, those minutes are to be used to provide additional minutes of preparation<br/>time on a regular or intermittent basis to qualifying teachers. The available minutes are to be<br/>distributed as equitably as possible among the qualifying teachers. It needs to be reiterated that<br/>it is not appropriate for a preparation specialist's time to be assigned to other programmatic<br/>uses outside of the elementary preparation program at a site even though it is acknowledged<br/>that there are many such needs.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the purchase of extra FTE prep teachers beyond the contract allocation.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By use of banked time.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site may add additional options with the approval of the parties.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubling of CSR classes is not considered a class size violation.</p>
<p>5.4.23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time scheduled for elementary special subjects teachers in each elementary school shall be rounded upward to</p>
<p>the nearest whole day.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elimination&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost prep time during weeks with holidays. (See Appendix F)</p>
<p>5.4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prep time loss during weeks with holidays and during shortened and/or early days will be made up by using one<br/>or more of the following options.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools calling substitutes.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment for prep loss. Payment will be based on the pro-rated higher substitute cost.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banked inservice prep time. During each of the 328 minute staff development days, all elementary<br/>teachers will receive 45 minutes of prep time.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prep time received during staff development days will be considered as banked time to be used<br/>during incomplete school weeks with holidays, or during shortened and/or early days when<br/>normally scheduled prep cannot be provided.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff development days must comply with legal requirements and must not exceed the teacher's<br/>regular day.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescheduling of prep time. This can include rotation of regular prep periods during the school year.</p>
<p>5.4.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All special class teachers as defined by Special Education shall, at the teachers' discretion provide themselves</p>
<p>preparation time equal to the preparation time provided other teachers in their school. The site administrator shall<br/>assist in the implementation of this preparation period.</p>
<p>5.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children's Center teachers shall be provided 150 minutes of duty-free preparation time per week.</p>
<p>Scheduling of the preparation time shall be the responsibility of the site administrator. The site administrator will<br/>confer with the teachers on this matter.</p>
<p>5.4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation time will be prorated based on the proportion of time a part-time Children's Center teacher is<br/>employed.</p>
<p>5.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be required to assume other duties or responsibilities during preparation time without their</p>
<p>consent, except under emergency circumstances to provide for the supervision and/or protection of students. No<br/>teacher shall be required to give up more than two (2) preparation periods for emergency situations per year,<br/>except in those schools where an alternative program has been approved by the faculty.</p>

<p>Principles and Purposes of Professional Evaluation</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of an evaluation system for teachers and employees serving in teacher related positions is the<br/>identification, reinforcement and improvement of skills, attitudes, and abilities which will result in better<br/>educational opportunities for all students. It is the intent of the parties that timelines apply to all teachers. The<br/>purpose of these guidelines is to insure that the evaluation of District professional personnel shall:</p>
<p>Meet the requirements of state law as set forth in Education Code Sections 44500,44660-44664, AB 954 which is<br/>included in the amended Education Code 44664 and conform in principle to the guidelines established by the<br/>State Board of Education.</p>
<p>Provide for the establishment of standards of expected student achievement at each grade level in each area of<br/>study as expressed in the District's courses of study, guides, and adopted standards aligned instructional materials,<br/>and for the evaluation and assessment of certificated employee competency as it reasonably relates to: 1) the<br/>engagement and support of all students in learning; 2) die performance of those non-instructional duties and<br/>responsibilities, including supervisory and advisory duties, as may be prescribed by the Board and SCTA<br/>contract; and 3) the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment within the scope of the<br/>employee's responsibilities; 4) understanding and organizing subject matter for student learning; 5) planning<br/>instruction and designing learning experiences for all students; and 6) assessing student learning.</p>
<p>Cover all significant aspects of professional service as set forth in the employee's job description.</p>
<p>Be conducted cooperatively with the employee accepting responsibility for self-evaluation and having full<br/>knowledge of any administrative evaluation.</p>
<p>Provide for recognition of outstanding service.</p>
<p>Provide for counseling, specific recommendations, and assistance in areas where improvement is needed.</p>
<p>Be conducted continuously and consistently in conformance with established evaluator-evaluatee relationships,<br/>written forms, channels of communication, and time requirements.</p>
<p>The evaluator shall take into account working conditions which may have an adverse impact upon the employees'<br/>abilities to perform effectively. Such conditions will be identified in the pre-conference or final conference<br/>process and shall include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Equipment, supplies, facilities</p>
<p>Teacher and student work stations</p>
<p>Problems related to sharing facilities</p>
<p>Preparation time</p>
<p>Assignments outside scope of certification, experience and/or training</p>
<p>Changes of assignment within the school year</p>
<p>Adequate orientation to policies and school practices</p>
<p>Extra-duty assignments</p>
<p>Student transiency and/or learning disparities</p>
<p>Combination classes and/or excessive class size(s)</p>

<p>Support</p>
<p>All teachers covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement will be provided the necessary components for<br/>professional teaching including the following: an appropriately furnished workstation, access to an outside<br/>phone line, instructional materials for all students using district provided curriculum/materials and/or<br/>standards aligned resources, copies of content standards or other documents of expected outcomes, necessary<br/>safety equipment, and any other specifically required by the teacher’s job.</p>
<p>Responsibility for Evaluation</p>
<p>The District shall promote and establish a satisfactory climate for evaluation by encouraging and implementing<br/>policies which contribute to high staff morale as well as promoting review and refinement of these policies.</p>
<p>The superintendent delegates to members of the executive staff the responsibility for reviewing the evaluations of<br/>personnel under their jurisdiction and implements orderly procedures by which appellant members may be heard.</p>
<p>The responsibility for the formal evaluation of bargaining unit members assigned to a specific school or other<br/>administrative unit rests with the principal and/or administrator in charge. Such evaluation is to be based upon<br/>observation and/or review of the employee's work as specified in the unit member's specification. Observation is<br/>to be spaced over a sufficient period of time for adequate sampling of the employee's performance.</p>
<p>Other data which may be included in evaluation shall be mutually agreed to in writing by the evaluatee and the</p>
<p>evaluator.</p>
<p>The principal or administrator in charge is responsible for the final evaluation of the evaluatee; however, input<br/>from department chairpersons, as permitted by their job specifications, is not precluded.</p>
<p>All written materials upon which the evaluation is based must be a matter of record and shall be shared with the<br/>evaluatee at the final evaluation conference. The evaluator shall not base evaluation of a certificated employee on<br/>any information which was not collected through the established process. Hearsay or anonymous statements shall<br/>be excluded from written evaluations.</p>
<p>Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>Frequency of evaluation: Evaluation of bargaining unit members shall be conducted on a continuing basis, at<br/>least once each school year for all personnel classified as probationary or temporary, or at least every other year<br/>for all those who have achieved permanent status, unless they have been surplused or have transferred, in which<br/>case they may be evaluated in the first year of their new assignment or at least every five (5) years for those<br/>certificated employees qualifying for AB 954 as identified below in 6.3.1(a). Permanent personnel whose social<br/>security numbers end with an even number are to be evaluated in school years which end in even numbered years;<br/>those whose social security numbers end with an odd number are to be evaluated in school years which end in<br/>odd numbered years. Personnel reassigned from one classification to another shall be evaluated at least once each<br/>school year for the first three (3) years of service in the new classification, and at least eveiy other year thereafter.<br/>An employee who has been evaluated and whose summary rating indicates that performance needs improvement<br/>or is unacceptable must be evaluated again the following year.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition of Teacher Meeting or Exceeding Standards</p>
<p>AB 954 allows for the evaluation and assessment of the performance of each certificated employee at<br/>least every five (5) years for personnel with permanent status who have been employed at least ten (10)<br/>years with the school district, are highly qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801, and whose<br/>previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards if the evaluator and<br/>certificated employee being evaluated agree. The certificated employee or the evaluator may withdraw<br/>consent at any time.</p>
<p>Eligibility criteria for AB 954: the teacher is a permanent employee with ten (10) years experience with<br/>the district and met or exceeded standards in the previous evaluation. The Highly Qualified Teacher<br/>(HQT) criteria will be considered only when applicable to the bargaining unit member’s current<br/>assignment. There must be agreement between the principal and employee.</p>
<p>The Parties agree that the five (5) year cycle of AB 954 shall be available for teachers scheduled to be<br/>evaluated in 2004-2005 and meet the above-cited criteria. Those teachers will not be evaluated for<br/>2004-2005 if they meet the above-cited criteria and the evaluator and certificated employee agree.</p>
<p>6.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should an administrator determine that a need exists to evaluate a teacher during a non-designated year, said<br/>administrator shall notify the teacher of the proposed evaluation. Such notification shall be in writing stating<br/>reason(s) for such decision. However, all provisions of this Article shall apply to the evaluation.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, mitigating circumstances may arise which require modification of the<br/>process. Such modification shall be determined jointly by the evaluatee and the evaluator. The determination of<br/>new evaluation processes shall be arrived at in accordance with this policy.</p>
<p>6.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mitigating circumstances consist of a change of the principal or administrator in charge following the<br/>pre-evaluation conference, but prior to February 10th, the evaluation process may be completed, at the District's<br/>option, by one of the following methods (the methods listed in this provision apply to all certificated staff): (1)<br/>the prior evaluator shall complete the process; (2) the new evaluator and the evaluatee shall meet and share all<br/>written data compiled by the prior evaluator and reach agreement to continue the evaluation process; or (3) the<br/>new evaluator and the evaluatee may, by mutual agreement, commence a new evaluation process by extension of<br/>evaluation times subject to section 6.3.3.1. If a principal or administrator in charge is changed following<br/>February 10, the evaluation shall be completed by the original evaluator or by a process agreed to by the<br/>evaluatee.</p>
<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferences,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Channels</p>
<p>6.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate assessment techniques and other responsibilities applicable to the evaluation shall be determined by<br/>the evaluatee and the evaluator in conference not later than November 1 of each year. In the event illness or<br/>other absence of any of the parties involved prevents holding such conference by November 1, the date shall be<br/>extended until at least one (1) week following return from such absence. Further, if other unforeseen difficulties<br/>arise, the November 1 date may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Extensions beyond January 1<br/>are subject to the approval of the superintendent, or his/her designee. The final evaluation may be extended for<br/>the same reasons and under the same conditions but not later than May 1.</p>
<p>(a) The parties have agreed to replace the former teacher evaluation (reference number 40-07112) derived from<br/>the “Classification Specification for the Teacher,” revision date 03-15-73 with the Standards-based<br/>Evaluation Instrument and Evaluation Process (reference number PSL-F107).</p>
<p>1. Option 1: Used for all teachers in probationary and temporary status on an annual basis and every other<br/>year when in permanent status. The evaluation instrument reflects the six (6) areas of the California<br/>Standards of the Teaching Profession and utilizes criteria that are observable, measurable, and<br/>applicable in all segments, kindergarten through adult education. (Applicable to those teachers formerly<br/>evaluated on the “Classroom Teacher” evaluation instrument.)</p>
<p>Observations for Option 1: There shall be two (2) formal observations for permanent teachers and<br/>three (3) or more for probationary and temporary teachers.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>2. Option 2: Serves as an alternative assessment for teachers wishing to choose the substance of the<br/>evaluation criteria for personal professional growth. The HQT criteria will be considered only when<br/>applicable to the bargaining unit member’s current assignment. This formative assessment must be<br/>focused on student achievement and relate to student learning and instructional strategies.</p>
<p>Eligibility Criteria for Option 2: Qualifying teachers must have five (5) years experience teaching in<br/>the district and two (2) consecutive formal evaluations with all performance areas marked as Consistent<br/>with Performance Standards or Exceeds Performance Standards. If referring to the previously used<br/>evaluation instruments (those used prior to the 2004-2005 school year), all performance standards are<br/>rated as l’s and2’s.</p>
<p>Expectations for Option 2: The teacher will complete a self-selected project that demonstrates<br/>professional growth.</p>
<p>3. Option AB 954: Allows for the evaluation and assessment of the performance of each certificated<br/>employee at least every five (5) years for personnel with permanent status who have been employed at<br/>least ten (10) years with the school district, are highly qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801, and<br/>whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards if the evaluator and<br/>certificated employee being evaluated agree. The certificated employee or the evaluator may withdraw<br/>consent at any time.</p>
<p>Eligibility criteria for AB 954: The teacher is a permanent employee with ten (10) years experience<br/>with the district and met or exceeded standards in the previous evaluation. The HQT criteria will be<br/>considered only when applicable to the bargaining unit member’s current assignment. There must be<br/>agreement between the principal and employee.</p>
<p>(b) Pre-Evaluation Conference Form: The evaluator and evaluatee will utilize a form developed by the<br/>District and SCTA.</p>
<p>6 3.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee shall be responsible for all aspects of the educational program for which the employee is</p>
<p>reasonably accountable.</p>
<p>6333 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of publishers norms established by standardized tests is inappropriate in the evaluation and/or assessment</p>
<p>of certificated employees and shall not be used.</p>
<p>6.3.3 .4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any deficiency of performance is noted during an observation, the evaluator shall within six (6) working days</p>
<p>make specific written recommendations to the evaluatee that shall aid the evaluatee in remediating the deficiency.<br/>The written recommendations shall become a part of the evaluation data.</p>
<p>63.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee's evaluator shall assist in correction of any cited deficiencies. Such action shall include</p>
<p>specific, objective, written recommendations for improvement as well as assistance in meeting such<br/>recommendations.</p>
<p>6.3.3.6 Recommendations for improvement should include the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citing those teaching skills and interactional relationships which require improvement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prescribing specific practices, techniques, and classroom management skills that will correct the<br/>observed problems.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Report Conferences</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preceding the date for submitting the required evaluation report, the evaluator shall meet with each employee</p>
<p>subject to evaluation, in conference, at which time the quality of the employee's work shall be discussed,<br/>including specific, job-related suggestions for performance improvement. The evaluation criteria and the formal,<br/>written report shall be the basis of the discussion.</p>

<p>A certificated employee shall have the right to initiate written reaction or response to his/her evaluation. Such<br/>written response shall become a permanent attachment to the appropriately executed evaluation instmment.</p>
<p>Evaluation Reports</p>
<p>Evaluation reports of members of the bargaining unit who are subject to evaluation as specified in this section<br/>shall be completed and submitted to the designated reviewing official not later than April 1. For those bargaining<br/>unit members referenced in 6.3.3.1 (a) whose performance is less than satisfactory the evaluator shall notify the<br/>employee, in writing, of such deficiency, and at the same time describe said inadequacy in detail with written<br/>prescription for remediation for teachers not meeting Performance Standards in any area. The evaluator shall<br/>assist the evaluatee in implementing the prescribed remediation within a reasonable time period prior to<br/>completion and submission of the evaluation report and the recommendation for retention or dismissal.</p>
<p>Except as provided in 6.3.2 and 6.3.3.1, failure to meet the April 1 deadline shall negate the administrator's<br/>evaluation of the teacher at that school site.</p>
<p>District level committees shall be formed on an ad hoc basis to serve as the final authority for resolving<br/>disagreements between the evaluator and the evaluatee which may arise over the appropriateness of the evaluation<br/>criteria and/or ratings of less than &quot;satisfactory&quot; or, for those teachers referenced in 6.3.3.1 (a), Not Meeting<br/>Performance Standards in any area.</p>
<p>The committee shall be composed of two (2) members appointed by the exclusive representative and two (2)<br/>appointed by the superintendent or designee. The superintendent will nominate eight (8) members of his/her<br/>administrative staff and the Association will choose the chairperson from among the eight (8). The chairperson<br/>shall vote only in the event of a tie.</p>
<p>The committee decision shall be in writing and shall set forth reasons for the decision rendered.</p>
<p>At the time of the hearing, the evaluatee and the two members appointed by the exclusive representative shall be<br/>released without loss of pay or leave during the necessary proceedings.</p>
<p>Teacher Improvement Plans</p>
<p>For those teachers referenced in 6.3.3.1 (a) whose previous summary rating reflects less than a 3, a written plan<br/>for improvement shall be developed in concert between the teacher and the evaluator. Such plan should be based<br/>on Sections 6.3.3.4, 6.3.3.5, and 6.3.3.6 of this Article.</p>
<p>After a reasonable period of time, but not more than twenty (20) working days after the plan is initiated, the<br/>administrator in charge, or administrative designee, shall observe the teacher in various teaching situations. The<br/>administrator designee, shall counsel with the evaluatee on observed progress and shall make known in writing to<br/>the evaluatee progress observed and improvements still to be achieved.</p>
<p>Release time shall be provided when required by the nature of the program or plan.</p>
<p>When the program incorporates released time or travel for observation of designated teachers at other locations or<br/>classes of any kind, such program shall not require costs to the employee unless agreed to by the employee.</p>
<p>When the plan includes peer participation, including the assignment of a mentor teacher by the evaluator, the<br/>relationship between the participating teacher and his or her peer shall be confidential. The peer shall not<br/>participate in the evaluation of the employee.</p>
<p>For those teachers referenced in 6.3.1 (a), if the fourth (4<sup>th</sup>) column from the teacher performance areas is checked,<br/>the evaluator must indicate what areas do not meet performance standards. The evaluator and teacher shall<br/>develop an improvement plan following the evaluation addressing those areas needing improvement.</p>

<p>In order to provide competent personnel it is very important that principals evaluate their substitute teachers. It<br/>shall be the responsibility of the Personnel Services Office to provide rating forms for this purpose. A principal<br/>need rate a substitute only once unless there is reason to change the rating already on file. If a principal does not<br/>want a particular substitute to serve in his/her school, the reasons for such request must be indicated on the<br/>evaluation form. A principal shall, when requested by the substitute, be responsible to conference with the<br/>substitute within three (3) days of such request.</p>
<p>Substitutes have the right to request an evaluation after three (3) days of employment at a school.</p>
<p>Upon request substitutes have the right to conference with the superintendent or his/her designee regarding their<br/>evaluation. During such conferences the substitutes will be provided with written information regarding<br/>individual evaluations if they so request.</p>
<p>Any performance rating or evaluation of per session personnel who are members of the bargaining unit shall be<br/>done with the full knowledge of the evaluatee.</p>
<p>The evaluator shall be responsible for insuring that all evaluation data, including information and related forms,<br/>are handled in such a manner so as to protect their confidentiality.</p>
<p>Evaluation Forms</p>
<p>Attached and incorporated into this Agreement as Appendix A is an evaluation form incorporating class<br/>specifications for each job classification in the bargaining unit agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p>a. Attached and incorporated into this Agreement as part of Appendix A is the Standards-based Evaluation<br/>Instrument and Evaluation Process (reference number PSL-F107) which the parties have mutually agreed to<br/>replace the former teacher evaluation (reference number 40-07112) derived from the “Classification<br/>Specification for the Teacher,” revision date 03-15-73.</p>
<p>These evaluation forms will be attached only to the two (2) executed copies of the contract.</p>
<p>It is understood by the parties that during the term of this Agreement changes will be made to the substance of<br/>these forms only by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>An assignment is defined as the classes that a teacher is assigned to teach.</p>
<p>For members of the bargaining unit without classroom duties, an assignment is defined as the specific site(s) to<br/>which they are assigned to perform their duties.</p>
<p>An assignment change is a change of grade, class, department, or for those teachers referred to in 7.1.1, a change<br/>in sites without a change in classification.</p>
<p>All assignments shall be made taking into account credential limitations, major or minor fields of study, training,<br/>previous experience, and consideration of the qualifications of the local staff which are judged to be essential for<br/>the effective operation of the school.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal and the teachers at each site will collaboratively make track and grade change decisions.<br/>If consensus cannot be reached, the principal will make the assignment.

If the<br/>requested leave is for pregnancy, the application form shall be accompanied by a written statement by the<br/>employee's physician specifying: f) The expected date of birth, 2) the length of time the physician believes she<br/>can continue working without endangering her own health and safety, and 3) the approximate length of time the<br/>physician believes she will be incapacitated related to the birth.</p>
<p>Parental leave may be granted for up to the balance of a school year and may be extended up to a maximum of<br/>four (4) semesters.</p>
<p>During the parental leave, any illness for which accumulated sick leave could be used under District rules and<br/>regulations will be paid upon proper application and certification by a physician.</p>
<p>In case of terminated pregnancy, an employee on parental leave may return to service if a position for which she<br/>is qualified is open, and upon the written statement of a physician that such employee is physically able to<br/>perform normal duties. When the employee's original position becomes available at the end of the specified leave<br/>period, the employee shall then have the right to return to that position.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of service to the District;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History of leaves granted to the applicant.</p>
<p>No sabbatical leaves shall be granted to applicants whose overall evaluation is below standards.</p>

If any applicant granted a<br/>leave by the Board later cancels it, the next ranking applicant shall be recommended.</p>
<p>Not more than one percent (1%) of the total certificated staff shall be on sabbatical leave at any one time.</p>
<p>Following the granting of a sabbatical leave by the Board, a contract of agreement shall be completed, giving all<br/>essential details such as effective beginning and terminating dates, number of semester units of credit to be earned<br/>or other purposes to be fulfilled, name of institution where work is to be done, if any, salary and method of<br/>payment, agreement to serve the District upon return for a period which is equal to twice the period of the leave,<br/>agreement to notify the District of intentions regarding returning not later than thirty (30) days prior to<br/>termination of the leave, agreement to submit required reports upon return as required herein, and agreement to<br/>refund sabbatical salary as prescribed herein if conditions of the leave are not fulfilled.

If an employee does not serve the District after return for a period<br/>which is equal to twice the period of the leave, he/she shall refund to the District an amount which bears the same<br/>proportion to the total compensation received while on leave as the amount of time which was not served bears to<br/>the total amount of time agreed upon.</p>

<p>Time spent on sabbatical leave shall count toward earned salary increments in the same manner as regular service.<br/>Any special grants or salary increases allowed all regularly certificated staff members while an employee is on<br/>sabbatical leave shall be allowed such employee upon return.</p>
<p>At the expiration of the sabbatical leave the employee, unless agreed otherwise, or unless the particular position<br/>shall have been eliminated, shall be reinstated in the position held at the time such sabbatical leave was entered<br/>upon.</p>

<p>A letter of certification by a member of the faculty of an accredited four-year college or university describing the<br/>nature of the work completed and verifying that it was equivalent in effort and content to the units in 9.5.13.1<br/>above, if the leave was for independent study or research.</p>
<p>A typed report of not less than 1500 words describing activities and benefits derived while on leave, if the leave<br/>was for travel.</p>
<p>The superintendent's designee may verify that the purposes of the leave were fulfilled or, if in doubt, shall refer<br/>the verification received to the District Certificated Professional Improvement Committee fora recommendation.<br/>If it is concluded that the purposes were not fulfilled, the employee may appeal to the Certificated Professional<br/>Improvement Committee by appearing before it in person. If the appeal is not sustained, the employee shall<br/>reimburse the District for the salary received while on leave or such part thereof as the committee may<br/>recommend, subject to review and approval by the superintendent.</p>
<p>If an employee on sabbatical leave suffers serious illness or injury which a qualified physician attests would<br/>prevent fulfillment of the purposes of the leave, he/she shall notify the District of this fact immediately. If the<br/>leave must be abandoned, the employee may return to District service as soon as a position for which he/she is<br/>qualified becomes available, and repayment of sabbatical salaiy shall be made as described herein. If the<br/>employee desires and a physician so recommends, the employee shall be granted a health leave of absence for the<br/>length of time recommended by the physician. At the conclusion of the health leave of absence, the employee<br/>may continue the sabbatical leave or return to service.</p>
<p>There shall be no restrictions placed upon the activities of an employee while on sabbatical leave so long as the<br/>purposes of the leave are fulfilled. Time spent on sabbatical leave shall count as regular District service in the<br/>determination of seniority, accumulation of sick leave credits, and eligibility for other fringe benefits.</p>
<p>In all matters not included in these regulations, the California Education Code shall govern sabbatical leave for<br/>this District, and all amendments to such code shall automatically affect these rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Sick Leave</p>
<p>Employee Illness</p>
<p>Ten (10) days of sick leave at Dill pay shall be accrued to each member of the bargaining unit annually for<br/>personal illness or injury at any time during a school year except that persons employed under contract in<br/>extended-year programs shall earn sick leave at the rate of one (1) day for each full calendar month of service. A<br/>full month of service shall be defined as no less than 75 percent (75%) of the required working days of any<br/>calendar month for an employee.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will continue to give full force and effect to the sick leave entitlement set forth in Article 9<br/>of the collective bargaining agreement between the Parties, although the internal reporting and accrual of<br/>such time will be described, calculated and maintained only in “hours” instead of “days.”</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accrual of sick leave in “hours” will be converted to “days” when reported to STRS, if required by<br/>STRS.</p>

<p>9.6.1.10</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s internal conversion of sick leave reporting and accrual from “days” to “hours” does not<br/>adversely affect the sick leave reporting or accrual of any SCTA unit member. For example, the<br/>standard for one-half day sick leave for a six-hour employee will continue to be three hours, even though<br/>the actual time of the sick leave could be slightly more or less than three hours, depending on the<br/>employee’s schedule.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCTA unit members shall be able to continue to utilize sick leave in one horn increments.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools and departments can continue to utilize local practices to cover for employees without sick<br/>leave deduction(s) who are absent short durations of time.</p>
<p>Sick leave up to the maximum eamable within any given school year need not be earned by an employee before it<br/>is used.</p>
<p>In case any regular employee resigns or otherwise leaves the service of the school District, after having used more<br/>sick leave days than may have been earned for any current year at the rate of one (1) day per calendar month, as<br/>defined above, plus any prior year accumulations, a deduction shall be made in the salary or wages which may be<br/>due for each day of sick leave used and not earned. In case no salary or wages are still due at time of termination<br/>of service, the employee shall be properly billed for repayment to the District of pay received for unearned sick<br/>leave days that have been used.</p>
<p>Any unused portion of sick leave shall be accumulated without limit.</p>
<p>A member of the bargaining unit, while on unpaid leave of absence granted by the Board of Education, shall<br/>maintain any sick leave credits which were accumulated prior to such leave but shall not accumulate any<br/>additional sick leave credit during the period of such leave.</p>
<p>In case an employee severs official connection with the District and is reemployed at a later date, all unused sick<br/>leave credits on file at the close of the prior employment period shall be reinstated provided, however, that<br/>reemployment must occur within thirty-nine (3 9) months after the date ending the prior employment if such sick</p>
<p>leave credits are to be reinstated.</p>
<p>For personal illness absence of any member of the bargaining unit exceeding ten (10) consecutive workdays, a<br/>physician's statement verifying the illness shall be provided by the employee in addition to the regular monthly<br/>absence report. For extended illness absence, a physician's written statement relative to necessity for continued<br/>absence is required. This requirement may be waived by the assistant superintendent. Personnel Services Office,<br/>on his own volition or upon the recommendation of the employee's immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>Nothing shall be deemed to prevent the superintendent or designee from requiring a doctor's verification as to the<br/>employee's claimed illness in any situation in which there is reasonable cause to believe that no valid grounds<br/>exist for the employee's claim of sick leave. If any employee's immediate supervisor has reasonable cause to<br/>believe that an employee has abused sick leave privileges, the supervisor shall confer with the employee giving<br/>every opportunity to establish that illness had occurred. Following such conference, if the administrative<br/>supervisor feels that sick leave privileges have been abused, such reasons shall be communicated to the employee<br/>in writing before a doctor's verification may be required.</p>
<p>After all earned sick leave days at full pay are used and illness absence continues, a member of the bargaining<br/>unit, except one employed on an hourly basis, shall receive the difference between contract daily rate and the<br/>amount paid a day-to-day substitute at the current minimum substitute rate for a period not to exceed 100 required<br/>service days. The 100 required service days period is exclusive of the earned sick leave days at full pay.</p>
<p>Absences for reasons of health for less than three (3) months are considered day-to-day illness absences, and<br/>replacement personnel, when authorized, are employed on a day-to-day substitute basis. When it is anticipated<br/>that absences related to health will extend for a period of from three (3) months to a full year, a regular employee<br/>of the District shall contact the Personnel Services Office to arrange for a formal, Board-granted health leave of<br/>absence. Such leaves may be extended beyond one year at the discretion of the Board. Since formal.<br/>Board-granted health leaves of absence are for specified periods of time, authorized replacement personnel,<br/>whenever possible, will be employed on a long-term substitute contractual basis. Health leaves of absence will be<br/>granted only upon the written recommendation of a physician and shall be subject to the approval of the<br/>superintendent. A physician's written statement that the employee is capable of resuming a full-time service is</p>

<p>also necessary upon return. All benefits and provisions related to personal illness absence as described in these<br/>regulations are applicable both to day-to-day illness absences and to formal health leaves of absence.</p>
<p>Nothing contained in these sick leave regulations shall be deemed in conflict with the provisions of the Workers'<br/>Compensation Insurance and Safety Laws.</p>
<p>All members of the bargaining unit compensated on an hourly basis shall earn one (1) hour of sick leave credit for<br/>each eighteen (18) hours of per session or Adult Education Hourly service. Personnel who are employed on a<br/>regular contract basis may not use such sick leave credits for any purpose other than for absences from per session<br/>service; however, if a per session employee is assigned contract status, the per session sick leave credits so<br/>accumulated shall be available for his/her use as a contract employee.</p>
<p>Use of Sick Leave for Compelling Personal Importance</p>
<p>Sick leave, not to exceed nine (9) days per year may, at the employee's election, be used for any of the following<br/>reasons of compelling importance. Prior approval shall not be required except to give as much notice as possible<br/>to the employee's principal or other administrator in charge so that a substitute may be obtained.</p>
<p>Death, accident, or illness involving the employee's immediate family, other relatives, or close friends; accident<br/>involving the employee's personal property or the personal property of the immediate family, other relatives, or<br/>close friends.

<p>Appearance in any court or before any administrative tribunal as a litigant, party or witness under subpoena or<br/>any order made with jurisdiction, except when acting as an agent for the District.</p>
<p>To attend religious observances or weddings, ceremonies, or traditional observances honoring the employee or<br/>members of the employee's immediate family.</p>
<p>To attend to legal or business matters which are of compelling personal importance.</p>
<p>To take examinations related to advanced training which cannot be scheduled during off-duty hours (in such cases<br/>the employee shall attach to the employee's absence report satisfactory written evidence of the requirement).</p>
<p>The following are not considered reasons of compelling personal importance: attendance at or participation in<br/>functions which are primarily for the employee's amusement, pleasure, personal convenience; the extension of<br/>holidays or vacation periods; accompanying a spouse on a trip when such travel is not otherwise authorized by<br/>these rules; seeking or engaging in other employment; engaging in a strike demonstration, picketing, lobbying,<br/>rally, march, campaign meeting, or any other activities relating to work stoppage or political campaigning.</p>
<p>The employee's election to use sick leave credits for any of the purposes allowable shall be indicated on the<br/>Employee Absence Report form which shall be attached to the payroll section's copy of the Monthly Absence<br/>Report. The employee shall check on the Employee Absence Report form the reason(s) for use of sick leave<br/>credits for reasons of compelling personal importance.</p>
<p>Those employed on an hourly basis for at least one semester for not less than ten (10) hours per week, and<br/>personnel under contract with the District, excluding summer-session per session personnel, shall enjoy the<br/>following leave provisions:</p>

<p>Step placement may be higher if experience credit has been granted at the time of initial employment in keeping<br/>with Sections 12.3.2 through 12.3.5 of this Article.</p>
<p>Persons who have reached the maximums of their salary classes, when obtaining the requirements for a higher<br/>class, shall be moved over to the new class and be placed on the step which corresponds to their years of credited<br/>service.</p>
<p>Upon employment, experience credit is granted on the basis of one (1) step for each year of properly verified<br/>comparable experience with limitations set forth in Sections 12.2.1 through 12.2.3.3 of this Article. A year of<br/>experience must represent no less than seventy-five per cent (75%) of the days of required full-time service,<br/>although full semesters will be added together, even if in separate school years, in computing years of service.<br/>Credit for part-time experience will be computed by converting to full-time experience; e.g., two (2) years of<br/>half-time experience equal one (1) step of experience credit.

Such<br/>personnel are returned to their place on the schedule in effect when they terminated, and then all schedule changes<br/>which occurred during their absence and any interim experience credit are applied to determine their placement<br/>on the present schedule.</p>
<p>Employees new to the District have a maximum of ninety (90) days from their first day of required service in<br/>which to file verifications of comparable or allied experience. After ninety days, verification canbe filed without<br/>retroactive credit.</p>
<p>A year of teaching service in the District is earned for salary schedule step placement if an employee is paid for<br/>seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the school year, including time spent on sabbatical leave of absence, or if<br/>the employee is participating in the early retirement incentive plan as set forth in P-3604 of the Board's Policies<br/>and Bylaws, as adopted on July 10. 1978.</p>

Sections P-3572 through P-3575, adopted on July 10,<br/>1978. Credits will be accepted only if they are earned in a four-year college or university accredited by a regional<br/>accrediting Association, if they are accepted by the Commission for Teacher Preparation and Licensing for<br/>credentialing purposes, or if they are reported on appropriate forms as outlined in connection with the District's<br/>Professional Improvement Program. Training classification shall be determined twice annually on July 1 and<br/>Februaiy 1, except that July 1 st class changes shall not be used in determining summer school per session rates of<br/>pay for that year.</p>
<p>Excess units are defined as those units earned in excess of the minimum requirement for the degree in the<br/>institution where the degree was granted, and may have been earned before or after the awarding of the degree.</p>

This approval will be made &quot;on the basis of a plan for the orderly and appropriate professional<br/>improvement&quot; of all employees. Approval forms for four-year college or university courses must be completed<br/>and filed with the Personnel Services Office. Approval forms for inservice courses offered by the Staff Training<br/>Services Department must be filed with that department. Approvals denied by the principals may be appealed to<br/>the assistant superintendent, Personnel Services Office.</p>
<p>Reasons for disapproval by the site administrator must be substantiated in writing and returned to the teacher<br/>within five (5) days. Failure to do so shall constitute a waiver of the site administrator's right to disapprove the</p>
<p>course(s).</p>
<p>The teacher may appeal the site administrator's disapproval to the assistant superintendent, Personnel Services<br/>Office, or. in his/her absence, the appropriate area assistant superintendent. Such appeal must be in writing and<br/>must be received in the appropriate assistant superintendent's office no later than ten (10) days after the date of<br/>the site administrator's disapproval.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of such notification, the principal should take the following courses of action as appropriate:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survey the faculty by memorandum, bulletin, or meeting, to determine if there is another individual who<br/>is qualified and interested in the extra duty assignment.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that there is a teaching vacancy to be filled, determine if it is feasible to add the extra duty<br/>to the teaching position. In making such a determination, the principal should confer with the director.<br/>Secondary Certificated Personnel Services, regarding the likelihood of applicants who would be<br/>qualified for both the teaching assignment and the extra duty.</p>
<p>If the principal is unable to fill the extra duty assignment by either course of action, he/she should then discuss<br/>with the teachers requesting withdrawal the kind of action which the teacher is willing to undertake in order to be<br/>relieved of the extra duty assignment. Such actions could include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;trading&quot; extra duty assignments with other teachers who may also be interested in a change;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requesting reassignment to a vacant teaching area in the school not associated with the extra duty</p>
<p>assignment; or</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filing a voluntary request with the Personnel Services Office for transfer to another school.</p>
<p>Such requests for transfer will be considered in keeping with the sections governing transfers in Article 8of this<br/>contract.</p>
<p>If none of these options are available to the teacher, or if the teacher is unwilling to pursue them, the principal<br/>may continue to hold the teacher responsible for the extra duty assignment during the ensuing school year, in<br/>which case the request for withdrawal will remain in effect unless withdrawn by the teacher.</p>
<p>A teacher losing his/her classes related to his/her extra duty assignment shall have the option of withdrawing from<br/>that assignment.</p>
<p>It is understood by the parties that teachers not already involved in non-athletic coaching assignments shall not be<br/>required to assume any such assignments.</p>
<p>A teacher assuming classes that have a related activity is obligated to assume responsibility for that related<br/>activity.</p>
<p>The CIF required coaching days prior to the first day of school shall be compensated for and included in the extra<br/>duty stipend.</p>
<p>The secondary principals acting in committee, as a whole, will establish District-wide minimum requirements for<br/>activities not covered by league rules.</p>
<p>The parties agree that transportation for athletics and other school activities covered by present District policy<br/>shall be considered a budget priority.</p>
<p>Regular contract teachers who also are assigned extra duty coaching assignments will receive equal treatment and<br/>the same protection granted to all members of the bargaining unit which derive from the current Agreement<br/>between the parties.</p>
<p>It is further understood by the parties that a joint Board/Association committee (five [5] members to be selected<br/>by each party) will be appointed no later than thirty (30) days following the effective date of this Article, to<br/>conduct an annual review of the extra pay for extra duty schedule. The tasks of the committee shall be to review<br/>existing positions for proper categorical placement on the schedule and to consider addition or deletion of any<br/>position.

The .50% additional Health &amp; Welfare savings as well as the additional .25% PARS<br/>savings are specific savings due only to the SCTA bargaining unit.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase that would apply to extra duty stipends will be held in abeyance to allow the parties to<br/>consider changes to the extra duty schedule issues related to gender, uniformity and mileage stipends.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to continue to work through February 15,2005, to add one-quarter percent (.25%) to<br/>the 1.75% to reach a goal of two percent (2.0%) for 2004-2005.

<p>Total Compensation Increase for 2005-06 and 2006-07</p>
<p>The parties agree to develop a mutually agreeable formula upon which a total compensation increase might be<br/>based by February 15, 2005, unless the parties mutually agree to extend the timeline; however, if there is no<br/>agreement on such a formula, the parties agree that the contract will be reopened for negotiations per the CB A in<br/>years two (2) and three (3) as it relates to total compensation.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon implementation of the mutually agreeable formula, the parties agree that if there is a disagreement<br/>over the percentage or if additional funds are necessary to achieve such increase, the parties agree to<br/>meet in committee to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties also agree if they are unable to resolve the matter that either party may request to renegotiate<br/>total compensation. Any changes to the CBA will be subject to mutual agreement. Nothing herein<br/>precludes the parties from identifying additional funds for additional increases.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the process for applying the calculation of any increase will begin September 15<sup>th<br/></sup>or thirty (30) working days after the adoption of the State budget which ever is later. The process will<br/>include the District’s notice to SCTA regarding the results of the calculation. SCTA or the District will<br/>then have the opportunity to avail the parties of the procedures outlined in 12.13.1 (a)andor 12.13.1 (b)<br/>above.</p>

<p>Two selection committees shall be established to recommend mentor teacher candidates to the Board of<br/>Education. The selection committees will recommend alternates to the Mentor Teacher Program if there are more<br/>qualified candidates than authorized mentor teacher openings. One selection committee will choose candidates<br/>from the K-6 segment, the other committee will select candidates from the 7-12 and Adult segment. Each<br/>committee shall be eleven (11) members, each committee shall be comprised of six (6) teachers and five (5)<br/>administrators. The committee members shall select from their members a chairperson by a majority vote. The<br/>committees shall be called into session, thereafter, as need dictates, but always within one year of the last<br/>selection committee meeting. Vacancies on the committee may be filled as needed by the District or the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>The selection committees shall develop, adopt, and use such procedures as are appropriate to their tasks. The<br/>selection process shall include provisions for evaluating the effectiveness of former and current mentor teachers<br/>who are applying for selection.</p>
<p>The Selection Committee's process shall also include an effort to spread equitably mentors throughout the<br/>District's schools.</p>

If either segment cannot utilize its full share of mentor positions (slots)<br/>because there are fewer applications than available positions, the excess positions above the number of<br/>applications shall be assigned to the other segment committee. If any positions remain after both segments have<br/>completed their nominations, the District may institute a second selection process using the same selection<br/>committees to utilize the remaining positions after conducting a new application process. The same proportionate<br/>relationship shall be used in allocating the remaining positions.</p>
<p>The selection committees shall begin work not later than March 1 and shall complete their nominations not later<br/>than May 2 preceding the school year in which mentors are to begin terms of office. Modifications to the<br/>selection process timeliness may be made in years when the State Department of Education or the legislature<br/>modifies, reduces or increases funding. Any changes to the selection process timeliness will be approved by<br/>SCTA and the District.</p>
<p>Selection committee members shall be provided release time for observation and related evaluation activities. In<br/>addition, each SCTA bargaining unit member shall be compensated at the amount specified on Category F of the<br/>extra duty schedule for eachyeaf s round of mentor selection.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half day of release (may, if required by the Committee Chair) be provided at the outset of the process<br/>for any necessary organizational and informational purposes.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member committee members shall be paid in full within one month of the completion of the<br/>selection process. Actual mileage pay will be reimbursed upon receipt of the appropriate forms.</p>
<p>If selection committee meetings are to be held at times outside of the teacher's normal school day, the meetings<br/>are not to be scheduled until all teacher committee members have completed their normal school day with<br/>sufficient added time necessary for all teachers to reach the agreed upon meeting site. All teacher members of<br/>the committee shall be given the opportunity to share equally in remuneration for time served.</p>
<p>A mentor teacher candidate must give permission in writing before committee members may use pertinent<br/>personnel file entries in their selection process.</p>
<p>The Association shall select the teacher members of the selection committees.</p>
<p>It is agreed that if the Association has not appointed these committee members by January 1 preceding the school<br/>year in which mentor teachers are to begin terms of office, the District may implement a committee nomination<br/>and selection procedure to fulfill the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Persons designated as mentor teachers shall be responsible for developing a plan which may include duties and<br/>responsibilities in accordance with the following and subject to consultation and mutual agreement with the<br/>supervisor assigned by the superintendent or his designee:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary function of a mentor teacher shall be to provide assistance and guidance to probationary<br/>and temporary teachers. A mentor teacher may also provide assistance and guidance to permanent<br/>teachers when the permanent teacher and site administrator mutually agree to that practice.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentor teachers may provide staff development for teachers and may develop special curriculum.</p>
<p>A mentor teacher shall not participate in the evaluation of teachers.</p>
<p>Mentor teachers must be allocated an annual stipend of no less than $4,312. This $4,312 must be over and above<br/>the regular salary to which the teacher is entitled. Payments shall be made in four (4) equal installments upon<br/>submission of appropriate pay claims approved by the mentor teachers' supervisor (contingent upon state<br/>funding).</p>
<p>The mentor support funds to support the activities of individual mentor teachers will be available to the mentor<br/>upon receipt of an appropriate request documenting the relationship of the proposed expenditures to that<br/>individual mentor plan.</p>
<p>If for any reason a mentor teacher is unable to complete the designated mentoring period, the Board of Education<br/>may select a replacement from committee-nominated alternates.</p>
<p>Failure to prepare and submit a contract to the supervisor within 90 days after Board of Education approval shall<br/>mean that the mentor is unable to fulfill mentor responsibilities. The mentor teacher will be notified and an<br/>alternate mentor appointed.</p>
<p>All teachers selected in 1990 or thereafter will serve a two-year term plus an additional two-year term provided<br/>the mentor teacher fully meets, or has fully met, the agreed upon plan per 20.4. At the conclusion of the second<br/>two-year term, a mentor teacher will not be eligible to reapply for a period equivalent to one school year. At the<br/>conclusion of this one year hiatus, any former mentor teacher will be eligible to apply. The actual number<br/>selected in any one year may be affected by increases or decreases in state funding of the program, and/or by<br/>early termination or resignation from mentor teacher status.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>20.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any disputes related to the mentor teacher plan between the mentor teacher and the supervisor shall be reviewed<br/>by a mentor peer committee. The rules and imposition for such committee shall be determined by the mentors at<br/>a staff meeting. Resolution of disputes shall be final and not subject to the grievance process per Article 4.</p>
<p>20.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours of service outside the regular teaching day shall be determined by the assigned supervisor after<br/>consultation and mutual agreement with the mentor teacher. The maximum number of additional hours required<br/>shall be determined by dividing the stipend amount by the contract hourly rate for Class C, Step 14.</p>
<p>Example: $165.49 (Class C, Step 14 daily rate) X. 1538 equals $25.45. $4,000 (annual stipend) divided by 25.45<br/>equals 157.17 hours.</p>
<p>20.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mentor teacher shall spend not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of his/her time in the direct instruction of<br/>pupils. &quot;Direct instruction of pupils,&quot; except as it applies to resource teachers, shall be construed to require a<br/>mentor teacher to instruct his or her regularly assigned pupils.</p>
<p>20.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mentor teacher shall be reimbursed at the standard rate for each mile traveled on District business provided<br/>the teacher turns in the appropriate forms.</p>
<p>20.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mentor teacher is released from his/her regular teaching assignment to perform duties and<br/>responsibilities associated with the mentor teacher program, he/she may request a substitute of his/her choice.</p>
<p>20.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any released time for the mentor teacher may not raise the student-teacher ratio of any other teachers.</p>
<p>20.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No preparation time of any teacher shall be used to provide released time for a mentor teacher, except by mutual<br/>agreement of the affected teacher and the site administrator.</p>
<p>20.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mentor teacher shall maintain the confidentiality of all information related to the teachers for whom he/she<br/>may serve as mentor.</p>
<p>20.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mentor teacher shall not be exempt from regular transfer procedures because of mentor teacher designation.<br/>The designation, mentor teacher, is excluded as a &quot;compelling&quot; reason to maintain a teacher on a school site.</p>
<p>20.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuance of the mentor program and the number of mentors to be selected each year is dependent upon the<br/>funding received by the District from the California State Department of Education for the Mentor Teacher<br/>Program.</p>
<p>20.13.1 All financial expenditures for the Mentor Teacher Program shall be confined to the allocations from the State<br/>Department of Education designated solely for the Mentor Teacher Program. There shall be no encroachment of<br/>the SB 813 Mentor Teacher Program on other District funds.</p>
<p>20.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District shall jointly develop a Mentor Program Contract that shall be signed by the<br/>mentor teacher and appropriate District administrators). Such contract form shall become part of this Agreement<br/>as an appendix.</p>

Such notice shall constitute the District's sole<br/>obligation with respect to unit members claiming an exemption. Thereafter, the Association may challenge the<br/>claimed exemption through pursuit of a small claims court action, or by initiating other legal action including use<br/>of the arbitration procedure contained in this Agreement. In any such proceeding, the District shall serve as a<br/>nominal parly to ensure standing and to carry out the determination of the court or an arbitrator where a decision<br/>directs the District to withhold agency fees as provided in Section 21.3.1.
