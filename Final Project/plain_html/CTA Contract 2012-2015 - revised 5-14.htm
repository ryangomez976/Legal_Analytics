<p>ARTICLE 1: AGREEMENT</p>
<p>This Agreement is made and entered into this 1st day of July 2012, between the Anderson Union High<br/>School District (hereinafter referred to as &quot;District&quot;) and the Anderson Union High School District<br/>Teachers Association, an affiliate of the California Teachers Association (hereinafter referred to as<br/>&quot;Association&quot;). This Agreement will cover the period of time from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2015<br/>and supersedes the previous agreements between the parties. Any compensation items negotiated for<br/>2013-14 become effective July 1, 2013.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2: RECOGNITION</p>
<p>The District confirms its recognition of the Association as the exclusive representative for those<br/>certificated employees in the representation unit recognized by the District per its resolution at the<br/>meeting of the Governing Board of May 17, 1976. This Agreement applies only to regular District<br/>employees included in the above representation unit, excluding substitute Certificated employees.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3: NEGOTIATION</p>
<p>The District and Association shall present their initial proposals for negotiations for the following year in<br/>writing, to the other party, by May 15th each year. This agreement shall be subject to annual salary<br/>negotiations, including extra duty pay assignments, and health and welfare benefits, for the term of this<br/>agreement. Furthermore, it is agreed and understood that the District and Association may reopen an<br/>additional two (2) articles each to be considered as subject to renegotiations at the time that the<br/>salaries and benefits are annually renegotiated.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4: EMPLOYEE RIGHTS</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize the right of employees to form, join and participate in lawful<br/>activities of employee organizations and the equal right of employees to refuse to form, join and<br/>participate in employee organization activities.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5: REPRESENTATION FEE AND MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP</p>
<p>5.1 Employee Rights</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the right of employees to form, join and<br/>participate in lawful activities of employee organizations and the equal, alternative right<br/>of employees to refuse to form, join and participate in employee organizations. Neither<br/>party shall exert pressure upon nor discriminate against an employee in the exercise of<br/>these alternative rights. Accordingly, membership in the Association shall not be<br/>compulsory.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member has the right to choose either to become a member of the Association or<br/>to pay to the Association a fee for representation services, or to refrain from either of the<br/>above courses of action upon the grounds set forth in Section 5.6 below.</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll Deductions</p>
<p>5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall be provided continuous payroll deductions of membership dues,<br/>including the dues of the State organization. The Association agrees to furnish any<br/>information needed by the District to fulfill the provisions of this Section.</p>
<p>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association is entitled to a change in payroll deductions of its member(s) provided<br/>an authorized Association officer submits a written request to the District for such<br/>adjustment; and provided further that at least 30 calendar days prior to the change an<br/>authorized Association officer shall furnish the District with evidence that the Association<br/>provided notification to its members of said change. Such changes shall consist of total<br/>annual dues change, increase or decrease in dues requirements, increase or decrease in<br/>authorized deductions by a member(s) for Association approved items.</p>
<p>5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall remit all dues collected to the Association with an accompanying<br/>alphabetical list of all unit members for whom all dues deductions have been made.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Method and Association Certification Requirements</p>
<p>5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who does not fall within the exempted categories as set forth<br/>in Section 5.6 below, and who has not voluntarily made application for membership in<br/>the Association within the 60th day following either the date upon which the results of<br/>the separate election provided for in the Sections above are finally certified pursuant to<br/>the rules and regulations governing the Public Employment Relations Board, or, the date<br/>upon which said employee has been formally hired by the District as a bargaining unit<br/>employee, must as a condition of continued employment in the District pay to the<br/>Association a service fee.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member does not become a member of the Association or pay<br/>such fee directly to the Association, the District shall begin automatic payroll deduction<br/>in the same manner as set forth in Section 5.2 of this Agreement and pursuant to the<br/>Education Code.</p>
<p>5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the beginning of such automatic payroll deduction, the Association will certify to<br/>the District in writing that:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee whose pay is to be affected by the deduction has:<br/>refused to join the association;</p>
<p>refused to tender the amount of the service fee as defined herein;<br/>not applied for an exemption under Section 5.6 herein; and</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association is complying with current Public Employment Relations Board<br/>Regulations regarding &quot;Notification of Non-member,&quot; &quot;Filing of Financial<br/>Reports,&quot; &quot;Agency Fee Appeal,&quot; &quot;Escrow of Agency Fees in Dispute,&quot; and &quot;Filing of<br/>Agency Fee Appeal Procedure.&quot;</p>
<p>CTA Agreement</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>The written certification in Section 5.3.3 above shall be a condition precedent to any<br/>collection of the service fee by the District.</p>
<p>The District is under no obligation to make payroll deductions for periods during which a<br/>unit member is either terminated from active employment or not on the District's active<br/>payroll for any reason, including, but not limited to, layoff and voluntary leave of<br/>absence for more than three days.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member's earnings must be sufficient after other legal and required<br/>deductions are made to cover the amount of the dues or service fees to be<br/>deducted.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is in a non-pay status for an entire pay period, no<br/>withholding will be made to cover the pay period. In the case of a unit member<br/>who is in a non-pay status during only part of the pay period, and the salary is<br/>not sufficient to cover the full withholding, no deduction shall be made. All other<br/>legal and required deductions have priority over Association dues and service<br/>fees.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of Service Fee</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service fee collected from bargaining unit members pursuant to Section 5.7 shall be<br/>that allowed by Section 3540.1(i)(2) of the Government Code.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time, non-exempt bargaining unit members hired during the school year shall join<br/>the Association or pay a prorated service fee. Part-time, non-exempt bargaining unit<br/>members shall join the Association or pay a prorated service fee. Unit members on leave<br/>without pay, and unit members who are on laid-off status shall be exempt from these<br/>provisions herein; except that the election as to membership or payment of a fee as set<br/>forth herein must be exercised within the first ten work days upon return to paid status.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute as to the amount of the service fee shall be resolved pursuant to the current<br/>regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Verification of Service Fee by Association</p>
<p>The Association shall file in a timely manner with the District a copy of the written notice</p>
<p>required by the regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board to be sent to non-</p>
<p>Association members subject to the service fee.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members Exempted from Obligation to Pay Service Fee</p>
<p>5.6.1 Any unit member shall be exempted from the requirements of a service fee if such unit<br/>member is a member of a bona fide religion, body or sect which has historically held<br/>objections to joining or financially supporting a &quot;public employee organization&quot; as<br/>defined by Section 3540.1(d) of the Gov. Code.</p>

<p>5.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such exempt unit member shall, as an alternative to payment of a service fee to the<br/>Association, pay an amount equivalent to such service fee to any charity jointly agreed<br/>upon by the District and the Association which is exempt from taxation under the<br/>Internal Revenue Code. Such charities cannot be affiliated in any manner with the<br/>Association, nor can such charities be related to an established religious organization.</p>
<p>5.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may, upon written request to the unit member, require the exempt unit<br/>member to submit an affidavit explaining the basis for the unit member's objection to<br/>the payment of the service fee.</p>
<p>5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District's Obligations</p>
<p>The District's obligations under this Article are: (1) to notify any unit member who has failed to<br/>comply with the provisions of this section that, as a condition of employment in the District,<br/>such unit member must either become an Association member, pay a service fee, or establish an<br/>exempt status and make payment pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; and (2) deduct<br/>from pay appropriate amounts pursuant to Sections 5.2 and 5.4 herein. Under no circumstances<br/>shall the District be required to dismiss or otherwise discipline any unit member for failure to<br/>fulfill his/her obligations to pay the fees established herein.</p>
<p>5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold Harmless and Indemnity Provision</p>
<p>The Association, as defined by this Agreement, shall hold the District harmless and shall fully and<br/>promptly reimburse the District for reasonable legal fees and costs incurred in responding to or<br/>defending against any claims, disputes, or challenges, which are actually brought against the District or<br/>any of its agents by other than the Association in connection with the administration or enforcement of<br/>any section of this Agreement pertaining to representation fee.

For example, if the employee works the first half of the duty day at School<br/>Site A and the second half of the duty day at School Site B, then the employee will<br/>consider School Site B to be his or her &quot;home&quot; school.

<p>Prior to the 2006-07 school year, unit members who retire under the State Teachers Retirement<br/>System or PERS and are between the ages of 55 to 65 shall be eligible for a maximum monthly<br/>District contribution toward health insurance premiums of $415.00. The amount of $415.00<br/>shall be increased to the sum of $600.00 effective for any unit member who retired at the end of<br/>2006-2007 school year or thereafter. This retirement benefit is offered under the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees must have served at least fifteen (15) years in a certificated position with the<br/>District prior to retirement.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District premium contribution shall be paid for a period of five (5) consecutive years<br/>after retirement or until age 65, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District premium contribution must be applied toward either the District group<br/>medical insurance plan(s) provided to actively employed unit members or any other<br/>medical insurance plan of the retiree's choice. However, if the retiree chooses a plan<br/>other than a District plan, carrier regulations prohibit returning to the District plan(s).<br/>Regardless of which plan is selected by the retiree, the District will pay the full premium<br/>directly to the provider and the retiree will reimburse the District for any difference<br/>between the premium and $415.00 or $600.00 (whichever is applicable). If the insurance<br/>premium is less than $415.00 or $600.00, then the District contribution shall not exceed<br/>the actual premium cost. This section will apply to all present retirees under the<br/>conditions specified in Sections 7.1.1, 7.1.2 and 7.1.3, during the term of this agreement.</p>

<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated unit members serving in Alternative Education assignments are not<br/>required to serve extra duties, but alternative education unit members may<br/>complete extra duty assignments and earn EDTO time.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all extra duty assignments are of equal length, difficulty or exposure. For this<br/>reason, the Association site representative or AUHSDTA designee and the site<br/>administration shall determine the number of EDTO period equivalents to be<br/>allotted for school activities requiring supervision. The principal and site<br/>representative may seek assistance from the Director of Personnel and the<br/>association chief negotiator to determine how many EDTO period equivalents to<br/>allot for duties.

<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PAR Joint Panel has judged that a permanent teacher is performing<br/>on a 'satisfactory' level after one or two years of intervention, the principal<br/>must accept that judgment and implement the evaluation process for a<br/>minimum of one year before referring that teacher for intervention again.</p>
<p>15.2.2 This Program shall not deal with teacher employment issues which arise from<br/>accusations of neglect of duty or misconduct which are distinct and separate from<br/>teachers' evaluations in relationship to the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession covered by this negotiated agreement.</p>

<p>15.4 Consulting Teachers, Support Teachers, and Peer Coaches</p>
<p>15.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers will be selected by the Joint Panel Member Teachers. The selection<br/>will occur prior to March 1st for the following year. The Joint Panel Members will solicit<br/>applications from certificated staff (not including management). A certificated staff<br/>member must apply to be selected.</p>
<p>15.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting teachers will work in the Referred Participating Teacher Intervention Program,<br/>PAR Excellence, PAR Voluntary, and to serve as liaison to BTSA. Consulting teachers shall<br/>be compensated according to the stipulations as designated in Appendix D.</p>
<p>15.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of eligible evaluatees shall determine the number of consulting teachers<br/>and peer coaches needed.</p>
<p>15.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting teachers shall serve a three-year term. In the year 2000-2001, the consulting<br/>teacher at West Valley High School will serve a three (3) year term, while the consulting<br/>teacher at Anderson Union High School will serve a two (2) year term with the possibility<br/>to renew for an additional two (2) year term. All terms beyond this original configuration<br/>will be 3 years in length.</p>
<p>15.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All such terms are subject to annual evaluation by the Joint Panel. The documentation of<br/>such evaluation shall not be made a part of the consulting teacher's personnel file except<br/>upon the express written request of the individual consulting teacher. The Joint Panel has<br/>the right to replace a Consulting Teacher at the end of any year if the Joint Panel is not<br/>satisfied with the individual's performance.</p>
<p>15.4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional workdays scheduled beyond the 185-day certificated work year will be<br/>compensated hourly as follows: Consulting Teacher 1-2 years - $45 per hour; 3-4 years -<br/>$50 per hour; 5-6 years - $55 per hour; 7-8 years - $60 per hour (maximum).</p>
<p>15.4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of their service, consulting teachers, if they have left their teaching<br/>positions, shall have the right to return to a position for which the individual is qualified<br/>at their school of origination. If there is no open position, a position will be created by<br/>an involuntary transfer of the least senior teacher.</p>
<p>15.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Coaches will be selected by the Consulting Teachers. Certificated staff must apply<br/>for a Peer Coach position. The Consulting Teachers will form a &quot;pool&quot; of applicants from<br/>which they may assign Peer Coaches' duties.</p>
<p>15.4.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peer coach shall have the responsibility of serving as the liaison to the consulting<br/>teacher for the training, supporting and assisting of all teachers in the program. The<br/>consulting teacher shall communicate with the evaluating administrator regarding this<br/>process during the year.</p>
<p>15.4.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer coaches may be assigned a subset of second year probationary teachers designated</p>

<p>28</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>as &quot;at risk&quot;, i.e. teachers who have been recommended by the evaluating principal due to<br/>receiving &quot;needs improvement&quot; or &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in any of the standards. The principal<br/>would be the evaluator for all second year probationary teachers.</p>
<p>15.4.15 Peer coaches will receive release time during the school day and pay at the summer<br/>school rate for extra time as determined by the consulting teacher.</p>
<p>15.5 Permanent Teacher Intervention Program (P TIP)</p>
<p>15.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime focus of this Program is to provide assistance to the development and<br/>maintenance of high quality teaching.</p>
<p>15.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Program is to assist and offer remediation to referred participating<br/>permanent teachers whose performance has been evaluated as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in two<br/>out six California Standards for the Teaching Profession by the evaluating principal. The<br/>goal of the Program will be to assist referred participating permanent teachers to<br/>achieve a &quot;satisfactory&quot; level of performance consistent with the Standards. In<br/>addition, it shall be the obligation of the Joint Panel to report the results of this<br/>intervention to the Board of Trustees. The written documentation in the evaluation<br/>report shall become a part of the referred participating permanent teacher's personnel<br/>file.</p>
<p>15.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance and remedial efforts and activities shall be individualized and multifaceted<br/>and shall be preceded by a conference in the spring of the year when the teacher<br/>receives the &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; evaluation. The conference shall involve the teacher being<br/>referred, the evaluator who evaluated the teacher, and the consulting teacher to begin<br/>the development of a Permanent Teacher Intervention Program (P TIP) Plan. If the<br/>permanent teacher so desires, AUHSDTA shall provide representation in this meeting.</p>
<p>15.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of assistance, the referred participating permanent teacher's P TIP<br/>Plan shall be the joint responsibility of the consulting teacher and the Joint Panel. The<br/>P TIP Plan shall be based on the referred participating permanent teacher's adherence<br/>to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>15.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistance shall be provided by the consulting teachers under this article and shall<br/>be closely monitored by the Joint Panel.</p>
<p>15.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consulting teacher as well as the Joint Panel will communicate and consult with the<br/>evaluating principal on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>15.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this article precludes the principal or District from doing formal and<br/>informal observations nor from notifying the teacher verbally and/or in writing<br/>regarding incidents or events related to the teacher's fulfillment of his/her professional<br/>obligations. Should the principal deem it necessary to communicate with a teacher in<br/>this intervention program in a manner that relates to progressive discipline, i.e. letter of<br/>warning, reprimand, etc., the evaluating principal will provide a copy to the Consulting</p>
<p>CTA Agreement</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>Teacher if it relates to the P TIP Plan. See 15.2.2.</p>
<p>15.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consulting teacher will share all written and verbal progress reports during a<br/>conference with the teacher at least once every six weeks. A copy of the written<br/>reports will be provided to the evaluating principal and the Joint Panel.</p>
<p>15.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reports are made to the Joint Panel by the consulting teachers who will provide an<br/>oral report and all written documentation to the Joint Panel regarding the progress of<br/>the referred participating permanent teachers assigned to the P TIP.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and principal may be present for the consulting teacher presentation<br/>and will be given an opportunity to respond to the report.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, none of these individuals in Section 15.5.9(1) may be present during<br/>deliberations of the Joint Panel which are confidential. The Joint Panel may<br/>request additional follow-up information from any of these individuals.</p>
<p>15.5.10The course of assistance shall include one or more of the following:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple classroom observations by the consulting teacher;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance specific to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession which<br/>has been evaluated to be &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; or other areas deemed in need of<br/>assistance by the consulting teacher during the period of assistance.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for the teacher receiving assistance to observe exemplary practice<br/>either by the consulting teacher, peer coach or other exemplary teacher;</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District provided professional development opportunities;</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference attendance, often in the company of the consulting teacher or<br/>designee to facilitate reflection on how this experience fits into the PTIP Plan;</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of assistance which the consulting teacher and the Joint Panel may<br/>provide; and</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of every possible subject matter competency that may not be<br/>available within the consulting teacher. Therefore, at times when it is necessary<br/>to secure additional assistance to fully address the P TIP Plan, the consulting<br/>teacher may enlist the support of other staff members or expertise outside our<br/>school system. In all such cases, the consulting teacher shall maintain prime<br/>responsibility for the management of the P TIP Plan.</p>
<p>15.5.11 The Joint Panel will make an annual report to the Governing Board and the Association<br/>regarding the Program's impact, improvements to be made in the Program, and any<br/>recommendations regarding Program participants, including forwarding the names of</p>
<p>CTA Agreement</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>the referred participating permanent teachers with unsatisfactory evaluations who, after<br/>sustained evaluations, are unable to demonstrate &quot;satisfactory&quot; improvement. At the<br/>conclusion of the year of remediation, the Joint Panel shall report to the referred<br/>participating permanent teacher, the principal, and the Board of Education of the School<br/>District that:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the referred participating permanent teacher is:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now &quot;satisfactory&quot; in all California Standards for the Teaching Profession,<br/>and the principal shall evaluate the unit member the next year, or</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue with the assistance of the consulting teacher until he or she<br/>concludes that the teaching performance of the referred participating<br/>permanent teacher is &quot;satisfactory&quot; or</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; and further efforts of assistance would no longer be<br/>productive.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the consulting teacher's report shall be submitted to and discussed<br/>with the referred participating permanent teacher in order to receive his or her<br/>input and signature before it is submitted to the Joint Panel Committee. The<br/>Participating Teacher's signing of the report does not necessarily mean<br/>agreement, but rather that he or she has received a copy of the report.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before April 1 of each year, the consulting teacher shall complete a written report<br/>summarizing the teacher's participation in the Program consisting solely of: (1) a<br/>description of the assistance provided to the referred participating permanent<br/>teacher; and (2) a description of the degree to which the participant has complied<br/>with the P TIP Plan.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referred participating permanent teacher shall have the right to submit a<br/>written response, within twenty (20) calendar days, and have it attached to the<br/>final report. The referred participating permanent teacher shall also have the<br/>right to request a meeting with the Joint Panel, and to be represented at this<br/>meeting by an Association representative of his or her choice.</p>
<p>15.5.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding Section 15.5.11 above, and while the term of this assistance shall<br/>normally be for one school year, the intervention may be extended to a second year if<br/>the Joint Panel believes progress is being made although the referred participating<br/>permanent teacher may not have returned to a &quot;satisfactory&quot; level of performance.</p>
<p>15.5.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberations of the Joint Panel regarding participating teachers shall be closed and<br/>confidential; their recommendations shall be based on the information provided by the<br/>consulting teacher, the evaluating principal, the referred participating permanent<br/>teacher and AUHSDTA representation.</p>
<p>CTA Agreement</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>15.5.14 Within five (5) working days, the recommendation of the Joint Panel shall be reported<br/>to the referred participating permanent teacher, the consulting teacher, evaluating<br/>principal, a district office certificated administrator and representation by the AUHSTA<br/>if representation has been present at prior meetings. The Joint Panel will notify the<br/>representation of AUHSTA if requested by the referred participating permanent<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referred Participating Permanent Teacher Due Process Rights</p>
<p>15.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referred participating permanent teacher shall be entitled to review all reports<br/>generated by the consulting teacher prior to their submission to the Joint Panel and to<br/>have affixed thereto his/her comments. To effectuate this right, the consulting teacher<br/>shall provide the referred participating permanent teacher being reviewed with copies<br/>of such reports at least five (5) working days prior to any such meeting.</p>
<p>15.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referred participating permanent teacher shall have a right to be represented by<br/>AUHSDTA in any meetings of the Joint Panel to which they are called and shall be<br/>given a reasonable opportunity to present his/her point of view concerning any report<br/>being made.</p>
<p>15.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to refer a referred participating permanent teacher for intervention<br/>through this Program shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>15.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referred participating permanent teacher shall have the right to timely reports of<br/>progress being made.</p>
<p>15.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referred participating permanent teacher shall have the right to present reasons<br/>for consideration as to why a specific consulting teacher should be replaced and<br/>another consulting teacher or peer coach be assigned to that teacher.</p>
<p>15.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All records of the intervention program will be sealed after four years of subsequent<br/>successful professional practice during which time the teacher has received a minimum<br/>evaluation of &quot;satisfactory&quot;. If during this four-year period, an &quot;unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation&quot; occurs, the records of the intervention will continue to remain open until a<br/>period of four consecutive years of successful evaluations has taken place.</p>
<p>15.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Program in no manner diminishes the legal rights of bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>15.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>15.7.1 A referred participating permanent teacher shall not have access to the grievance<br/>process to challenge the contents of reports, evaluation, or decisions of the Joint Panel<br/>but may file responses which shall be attached to the intervention documentation and<br/>become part of the official record of the intervention.

<p>15.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures for the Program shall not exceed revenues received from funds made<br/>available through passage of AB1X (1999, Villaraigosa or successor legislation) excluding<br/>the allowable administrative cost. The PAR program budget will be evaluated annually<br/>when funding for the program is known.</p>
<p>15.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of each fiscal year, if revenue for the PAR Program exceeds<br/>expenditures, the Joint Panel shall meet to determine the allocation of the surplus.</p>
<p>15.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consulting teachers and peer coaches shall be allocated funds to provide for release<br/>days and/or conferences as developmental tools with the teachers assigned to the<br/>Program.</p>
<p>15.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that this Program shall terminate if for any reason there<br/>exists an inability for full funding of this Program thereof through AB1X (1999,<br/>Villaraigosa) or successor legislation.</p>

<p>15.7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall modify or in any manner affect the rights of the Governing<br/>Board/District under provisions of the Education Code relating to the employment,<br/>classification, retention or non-reelection of certificated employees.

<p>ARTICLE 16: GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION</p>
<p>16.1 Definitions</p>
<p>16.1.1 A &quot;grievance&quot; is an allegation by a grievant that there has been a violation of an express</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>provision(s) of this Agreement.</p>
<p>16.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; is a member(s) of the bargaining unit who files a grievance or it may be the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>16.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is a day when the District Office is open for business, and the unit member is<br/>required to be at work, excluding Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>16.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;representative&quot; is an Association appointed representative, Association staff, or<br/>Association legal counsel who participates in the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>16.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Association&quot; shall mean the local employee organization recognized by the Board of<br/>Trustees as the exclusive representative for the unit of employees covered by this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>16.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Immediate Supervisor&quot; is the site administrator or designee.</p>
<p>16.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;District Grievance Form&quot; shall mean a District provided form which shall be completed<br/>in writing. (Appendix A)</p>
<p>16.2 General Provisions</p>
<p>16.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most grievances arise from misunderstandings or disputes which can be settled<br/>promptly and satisfactorily on an informal basis at the immediate supervisory level. The<br/>District and Association representatives agree that every effort will be made by the<br/>District and the party filing the grievance to settle grievances at the lowest possible level.</p>
<p>16.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as<br/>may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>16.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any unit member<br/>having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with the immediate supervisor, and<br/>to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by the Association provided that the<br/>adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and that the Association<br/>has been given an opportunity to be present at such adjustment to state its views.<br/>Further, nothing contained in this grievance procedure shall be construed as limiting the<br/>right of a unit member at any time to present a written formal grievance to the District<br/>and have such grievance adjusted without the intervention of the Association, as long as<br/>the adjustment is consistent with the terms of the Agreement. The District shall not<br/>agree to a resolution of said grievance until the Association has been served by the<br/>District with a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has also been<br/>given the opportunity to file a response. A grievant who wants representation shall be<br/>represented by the designated representatives selected by the Association.</p>
<p>16.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant shall have the right to include in the grievance hearings such witnesses as<br/>they deem necessary to develop facts pertinent to the grievance. These names shall be</p>
<p>CTA Agreement</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>July 1, 2012-June 30, 2015</p>
<p>made available to both parties upon request. Such witnesses shall be in addition to the<br/>grievant's representative.</p>
<p>16.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits<br/>specified at each level should be considered to be maximums and every effort should be<br/>made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>16.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at all levels of the grievance procedure will be in writing, setting forth<br/>the decision and the reasons therefore and will be transmitted promptly to all parties in<br/>interest and to the President of the Association. Time limits for appeal provided in each<br/>level shall begin the day following receipt of written decisions by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>16.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance meetings will be scheduled by the District at mutually convenient times and<br/>places. Normally such meetings will be scheduled in such a manner that they will not<br/>conflict with regular duties, however, when such meetings are scheduled so as to conflict<br/>with the unit member's work hours, reasonable release time, without loss of salary, will<br/>be provided to the grievant and his/her authorized Association representative, if any. In<br/>addition, witnesses to an arbitration hearing shall be given release time while testifying.<br/>At Level I or Level II grievance meetings where it is necessary to include more than three</p>
<p>(3) unit members who have information about the grievance, conferences shall be held<br/>before or after school hours. In addition, witnesses to an arbitration hearing shall be<br/>given release time while testifying. This constitutes reasonable periods of release time<br/>within the meaning of Government Code Section 3543.1(c).</p>
<p>16.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither party shall take reprisals against any member of the unit, Association<br/>representative, management person, or any other participant in the grievance.</p>
<p>16.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All grievance records shall be maintained at the district office in a file separate and apart<br/>from other personnel records. The maintenance and disposition of those grievance files<br/>shall be governed by the provisions of Education Code 44031. The grievant shall have<br/>access to all grievance documents in such file. Documents relevant to processing a<br/>grievance shall be furnished upon request by either party.</p>
<p>16.2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grievance has been filed by a unit member, the grievant may terminate the<br/>grievance at any time by giving written notice to the District and the Association. This<br/>does not preclude the Association from continuing the grievance if the Association<br/>alleges the District has violated the Agreement.</p>
<p>16.2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances and other necessary documents are in Appendix A. Costs for<br/>preparing such forms will be absorbed by the District.</p>
<p>16.2.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances which arise as a result of a District action(s) or decision(s) that occur at a level<br/>higher than the immediate supervisor or designee may be filed at Level II.</p>
