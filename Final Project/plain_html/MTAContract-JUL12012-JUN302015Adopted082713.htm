The site<br/>administrator shall plan the adjusted day schedule in accordance<br/>with the process contained in Section 6.3.</p>
<p>School staff meetings to coordinate programs and procedures may<br/>be conducted. However, an effort should be made to avoid<br/>scheduling on a regular basis on “adjusted days” in order to<br/>preserve the need for this flexible time.</p>
<p>Elementary use of adjusted days will be allocated as follows: The<br/>first, third, and fifth Wednesdays will be utilized for teacher<br/>preparation. The second and fourth Wednesdays will be utilized for<br/>District use, including but not limited to: staff development and<br/>district grade level meetings. The scheduling of District use<br/>Wednesdays and teacher preparation Wednesdays may be switched<br/>by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>6.3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agree that time for individual preparation</p>
<p>and site collaboration is vital to the instructional<br/>program. Therefore, the District agrees to make<br/>reasonable efforts to schedule District Committee<br/>meetings on District use Wednesdays. When District use<br/>Wednesdays are not utilized, the parties agree that Site<br/>Administrators will make a reasonable effort to schedule<br/>school site meetings on those District use Wednesdays</p>
<p>Middle School adjusted Wednesday will be on Wednesday morning<br/>from 7:30-9:00 a.m. Students will arrive at 9:00 a.m. on<br/>Wednesdays. The ending time at the middle schools will be<br/>2:20 p.m.</p>
<p>The District shall indicate starting and ending times on all in-<br/>service notices. Every effort shall be made to adhere to these times.<br/>There shall be accommodations of personal needs when appropriate<br/>or necessary. In the event that a unit member needs to leave before<br/>the designated ending time s/he will notify the building principal.</p>

<p>6.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide four (4) shortened days each school year,<br/>two (2) of which shall be on Back-to-School Night and Open House<br/>Night. Should Back-to-School Night/Parent Orientation Night or<br/>Open House Night fall on an adjusted day (adjusted days are<br/>shorter days at an elementary school because other days have been<br/>lengthened), another day will be scheduled as a shortened day. No<br/>regularly scheduled meetings shall be scheduled on the afternoon of<br/>Back-to-School/Parent Orientation or Open House Night.</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use and time of the remaining shortened days shall be<br/>determined by the principal in consultation with the staff at a<br/>faculty meeting.</p>

<p>When the CSTP was adopted, the document included the<br/>following paragraphs and the parties agree that these<br/>paragraphs are included for establishing the importance<br/>of diversity among students and teachers.</p>
<p>“Professional educators in the State of California serve an<br/>increasingly diverse population of students. This<br/>diversity among students greatly enriches and enlivens<br/>the educational experience for teachers and students<br/>alike. Therefore, there is a critical need for teachers who<br/>are responsive to the varied socio-cultural, racial,<br/>religious, ethnic, linguistic and economic backgrounds of<br/>all students and who consider how learning differences<br/>and abilities, gender and gender identity family structure,<br/>sexual orientation, and other aspects of humankind<br/>influence learning and teaching.</p>
<p>-31-</p>
<p>MP #4843-2904-3714 v8</p>
<p>The California Standards for the Teaching Profession<br/>support the creation of classroom communities and<br/>curricula in which diverse students with varying<br/>backgrounds, learning styles, strengths, interests, needs,<br/>and abilities are engaged and challenged as learners. The<br/>use of the term “all students” throughout the standards<br/>reflects a commitment to the education of the full<br/>spectrum of students and the need for teachers to<br/>continually strengthen their understanding of students,<br/>families, and communities.</p>
<p>The Standards also value the diversity of teachers'<br/>backgrounds, perspectives, skills, knowledge, and<br/>practices. Teaching is not a profession in which a single<br/>approach to professional practice will be effective for all<br/>practitioners in all contexts. Although the Standards<br/>articulate a common vision of excellence in teaching,<br/>different teachers have different ways of enacting the<br/>Standards effectively. By respecting the diverse ways in<br/>which teachers pursue excellence in professional practice,<br/>schools enrich and enhance the education of all students.”</p>
<p>11.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publishers’ Norms</p>
<p>Evaluations shall not include the use of publishers’ norms<br/>established by standardized tests.</p>
<p>11.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Instructional Unit Members</p>
<p>Each non-instructional unit member shall be evaluated based upon<br/>the unit member’s satisfactory performance of defined job<br/>responsibihties. Each non-instructional unit member shall meet<br/>the standards stated in Education Code Section 44662, the<br/>applicable California Standards For The Teaching Profession,<br/>Section 11.5.1 and the satisfactory performance of the duties shown<br/>in the relevant job description. The timelines shown on Appendix<br/>D-6 shall apply to non-instructional unit member evaluations.</p>
<p>11.6 Formal Evaluation Schedule/Timelines</p>
<p>11.6.1 Every unit member who will be formally evaluated during the<br/>school year shall be notified in writing no later than September 10.</p>
<p>MP #4843-2904-3714 v8</p>
<p>-32-</p>
<p>11.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary evaluator shall schedule a meeting with unit members<br/>scheduled for an evaluation no later than October 15. At this<br/>meeting the evaluator shall:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review the contents of the observation and evaluation forms;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discuss the data to be collected by the unit member and the<br/>evaluator for use in the evaluation;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discuss any areas of emphasis for growth; and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;schedule the next evaluation conference(s) and/or classroom<br/>observation(s).</p>
<p>The primary evaluator and the unit member shall make a good<br/>faith effort to reach agreement on these matters. In the event the<br/>primary evaluator and the unit member cannot reach agreement,<br/>the primary evaluator shall be responsible for making the final<br/>determination.</p>
<p>11.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary evaluator shall provide probationary and temporary<br/>unit members with the completed Final Evaluation Form on or<br/>before February 28 of the school year. The primary evaluator shall<br/>provide permanent unit members with the completed Final<br/>Evaluation Form on or before May 10 of the school year.</p>
<p>11.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association encourage the evaluatee to submit<br/>in writing to the primary evaluator a description of any substantial<br/>challenges or significant changes in the unit member’s assignment<br/>that occur during the school year (e.g., a significant change in class<br/>composition). The evaluatee and the primary evaluator shall<br/>objectively describe the problem (challenge or changes), the primary<br/>evaluator shall recommend strategies for increasing the probability<br/>of success, and the evaluatee shall implement the recommended<br/>strategies.</p>
<p>11.7 Classroom Observations</p>
<p>11.7.1 Because the evaluation process is to be continuous in nature, the<br/>evaluation shall consist of data collection, workplace observation,<br/>and classroom observation consistent with Section 11.5. Formal<br/>classroom observations shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>11.7.1.1 Permanent Formal Observation</p>
<p>Every permanent unit member being evaluated shall have<br/>at least two formal scheduled classroom observations.</p>
<p>MP #4843-2904-3714 v8</p>
<p>-33-</p>
<p>The first formal observation shall be scheduled no later<br/>than December 15 and the second formal observation<br/>shall be scheduled no later than April 15.</p>
<p>11.7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary Or Probationary Formal Observation</p>
<p>Every temporary or probationary unit member being<br/>evaluated shall have at least two formal scheduled<br/>classroom observations. The first formal observation<br/>shall be scheduled no later than November 1 and the<br/>second formal observation shall be scheduled no later<br/>than February 1.</p>

<p>For a formal classroom observation the primary evaluator<br/>will remain in the classroom for at least 30 minutes,<br/>substantially the entire lesson, or the entire period.</p>
<p>11.7.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Observation Conference</p>
<p>Prior to each formal observation, the primary evaluator<br/>shall schedule a pre-observation conference with the<br/>probationary or temporary unit members being evaluated.<br/>Although the primary evaluator is not required to<br/>schedule a pre-observation conference prior to formally<br/>observing a permanent unit member, a pre-observation<br/>conference shall be held at the request of either the<br/>primary evaluator or the unit member. At the pre¬<br/>observation conference, the primary evaluator and the<br/>unit member shall review and discuss the Observation<br/>Form. The Observation Form is attached as Appendix<br/>D-l and is incorporated into this section.</p>
<p>If the primary evaluator requests a copy of the lesson<br/>plan, the unit member shall provide a copy of the lesson<br/>plan at the pre-observation conference.</p>
<p>11.7.1.5 Post-Observation Conference</p>
<p>Each scheduled classroom observation shall be followed<br/>by a post-observation conference within five (5) working<br/>days following the observation, unless the conference date<br/>is extended by mutual agreement. If the primary<br/>evaluator requests a copy of the lesson plan, the unit<br/>member shall bring the lesson plan to the post<br/>observation conference. The primary evaluator’s request</p>
<p>MP #4843-2904-3714 v8</p>
<p>for lesson plans must be made at least two (2) working<br/>days and no more than ten (10) working days in advance<br/>of the observation. The primary evaluator shall prepare a<br/>summary of the observations by completing an<br/>Observation Form (Appendix D-l), which will be shown to<br/>and discussed with the unit member at this conference. If<br/>the primary evaluator has any concerns about the unit<br/>member’s performance in any of the areas, the primary<br/>evaluator shall discuss those concerns with the unit<br/>member at this post-observation conference. If a<br/>permanent unit member is given an “Improvement<br/>Needed” or “Unsatisfactory” rating in any category, the<br/>primary evaluator shall, on the Observation Form<br/>(Appendix D-l): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;areas of unsatisfactory</p>
<p>performance, describe the improvement needed to meet<br/>District standards, and set a reasonable time period<br/>within which the unit member is expected to demonstrate<br/>improvement.</p>
<p>The unit member is responsible for improving his or her<br/>performance and demonstrating the indicators of<br/>accomplishment. Merely completing improvement<br/>activities may not demonstrate successful performance or<br/>the indicators of accomplishment. The primary evaluator<br/>shall be responsible for documenting the unit member’s<br/>failure to meet standards and shall provide the unit<br/>member with a copy of the documentation.</p>
<p>11.7.1.6 Informal Unscheduled Observations</p>
<p>Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the primary<br/>evaluator from making informal, unscheduled classroom<br/>observations in addition to the scheduled observations. If<br/>the primary evaluator is concerned about the unit<br/>member’s performance during an unscheduled<br/>observation, the primary evaluator shall discuss those<br/>concerns with the unit member during a conference held<br/>within five (5) working days unless extended by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>11.8 Final Evaluation</p>
<p>11.8.1 Final Evaluation Form</p>

No later than May 10, the<br/>primary evaluator shall complete and provide each permanent unit<br/>member being evaluated with a completed Final Evaluation Form.<br/>The Final Evaluation Form is attached as Appendix D-2 and is<br/>incorporated into this section. Each completed Observation Form<br/>and any unit member comments to the Observation Form shall be<br/>attached to the Final Evaluation Form. At the time the Final<br/>Evaluation Form is given to the unit member or as soon thereafter<br/>as possible, the primary evaluator and the unit member shall have<br/>a conference to discuss the ratings and comments included in the<br/>Final Evaluation Form. Within ten (10) working days, the unit<br/>member shall have the right to attach written comments to the<br/>Final Evaluation. The Final Evaluation Form and all the<br/>attachments, including Observation Forms and the unit member’s<br/>comments, shall be placed in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>11.8.2 Unit Member’s Signature On Observation Form Or Final<br/>Evaluation Form</p>
<p>The unit member’s signature on the Observation Form or Final<br/>Evaluation Form demonstrates that the unit member has received<br/>the Final Evaluation Form and does not demonstrate that the unit<br/>member agrees with the primary evaluator’s ratings or comments<br/>on the Observation Form or the Final Evaluation Form. If the unit<br/>member wishes to respond to the Final Evaluation Form or any<br/>document attached to that form, the unit member shall submit the<br/>response to the District within ten (10) work days. The District<br/>shall add the unit member response to the Final Evaluation Form<br/>and shall file it in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>11.8.3 Referral To The Peer Assistance And Review Program</p>

Should the class size be exceeded<br/>after the twentieth (20th) day the affected unit member shall be<br/>provided one dollar ($1) per class period per day for each student in<br/>excess of the maximum class size. For the purpose of this<br/>calculation, mainstreamed students shall be counted toward<br/>entitlement to an overage payment. These funds shall be paid to<br/>the unit member at the end of each semester.</p>
<p>Nothing in this article shall abrogate the right of the unit<br/>member(s) and immediate supervisor to arrive at a mutually<br/>agreeable class size arrangement. The number of work stations<br/>available, safety issues, and student appliances/equipment shall be<br/>considered in modifications to class size.</p>
<p>The presence of students with IEPs, 504s, individualized health<br/>care plans and EL students in a regular classroom shall be<br/>recognized by the building administrator in balancing teaching<br/>loads.</p>
<p>When a student with an IEP, 504, or individualized health care<br/>plan is placed in a regular classroom, the principal or his/her<br/>designee shall consult with the affected unit member. Other<br/>District personnel shall be included in the consultation if deemed<br/>appropriate. At that time they will develop a plan to support the<br/>unit member in meeting the needs of the student.</p>
<p>Core Classes</p>
<p>In middle school, the same teacher(s) and same students<br/>participating in a multi-subject block of time dedicated to a</p>
<p>MP #4843-2904-3714 v8</p>
<p>-69-</p>
<p>combination of core subjects (language arts, history/social science,<br/>science, and math). These classes are intended to be formed on the<br/>basis of core subject correlation, not on the basis of meeting class<br/>size constraints.</p>
<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculation Of Class Size Overage Payments For All Grades</p>
<p>A teacher who desires to claim overage payments pursuant to Sections 14.1.7<br/>or 14.2.5 shall notify the site administrator of the overage using a form<br/>provided by the District. Upon receipt of the form, the District shall<br/>determine the total number of classes that have exceeded the maximums<br/>established by this Article, and the overage payment due to the teacher. The<br/>District shall provide a copy of the report determining the overages and<br/>payments due, and the teacher shall sign the report certifying its accuracy, or<br/>identify any errors on the report. The District shall pay the teacher for<br/>overages at the end of each semester.</p>
<p>14.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialists And Non-Classroom Teaching Assignments</p>
<p>14.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Traveling Specialist/Prep Provider teacher shall be assigned to<br/>cover only the class of the teacher for whom the prep period is being<br/>provided, except music when the Traveling Specialist/Prep Period<br/>Teacher is teaching chorus (vocal music), in which case, two (2)<br/>classes may be combined.</p>
<p>14.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present maximum ratios for specialists shall be maintained during<br/>the term of this Agreement.</p>

<p>15.9 PAR Duration And Conclusion</p>
<p>15.9.1 PAR is intended to be a one (1) year support system. If a<br/>permanent unit member who has been referred due to<br/>“UNSATISFACTORY’ as outlined in Section 15.5.2, mandatory<br/>participation, is found to be satisfactory at the end of the year, the<br/>PAR intervention is deemed to be successfully concluded.</p>

<p>15.9.2</p>
<p>15.9.3</p>
<p>If the mandatory PT is still in need of improvement after the year<br/>of PAR support, the responsibility for further interventions and/or<br/>actions reverts wholly to the principal as primary evaluator.</p>
<p>Unit members who perform functions as consulting teachers or<br/>panel members under this document shall have the same protection<br/>from liability and access to appropriate defense as other public<br/>school employees pursuant to division 3.6 (commencing with<br/>Section 810) of Title I of California Government Code.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 16: VARIANCE PLANS</p>
<p>16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>It is the objective of the Association and the District to encourage initiative<br/>and innovation at the work site through site based decision-making. To<br/>promote and achieve this objective, the parties recognize that proposals may<br/>be generated which may not follow the provisions of the Agreement. In the<br/>event of such a disagreement, a variance may be warranted. The following<br/>variance process is intended to provide the necessary flexibility for site based<br/>decision-making and at the same time protect the integrity of the negotiated<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variance Procedures</p>
<p>In the event a faculty member or portion of the faculty (including the site<br/>administrator) at a school site wishes to develop an instructional program or<br/>schedule that varies from the negotiated Collective Bargaining Agreement,<br/>they must complete the following steps:</p>
<p>16.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An open discussion of the proposed plan shall take place involving<br/>all unit members at that site and the site administrator.</p>
<p>16.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faculty at the site shall decide by consensus what that program<br/>or schedule will be.</p>
<p>Consensus means:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants contribute resources. Encourage use of one<br/>another’s resources and opinions. View differences as helpful<br/>rather than as a hindrance.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone can paraphrase the issue.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a chance to describe his or her feelings about the<br/>issue.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who continue to disagree indicate publicly that they are<br/>willing to go along for an experimental try for a prescribed<br/>period of time.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All share in the final decision.</p>
<p>16.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event consensus cannot be achieved, a secret ballot vote shall<br/>be conducted by an Association representative or an Association<br/>designee at the site. The variance plan must receive the support of</p>
<p>MP #4843-2904-3714 v8</p>
<p>-78-</p>
<p>at least 75% of the unit members assigned to the site. Ballots will<br/>be counted after all votes have been cast.</p>
<p>16.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faculty’s written proposal will identify those provisions of the<br/>Agreement which may be affected by the variance plan, as well as<br/>proposed dates of implementation and expected duration.<br/>Following approval by consensus or a 75% vote, this proposal shall<br/>be submitted to the MTA President and the District Superintendent<br/>for review.</p>
<p>16.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association President will present the variance plan to the<br/>Association Representative Council for approval and the District<br/>Superintendent will present the plan to the Board of Education.</p>
<p>16.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon review of the variance plan by both parties as provided above,<br/>the plan will be implemented according to its provisions.</p>
<p>16.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the proposal is not passed by either or both parties, the<br/>faculty at the participating school may amend and resubmit the<br/>proposal following the procedure in Section 16.2 above.</p>
<p>16.3 Renewal. Amendment Or Rescission Of The Plan</p>
<p>A variance plan may be renewed or amended by following the procedures in</p>
<p>Section 16.2 above. It may be rescinded by consensus or a 75% vote of the</p>
<p>petitioning faculty and notification to the MTA President and the District</p>

<p>APPENDIX F: COMMUNITY RELATIONS COMPLAINTS CONCERNING</p>
<p>SCHOOL PERSONNEL</p>
<p>It is believed that direct communication offers the best opportunity to clarify<br/>misunderstandings or communicate concerns. Hence, a parent or citizen with a<br/>complaint regarding a certificated employee should be encouraged to discuss the<br/>complaint directly with the employee involved on an informal basis. If the parent or<br/>citizen is either not satisfied after meeting with the employee or feels strongly about<br/>not meeting directly with the employee involved, the following procedure shall be<br/>used:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent or citizen should contact the employee’s immediate supervisor to<br/>outline the concern or complaint. The supervisor shall then inform the<br/>employee as soon as possible, but within five working days, regarding the<br/>allegations or concerns in an effort to resolve the issue at this level, if<br/>possible.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant, the<br/>complainant shall be provided the district form to outline the concerns in<br/>writing. The written concerns shall be submitted to the employee’s<br/>immediate supervisor. The employee shall be given the opportunity to review<br/>the written concerns and to prepare a written response. Both the written<br/>concerns and the employee’s response, if one is prepared, shall be forwarded<br/>to the Superintendent (or designee) within five working days. In the absence<br/>of a written complaint at this level, the district will not pursue further action.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent should be informed immediately of any charge that<br/>might have implications for the physical welfare of students or other<br/>personnel. If the Superintendent feels the welfare of students or personnel is<br/>in jeopardy, a temporary reassignment may be made until the matter is<br/>resolved. At the time of reassignment the teacher shall be informed of the<br/>reason for reassignment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent (or designee) shall conduct any investigation deemed<br/>necessary and shall meet with the employee and/or the employee’s immediate<br/>supervisor and the complainant within ten working days. The<br/>Superintendent may take steps to resolve the complaint at this level or may<br/>refer the complaint on to the Board of Trustees for a personnel hearing.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complainant shall have the right of appeal to the Board of Trustees if the<br/>matter has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant, in which<br/>case the Board shall consider the appeal in Executive Session (G.C. 54957).</p>
<p>If a complaint is filed directly with the Board of Trustees, no direct action will<br/>be taken until it has been determined that steps 1, 2, and 3 have been followed.</p>
