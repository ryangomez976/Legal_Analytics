<p>Section 1 — Leaves of Absence — General Provisions</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are required to apply in writing for all leaves of absence except sick leave and<br/>leaves for which prior approval is prohibited by law. Except in emergencies, leave of<br/>absence may not commence prior to written approval.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided by statute or by express provision of district policy, the district retains<br/>the right to withhold approval of any leave requested.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district at any time may require adequate confirmation of stated reasons for leave,<br/>and any false statement made to support a request for leave shall be grounds for<br/>withholding leave and for such other disciplinary action as the district deems appropriate.<br/>A teacher on paid leave of absence shall not be gainfully employed by any employer<br/>except as approved by the district.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where applicable, following any leave, a doctor’s statement attesting to the teacher’s<br/>fitness to resume employment may be required before the teacher returns to work. The<br/>district may require confirmation by a doctor of the district’s choice and expense before a<br/>teacher is eligible to return to work.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who fails to return to work at the expiration of approved leave shall be deemed<br/>to be absent without leave.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district will provide for employee absences as authorized by law and as negotiated<br/>between the district and the employee organization.</p>
<p>Section 2— Sick Leave</p>
<p>Full-time employees will receive one day of sick leave for every month worked. Teachers and</p>
<p>other ten-month employees will receive 10 days sick leave per year.</p>
<p>A. An employee employed less than full-time shall be entitled to that proportion of sick<br/>leave as the number of hours the employee is employed per month bears to those<br/>employed full-time.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay for any day of such sick leave absence shall be the same as the pay which would<br/>have been received had the employees served during the day. Credit for sick leave need<br/>not be accrued prior to taking the sick leave by the employee and a sick leave absence<br/>may be taken at any time during the year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee does not take the full amount of sick leave allowed in any year under this<br/>section, the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning to work from sick leave involving three (3) or more consecutive<br/>days or multiple sick leaves of any duration involving the same or related illness or<br/>condition, may be required to provide a physician’s release verifying the unit member’s<br/>illness and the unit member’s fitness to return to service, before the unit member can<br/>return to duty. If such an absence or absences occur at the end of a school year, such<br/>verification may be required before the unit member may return to duty the next school<br/>year. If an employee is required to provide a physician’s release pursuant to this Article,<br/>the district shall reimburse the employee for the out-of-pocket costs of obtaining the<br/>physician’s release which are not otherwise reimbursed or compensated under the<br/>employee’s applicable medical insurance coverage. No additional sick leave shall be<br/>charged to the employee who is absent from work for the sole purpose of obtaining a<br/>physician’s release.</p>
<p>Section 3 — Use of Sick Leave for Pregnancy</p>
<p>An employee shall be entitled to utilize sick leave for pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and the</p>
<p>recovery.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave shall not be used for child care, child rearing, or preparation for child rearing, but<br/>shall be limited to the causes set forth above.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the leave, including the date on which the leave shall commence and the<br/>date on which the employee shall resume duties shall be determined by the employee’s<br/>medical specialist. The employee shall be entitled to return to a position comparable to<br/>that held at the time the leave commenced.</p>
<p>Section 4— Transfer of Sick Leave</p>
<p>The district hereby adopts the provisions of Education Code section 44979 which provides for</p>
<p>the transfer of accumulated sick leave from an employee’s previous school district in the manner</p>
<p>prescribed when the employee is initially employed by the district.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Section 5 — Extended Illness Leave</p>
<p>When a unit member has been absent due to illness or injury and has exhausted all available sick<br/>leave, and continues to be absent due to illness or injury, the employee may utilize extended<br/>illness leave for an additional period not to exceed five (5) months. During this five-month<br/>period, the district may subtract from the salary due to the unit member the amount actually paid<br/>to a substitute employed to fill the position during the absence or, if no substitute is employed,<br/>the amount that would have been paid to a substitute had one been employed. If no substitute is<br/>hired, the deduction shall be the regular daily substitute rate. If the extended illness leave<br/>continues past twenty days and no substitute is hired, the deduction shall be the long term<br/>substitute rate thereafter, until such leave is exhausted. During the extended illness leave period,<br/>the unit member shall receive not less than half of his/her normal daily pay. A unit member shall<br/>not be provided more than one (1) five-month extended illness leave period per illness or injury.<br/>However, if a school year terminates prior to the exhaustion of the five-month period, the unit<br/>member may take the balance of the five-month period in the subsequent school year for the<br/>same illness or injury. Upon return from extended illness leave, a unit member must provide a<br/>physician's release verifying the unit member’s illness and the unit member’s fitness to return to<br/>service, before the unit member can return to duty.</p>
<p>Upon the exhaustion of the extended illness leave, if the unit member is unable to return to duty,<br/>the unit member shall be placed on unpaid leave of absence pending further disposition subject<br/>to any rights applicable under the state and federal family medical leave acts.</p>
<p>Section 6 — Use of Sick Leave for Personal Necessity</p>
<p>The district hereby adopts the provisions of Education Code section 44981 which allows for the<br/>use of up to seven of the ten days of sick leave granted per year in cases of personal necessity.<br/>Days used for personal necessity shall be deducted from the employee’s accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>A. Personal necessity leave is available for a matter of compelling personal importance, or<br/>an emergency situation, that is unavoidable and of a serious nature involving<br/>circumstances which the employee cannot be expected to disregard and which may not<br/>be conducted at a time other than during the employee’s regular duty hours, including but<br/>not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or illness of a member of the employee’s immediate family as defined in this<br/>Article.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons at the discretion of the superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity leave may not be taken to extend a school holiday, vacation, or recess<br/>period or for any recreational purpose.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the circumstances set forth in this section, the employee shall make a request<br/>for personal necessity leave in advance of the time that the leave is to be utilized.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use days designated as “personal necessity” leave days for purpose of<br/>tending to “personal business” or “emergencies.” “personal business” or “emergency”<br/>leave may be used for any of the circumstances listed in subsection A above, or for any<br/>other legal or business purpose which is unavoidable and is of an important and serious<br/>nature involving circumstances which the unit member cannot be expected to disregard<br/>and which may only be conducted during school hours. In order to utilize the “personal<br/>business” or “emergency” leave day, a unit member must submit an application and<br/>verification of the need for the leave which shall consist of a written statement signed by<br/>the employee attesting that the requested day of leave will or has been used for one of the<br/>circumstances listed in subsection A above, or for another legal or business purpose<br/>which is unavoidable and is of an important and serious nature involving circumstances<br/>which the unit member cannot be expected to disregard and which may only be<br/>conducted during school hours. The unit member need not disclose any further<br/>information on the application. Wherever possible, a unit member shall request this leave<br/>in advance of the time the leave shall be utilized. Abuse or falsification of this request as<br/>to purpose or use shall subject the unit member to discipline, including dismissal.</p>

<p>The district hereby adopts the requirements set forth in Education Code section 44984 for<br/>certificated employees.</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary action shall be for just cause and shall be administered in accordance with<br/>the provisions of this article. Disciplinary actions taken pursuant to the provisions and<br/>procedures of this article are intended to be corrective rather than punitive.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of severity of the disciplinary action should be reasonably related to the<br/>nature of the offense committed by the employee and should take into account any prior<br/>disciplinary action or actions imposed on the employee. When the district determines it<br/>to be appropriate, disciplinary action imposed pursuant to the provisions of this article<br/>will be preceded by an oral and/or written warning. Oral and written warnings do not<br/>constitute disciplinary action and will not be placed in the personnel file,</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Discipline” shall mean a letter of warning, letter of reprimand or a suspension without<br/>pay of up to 15 work days when any of these actions is taken as a result of an offense<br/>committed by the employee.</p>

Also specifically excluded from the provisions and procedures of this article are<br/>actions taken by the district as part of the process of evaluation of an employee’s work<br/>performance or that are related to the placement of materials in the district’s personnel<br/>file pursuant to the provisions of article VII.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No disciplinary action shall be taken for any cause that arose prior to the employee<br/>becoming a permanent employee of the district or for any cause that arose more than two<br/>years preceding the date of the notice of disciplinary action unless the cause was<br/>concealed or not disclosed by the employee when it reasonably could be assumed that the<br/>employee should have disclosed the facts to the district.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice of disciplinary action shall inform the employee of the charges as well as the<br/>effective date of discipline, which shall be not less than six work days after service of the<br/>notice. The notice shall contain a statement in ordinary and concise language of the<br/>specific acts and omissions upon which the disciplinary action is based, a statement of<br/>the cause for the action taken, a listing of dates of related oral and/or written warnings, if<br/>any, and if it is claimed that an employee has violated a district rule or regulation, the<br/>rule or regulation shall be set forth in the notice.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice shall inform the employee of the right to appeal the disciplinary action and the<br/>time in which the appeal and request for a hearing must be filed, which shall be not less<br/>than five work days after service of the notice.

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice shall also contain a form, the signing and filing of which shall constitute the<br/>appeal and request for a hearing.

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the board shall be final.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained within this procedure shall be interpreted to deny an<br/>employee’s right to seek judicial review of a disciplinary action following the<br/>completion of the procedures contained in section 4, paragraphs A through A.6,<br/>of this article.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is represented by the exclusive representative, the appeal shall be heard<br/>by a conciliator (or arbitrator), at the request of the exclusive representative.

<p>following shall apply:</p>
<p>1. Placement on the first step of the appropriate column on the salary schedule, as<br/>set forth in paragraph A of this Appendix, is based on the possession of an<br/>appropriate credential and/or completion of a Bachelor’s Degree from an<br/>accredited college or university with no additional approved units and with no<br/>creditable years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>a. Satisfactory completion of each unit of college credit with a grade of ”C” or<br/>better is required for initial placement beyond Column A. “Pass” or “credit” is<br/>acceptable when letter grades are unavailable.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>2. A maximum of six years of previous teaching experience shall be granted for<br/>teachers entering the district for the first time.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of 75% of the teaching days of the year must be completed<br/>for one year’s credit. A year of service is defined as working 75%&gt; of the<br/>year required of full-time certificated employees.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time employees teaching less than 75% shall accumulate pro rata<br/>service credit until one year of service, as defined, is accrued. Such earned<br/>credit shall be applied in one-year increments at the beginning of the<br/>appropriate school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After initial credit is given, year-for-year credit shall be given for<br/>additional experience in the district.</p>
<p>Credit for Additional Course Work</p>
<p>C. All college credits and years of experience previously approved by the district</p>
<p>prior to July 1 shall be credited for placement on the salary schedule. Units after July 1<br/>shall be credited as they are earned subject to the conditions specified below: Satisfactory<br/>completion of each unit of approved college credit is required to advance from one salary<br/>class to another.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses to be credited for placement on the salary schedule must be<br/>recommended for approval by the principal prior to completion of the course. The<br/>superintendent or designee shall review such recommendation prior to approval<br/>being granted.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to units taken for credit on the salary schedule, the units must be<br/>upper division or graduate level courses.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request credit for a lower division course which is applicable<br/>to the employee’s current assignment. The principal must make a favorable<br/>recommendation for a lower division course to be considered. The superintendent<br/>or designee shall review such recommendation prior to approval being granted.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval shall be on a case-by-case basis, and no approval shall set a precedent.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory completion of each unit of approved college credit with a grade of<br/>“C” or better is required to advance from one salary column to another. “Pass” or<br/>“credit” is acceptable when letter grades are unavailable.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees attending conferences/workshops during non-duty hours may receive<br/>salary unit credit if they pay the tuition and all related costs (e.g.. travel, meals,<br/>lodging, etc.) and have received permission to take the units as provided by</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>district procedure.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units and degrees will be accepted only from accredited colleges and universities.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced training units to be credited for salary schedule placement shall be<br/>related to the teaching assignment. The superintendent may approve courses<br/>which, in the superintendent’s opinion, lead to the improvement of classroom<br/>instruction and/or job performance or to an additional educational credential.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units are defined for the purposes of this appendix as semester units. Three<br/>quarter units equal two semester units.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who anticipates column advancement on the salary schedule for the<br/>following school year must notify the superintendent’s office by April 15<sup>th</sup> of the<br/>preceding school year on a form provided by the district. Failure to observe this<br/>time deadline or the September 10<sup>th</sup> “receipt of transcripts or grade cards”<br/>deadline shall cause the units to be held to the next school year.</p>
<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An official transcript of courses completed, an official grade card, or a statement<br/>signed by the instructor or the registrar of the college or university that the course<br/>has been satisfactorily completed will be required no later than the last workday<br/>before September 10<sup>th</sup> to be applicable for salary schedule placement purposes for<br/>the school year.
