<p>Definitions</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; shall mean a claim by a unit member and/or association that<br/>there has been a misinterpretation, misapplication, or violation of this<br/>Agreement, which is filed by a grievant affected by the alleged violation,<br/>interpretation, or application.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “unit member” is any person represented under Article I of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;aggrieved person&quot; is the unit member and/or association making the<br/>claim.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the central administrative office of the District<br/>is open for business.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate supervisor” is the site administrator who has been<br/>designated to adjust grievances and who has immediate jurisdiction over<br/>the grievant.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to problems arising from<br/>allegations of unfair or inequitable treatment under this Agreement. Both<br/>parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any unit<br/>member having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any<br/>appropriate member of the Administration, and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted without intervention by the Association, provided that the<br/>adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible,<br/>the time limits specified at each level should be made to expedite the<br/>process. The time limits may however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than (one hundred) 100 days catastrophic leave.</p>

<p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the unit member's immediate family.</p>

<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member from his/her current site, grade level or program to another site,</p>
<p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade level or program within the District. The Superintendent is</p>
<p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible for the transfer of all certificated personnel within the District</p>
<p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to satisfy instructional requirements and to maintain instructional staff</p>
<p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;balance within the District.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exception: Placements in combination classes are not considered transfers</p>

<p>14</p>
<p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination has no more than two contiguous grade levels.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the grade levels is the same as the unit member’s current</p>
<p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placement.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is returned to the original grade level placement</p>
<p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after one year for a minimum of two years or if that unit member</p>
<p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wishes to remain in the combination class for more than one year,</p>
<p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that unit member is returned to the original grade level for a</p>
<p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimum of three years.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “voluntary” transfer is initiated by a unit member.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “involuntary” transfer is initiated by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is any day in which the central administrative office of the District</p>
<p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is open for business.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>33 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “vacancy” for transfer purposes is a position at a school location which</p>
<p>34 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the District has determined is to be filled by a probationary or permanent</p>
<p>35 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher rather than a substitute or temporary teacher.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “declared vacancy” refers to an unfilled position as declared and</p>
<p>38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;described by the Superintendent in a posted notice of vacancy. A position</p>
<p>39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be declared vacant unless:</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position occurs within twenty (20) days prior to the first<br/>student day.</p>
<p>G. After receiving from the POEA president a written list of apparent<br/>vacancies in question, the Superintendent shall supply written reason(s) for<br/>those positions not being “declared vacant.”</p>
<p>Voluntary Transfers</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be provided the first list of “declared vacancies” for<br/>the next school year on or before the third Wednesday of March.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request shall be made on the voluntary transfer form which<br/>will be a part of the “declared vacancy” list.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request shall be filed with the Superintendent on or before the<br/>fourth Friday of March.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be provided the second list of “declared vacancies” for<br/>the next school year on or before the third Wednesday of May.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second</p>
<p>“declared vacancy” list to take effect the next school year.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to filling a “declared vacancy,” all unit members with a transfer<br/>request on file for that “declared vacancy” shall have a conference with an<br/>administrator regarding that vacancy.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These conferences shall be initiated by the administration. In those<br/>instances where the requested position is filled by someone else, the unit<br/>member requesting the transfer will be notified. Upon request, the<br/>Superintendent will meet with that unit member to discuss the reasons for<br/>the decision,</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though no designated vacancy exists, a unit member may notify the<br/>Superintendent of a desire for change. This notification in no way<br/>obligates the Superintendent to take action outside of the process outlined<br/>in this Article.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If vacancies are declared after the second “declared vacancy” list has been<br/>distributed, the following process shall be followed:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request a transfer in writing. The request must<br/>be accompanied by a self-addressed envelope. Both the request<br/>and envelope must be on file in the District Office by the second<br/>Friday in June.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent will mail the “declared vacancy” list if a<br/>“declared vacancy” occurs.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must contact the Superintendent within five (5)<br/>days of the postmark on the envelope if he/she is interested in the<br/>position.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the envelope is returned to the unit member and he/she wants to<br/>remain informed of further “declared vacancies”, another self-<br/>addressed envelope must be submitted.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies need not be declared within twenty (20) days prior to the<br/>first student day.</p>
<p>Voluntary Intra-District Teacher Exchange</p>
<p>With the consent of the principal(s) involved and the Superintendent or designee,</p>
<p>any two (2) members of the unit at different sites or grade levels may choose to</p>
<p>exchange positions for a period of one (1) school year.</p>
<p>A. Such requests shall be made formally in writing to the District Office no<br/>later than April 1 prior to the school year in which the exchange is<br/>requested.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for any reason, either participant cannot fulfill the commitment, other<br/>than during the school year, the exchange is dissolved.</p>
<p>Involuntary Transfer</p>
<p>A. Involuntary transfer will be based primarily on the needs of the total<br/>educational program, including but not limited to the following criteria as<br/>determined by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to balance various teaching skills among the schools.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing pupil populations within the schools of the District,</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s background and preparation for the position.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>This evaluation program will be piloted in the 2006-2007 school year. It will be an automatic<br/>reopener in the 2007-2008 negotiation session to revise if needed and implement on a permanent<br/>basis.</p>
<p>1. Vision Statement</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental premise for a successful evaluation program shall be based on<br/>trust, mutual respect, confidentiality, fairness, equality and consistency.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of unit member evaluation are to:</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain and improve the quality of education in the District</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promote professional growth</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foster student achievement</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recognize competence and accomplishments</p>
<p>* acknowledge contributions beyond classroom duties</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be consistent/parallel with District and site goals</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that this evaluation system, based on the California Standards<br/>for the Teaching Profession, meets the requirements of Education Code Section<br/>44662 (Stull Bill Evaluation Process). Furthermore, these standards constitute the<br/>goals and objectives for all teachers in the Piner-Olivet Union School District.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers, whether in their year of formal evaluation or not, are expected to be<br/>familiar with mid working towards developing the practice of these standards.</p>

<p>The Piner Olivet Teachers Association (POEA) and the Piner Olivet Unified School District (District)<br/>agree to the following “formula” for the increase to be added to the salary schedule for the 2001/2002 and<br/>2002/2003 school years.</p>
<p>It is the intent of both parties to establish a long-term agreement that utilizes a formula.</p>
<p>The negotiating teams will meet in April of each school year that the formula is in effect to assess the<br/>impact and effectiveness of the formula based on current and future interests of the Association and the<br/>District.</p>
<p>The formula will remain in effect until the end of the 2005/2006 school year unless either party gives<br/>notice by the April meeting that they wish to amend the formula.</p>
<p>A Salary Formula Committee consisting of three (3) Association representatives and one (1) District<br/>representative will be formed to monitor the implementation of the formula. The committee will meet a<br/>minimum of four (4) times per year:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second week of school to review the current year enrollment and any needed staffing<br/>changes</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second week of October to review step and column placements, net savings generated by<br/>retirements, terminations, net increases/decreases related to leaves, and the maintenance of<br/>effort percentage based on the Unaudited Actuals</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second week of February to review the next year’s staffing</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last week of April to review P-2 ADA and next year’s preliminary budget.</p>
<p>At the end of each meeting, the committee will write up a summary of the information presented at that<br/>meeting. The summary will serve as the communication between the committee and the bargaining team.</p>
<p>The POEA salary schedules shall be increased by the following formula:</p>
<p>I. Components</p>
<p>A. Maintenance of Effort Percentage</p>
<p>The formula, through the Maintenance of Effort Percentage, guarantees a percentage of<br/>dollars of the District’s unrestricted general fund as outlined in the Salary Formula<br/>Revenue/Expenditure Worksheet (see attached) for unit members’ salaries and benefits<br/>(including health benefits). The agreed upon base Maintenance of Effort Percentage is 65.00<br/>percent. This percentage was adjusted in the 2000-2001 through 2002-2003 fiscal years for<br/>the salary equity program and adjusted by the one-time benefit cap increase to the base<br/>amount of not less than $400 for the 2001-2002 fiscal year. As of 2002-2003, the agreed upon<br/>Maintenance of Effort Percentage is 67.73 percent.</p>
<p>If this portion of the formula generates a further increase of more than .5%, the percentage<br/>will be added to the current year’s salary schedule and the increase will be retroactive to July<br/>1<sup>st</sup> of the prior year. If this portion of the formula generates a further increase of less than<br/>.5%, the percentage will be added to the current year’s salary schedule and will be retroactive<br/>to July 1<sup>st</sup> of the current year with the amount due from the prior year paid as an off-the-<br/>schedule bonus. If this portion of the formula generates a decrease, the percentage will be<br/>subtracted from the current year's salary percentage increase generated by items B through H.<br/>The total of Items A through I shall not be less than zero.</p>

<p>Revenue Components</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Base Revenue Limit (BRL) adjusted by the Funded Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)<br/>multiplied by the ADA (as a dollar amount) based on Form RL (Revenue Limit).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLUS any funded Equalization adjustment multiplied by the ADA (as a dollar amount) based<br/>on Form RL.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLUS the Unrestricted BRL revenues due to enrollment increase based on the projected P-2<br/>ADA (as a dollar amount).</p>
<p>The above will be adjusted by any revenue received for the charter schools that is then<br/>transferred from the District to the charter schools (flow through revenue).</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size Reduction revenue, revenue received from the charter schools for independent<br/>study program and interest revenue minus Tax Revenue Anticipation Note (TRAN) interest.</p>
<p>Expenditure Components</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLUS any net savings generated by retirement(s) or termination(s) in positions funded by the<br/>unrestricted general fund (as dollars) excluding those positions eliminated due to declining<br/>enrollment,</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLUS or MINUS any net increase or decrease due to leave/retuming from leave positions<br/>funded by the unrestricted general fund (as dollars).</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINUS step and column costs for POEA unit positions funded by the Unrestricted General<br/>Fund as of October 30.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any cost of any special education positions included in the calculations shall be calculated at<br/>the original sixty-five percent (65%) level of the amount subsidized by the unrestricted<br/>general fund.</p>
<p>H. Formula</p>
<p>The calculation of B through E will be based on the RL form. The calculation of F through I will be<br/>based on the actual experience of the current fiscal year (Unaudited Actuals) as determined at the October<br/>Salary Formula Committee meeting. The sum total of items F through I will be calculated as a dollar<br/>amount. The total calculated revenue dollar amount will be multiplied by the maintenance of effort<br/>percentage. That amount will be compared to the total calculated expenditure dollar amount to determine<br/>the total salary increase percentage that will be added to the salary schedules. For the purposes of this<br/>formula, the numerical result of items A through I shall not be less than zero.</p>
<p>The calculation of A through I will be completed by Oct. 15<sup>th</sup> with the salary increase to be made on the<br/>November payroll and retroactive checks on the either the regular November payroll or the December 10<sup>th<br/></sup>payroll.</p>
<p>m. Health Benefits</p>
<p>The amount available for the health benefit cap beginning with a base amount of not less than $400 for<br/>the 2001-2002 fiscal year will be adjusted each year by the percentage increase generated by the salary<br/>formula beginning with the 2002-2003 fiscal year. The amount will be rounded to the nearest whole<br/>dollar and added automatically. Any amount saved or extra amount spent still stays within the salary<br/>formula as a whole, so rounding does not have any overall effect. The health benefit cap relates only to<br/>the health premium and does not include the dental, vision or life insurance premiums.</p>

<p>IV. Other</p>
<p>The monies made available through this formula may, upon mutual agreement between the parties, be<br/>distributed on the salary schedule in a weighted manner, e.g. to provide greater increases on a specific<br/>step and/or column than applied to the base of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>In the event the District receives additional ongoing, unrestricted monies, the parties shall meet and<br/>negotiate the use of the funds.</p>
<p>In the event that the District does not receive a COLA on categorical programs, the parties shall meet and<br/>negotiate the effect on the formula.</p>

<p>5. Unit members on the CalSTRS Reduced Workload Program, E.C. 44922 (Willie Brown)<br/>may participate in job sharing subject to the provisions of the Article and the mandatory<br/>provisions of the applicable statutes. The District and Association understand that Sections<br/>I, J, K, and P above are not applicable to job shares involving one or two teachers who are<br/>participating in the Reduced Workload Program. This is due to the statutory requirements<br/>for the District’s contribution to health and welfare benefits, STRS and salary schedule<br/>movement to be the same as if the teacher was a full-time employee. In addition. Section O<br/>is subject to the following statutory amendment. “The option of part-time employment shall<br/>be exercised at the request of the employee and can be revoked only with the mutual consent<br/>of the employer and employee” {44922 (d)}.</p>

<p>At NWP, we value school-wide planning time each week and feel that it is an essential<br/>component of our school’s and students’ success. This early release time is used for a<br/>variety of purposes including, hut not limited to, project planning, WASC, enriching<br/>and understanding site programs, examining student assessment systems and data, team<br/>and subject area meetings, professional development and training, and other items if<br/>mutually agreed to by the staff and site administrator.</p>
<p>NWP School-Wide Planning Time is mandatory for all teachers, except by prior<br/>arrangement, and shall not extend beyond the normal work day. Planning time is from<br/>1:30 pm to 3:15 pm each Monday, with the instructional day being from 8:00 am to<br/>12:49 pm. The instructional hours on Tuesdays, Wednesday, Thursdays and. Fridays<br/>will be from 8:00 am to 3:15 pm. The Monday through Friday teacher work day will<br/>remain 7:50 am to 3:15 pm.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday collaboration time is created for the purpose of improving the educational program and its<br/>delivery for all students.

Interested teachers may also request<br/>raining during this time.</p>

<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student instructional time is reduced by one and half hours one day per week.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make up the instructional time, the school morning time is extended by 20<br/>minutes each student day.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday collaboration time is used in the following ways:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of two meetings a month focused directly on student learning: once a<br/>month Department meetings and once a month Team Teacher meetings.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole staff collaboration and planning with teacher input and Faculty meeting<br/>concerns.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday collaboration meetings will begin at 1:25 and finish by 2:50 p.m. or before.<br/>The agenda will be distributed at least 24 hours before the meeting. Teachers wanting to<br/>place specific items on the agenda will submit them in the manner agreed upon by the<br/>staff.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On shortened student days, teacher work hours will end at die usual time.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During report card/progress report time, Open House, Back to School Night, Orientation<br/>Night, etc., administration may allow for modification of the content of Wednesday<br/>collaboration meetings.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POCS staff meets weekly on Wednesdays. Monthly Faculty meetings will be conducted<br/>within the Wednesday meeting time. POCS will find a way to cover District meeting<br/>concerns within the Wednesday time frame and will not hold a separate District faculty<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>To support die implementation of Common core, POCS may need to use District Faculty<br/>Meeting hours during the 2014-2015 school year. If the District concerns can be covered<br/>within the regular 6 hours of meeting/collaboration time per month, die 6 hours of<br/>District Faculty Meeting time will not be required.</p>
<p>a) A Joint Committee of the POCS principal and two or more POCS teachers will<br/>meet to plan the use of up to 6 District Faculty Meeting hours after the<br/>District/Association Joint Committee meets in May/June, 2014 in order to align<br/>die POCS plan with the District plan. The POCS meeting will occur on or before<br/>the last POEA contract day.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The May/June meeting will be up to one full day, as necessary. Teacher<br/>Committee members will receive either release time or if a non-contract day,<br/>his/her pro-rated daily rate.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items to be included in discussions are clear goals for trainings, curriculum<br/>selection, benchmark assessments and other committee work for the following<br/>year. The Committee may also flexibly schedule the use of up to six hours of<br/>DFM time to support the goals, (e.g. six 1-hour mtgs, three 2-hour mtgs, or other<br/>combinations equaling six hours or less)</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjects of the Professional Development days (if any) may also be discussed<br/>by the Committee.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will plan for notification to all staff of the meeting subjects and<br/>schedule and for provision of appropriate reminders of each meeting at least one<br/>week in advance.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In scheduling the DFM hours, the Committee will not schedule meetings during<br/>weeks in which Back-to-School Night, Open House, testing, report card and/or<br/>conference day occur.</p>
