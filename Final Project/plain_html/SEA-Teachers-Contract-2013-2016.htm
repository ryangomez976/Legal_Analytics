However, it is understood that some instructional problems<br/>may not be resolved within the guidelines of these procedures. In such cases,<br/>other articles of this contract will apply.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the evaluation will be the evaluation plan, the teachers' job<br/>description, the requirements in the Education Code, and the California Standards<br/>for the Teaching Profession. The standards to be used are:</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is not resolved informally, the immediate supervisor shall request a<br/>conference as soon as is reasonably possible to discuss the complaint with the unit<br/>member, unless the immediate supervisor determines, with approval of the<br/>Superintendent or his/hers designee, that such conference would not be<br/>appropriate under the circumstances. The unit member may request, and a<br/>conference shall be held, within ten (10) duty days of such receipt.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal/immediate supervisor shall make every effort to resolve complaints<br/>in a timely manner. Such efforts shall include processing complaints during non¬<br/>duty days (i.e., summer) where the principal determines he/she can effectively<br/>process the complaint.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within twenty (20) duty days after the complaint surfaced, the principal/<br/>immediate supervisor shall present a full report regarding the investigation,<br/>including copies of all statements and other relevant documents, to the unit<br/>member, Superintendent or his/hers designee.</p>

Normally, twenty<br/>(20) minutes is designated as non-instructional conference time and will be identified in<br/>the bell schedule at each site. If a site determines that it is necessary to deviate from this<br/>provision in order to provide additional instructional minutes for innovative programming<br/>or professional growth, they may do so in accordance with Section 34.3.A.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools with a unique bell schedule (e.g. block schedules with ten [10] minute passing<br/>periods) may be exempt from this provision provided that they can demonstrate that their<br/>bell schedule includes a thirty (30) minute duty free lunch period with at least ten (10)<br/>minutes included as passing period time.</p>

<p>Page | 43</p>
<p>duty free lunch that day. The lunch will be scheduled by mutual agreement<br/>between the principal or his/hers designee and the unit member. Unless an<br/>emergency situation persists, the unit member will be provided the opportunity to<br/>schedule his/hers lunch during the day in which the time was lost.</p>
<p>C. The District shall provide additional clerical/custodial assistance during busy<br/>times in libraries such as book distribution and collection; such assistance shall be<br/>distributed equitably across all sites based on enrollment.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Split Shift and Split Site Assignments:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who volunteer may be assigned to a split shift at a site that has a seven</p>
<p>(7) period day. Teachers assigned to a split shift shall receive a stipend as set forth<br/>in Appendix C-4 for the semester they are assigned to the split shift. Unit<br/>members who teach six (6) periods over a seven (7) period day will receive both<br/>the one-sixth (1/6) per diem stipend and the split shift stipend.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may be required by the District to have split assignments between<br/>or among schools. Necessary travel time, lunch and preparation time will be<br/>flexible but will normally be included as part of their regular duty hours. Unit<br/>members assigned a semester split shift assignment between/among schools shall<br/>receive a stipend as set forth in Appendix: C-4. This split site shift stipend does<br/>not apply to unit members who are assigned to more than one (1) school because<br/>of assignments to:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra service assignments</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other hourly assignments</p>
<p>Extra service assignments are not considered teaching periods under this<br/>Agreement and are eligible only for the compensation listed in Appendix C-2 and<br/>Appendix C-3.</p>

A unit member may<br/>leave the school site, when necessary, after notifying a site administrator or designee.</p>
<p>12.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Coverage:</p>
<p>A. A site administrator may request that unit members provide replacement services<br/>during their preparation period for a temporarily absent teacher. The administrator<br/>shall first seek volunteers for such assignments, and shall make a reasonable<br/>effort to distribute assignments equitably and, unless an emergency exists, as<br/>defined by the principal, provide twenty-four (24) hours notification to the<br/>teachers who are requested to cover classes. The administrator shall keep a log of<br/>these assignments for inspection by unit members.</p>
<p>Page | 44</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who must be absent for less than one-half (V2) day in other than<br/>emergency situations must obtain their own substitute via the substitute desk or a<br/>colleague and must notify their principal in writing twenty-four (24) hours in<br/>advance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class coverage for a teacher who is attending a conference, in-service, or<br/>workshop may not be considered an &quot;emergency&quot; for the purpose of class<br/>coverage.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a teacher covers a class during his/her preparation period, pay for coverage<br/>of a class or any part of a class shall be as set forth in Appendix C-4.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other qualified personnel may be assigned to cover classes.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will not be dismissed from their teaching assignment to attend<br/>curriculum meetings and any other administratively authorized meetings unless<br/>the District is able to provide a substitute. This shall not apply to a unit member<br/>attending such meetings during their preparation time or times when a substitute<br/>is unnecessary.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing shall preclude teachers of non-athletic performing groups from attending<br/>field trips, workshops, or festivals with students during their regular teaching<br/>hours, providing said teachers have been able to obtain necessary class coverage<br/>through volunteers.</p>
<p>12.9 Extended Duty Day: The building principal has the right to direct and assign the work of</p>
<p>unit members during duty hours and may extend the length of the duty day for unit</p>
<p>members to:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend faculty meetings. Normally, only one (1) regularly scheduled faculty<br/>meeting shall be held per month. Under normal circumstances, the principal shall<br/>provide the unit members with an agenda for faculty meetings one (1) day in<br/>advance. In order to assist bargaining unit members with daily planning, faculty¬<br/>meeting agendas will provide an estimate of the expected duration of the faculty<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend parent conferences as needed, unless the unit member has an unavoidable<br/>conflict. The unit member will then establish a meeting with the parent as soon as<br/>possible.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend principal/unit member conferences (one [1] day prior notification will be<br/>given unless an emergency exists). A reasonable effort shall be made to schedule<br/>such conferences during the unit member's regular duty day.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervise students as needed (one [1] day prior notification will be given unless<br/>an emergency exists). Assigning supervision of students will not be made in an<br/>arbitrary and capricious manner. These assignments will be made as equitably as</p>
<p>Page | 45</p>
<p>is possible. A master list of assignments, teachers assigned and teachers who are<br/>excluded from supervision will be made available to staff and to the FAC.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participate in activities related to curriculum development, including accreditation<br/>activities/PQR/WASQ (one [1] week prior notification, including an agenda with<br/>the approximate length of the meeting, will be given unless an emergency exists).<br/>Bargaining unit members shall not be required to attend more than four (4) such<br/>activities during a school year. In any year in which a school site is subject to a<br/>PQRAVASQ review, the principal of the site may require unit members to attend<br/>six (6) days of such activities. A reasonable effort shall be made to schedule such<br/>activities during the unit member's regular duty day.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When unit members are required to return to school for open house, report card<br/>night, parent information evenings, or student project nights, that day shall be<br/>declared a minimum day for unit members. Such activities, including dates and<br/>number of activities shall be discussed with the FAC. A school site may elect on a<br/>sixty percent (60%) of the members voting, to provide its unit members with the<br/>option of declaring a minimum day on the day before or after open house.<br/>Counselors at the site will be included in this vote.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intent of the District to modify the District's practice in implementing<br/>this section. The District shall not require teachers assigned to a late shift or an<br/>early shift in a school that has a seven (7) period or more teaching day to extend<br/>their workday for the purpose of attending faculty meetings.</p>
<p>12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty hours of ROP and other hourly paid unit members shall not exceed forty (40)<br/>hours per week unless mutually agreed to by the unit member and his/her<br/>principal/supervi sor.</p>
<p>12.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid duties assigned during the unit member's duty hours outside of the preparation<br/>period and classroom-teaching periods shall not be made in an arbitrary and capricious<br/>manner. The impact of these assignments on traveling teachers shall be on the agenda of<br/>the FAC. The intent is that the FAC will address the impact and make recommendations<br/>for accommodations for these teachers.</p>
<p>12.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who feed or monitor handicapped students during lunch receive per diem pro<br/>rata pay for this duty.</p>
<p>12.13 Newly Hired Unit Members: Employees scheduled to be assigned to full-time<br/>assignments who are new hires to the District may volunteer to attend a District<br/>sponsored in-service which may be scheduled prior to the opening of school at the<br/>Administration Center or other sites identified by the District.</p>
<p>A. The length of the daily in-service meetings will be approximately six (6) hours.</p>
<p>Page | 46</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New employees will be granted hurdle credit for attendance at this in-service. The<br/>District may also provide substitutes for new teachers when this in-service is held<br/>on a duty day and the teacher wishes to attend.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New employees who do not attend the in-service meetings prior to the opening of<br/>school will not be subject to discipline because of non-attendance nor will it be<br/>reflected in their evaluation.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will designate one (1) day for the Association to meet with the new<br/>employees for approximately two (2) hours’ time during one (1) of the days<br/>scheduled as an in-service day listed herein.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This provision is contingent upon approval of the in-service by the Board of<br/>Trustees.</p>
<p>Page | 47</p>
<p>ARTICLE 13</p>
<p>EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referrals to the employee assistance program will not be recorded in the evaluation or<br/>any other document to be placed in the personnel file of the employee.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may send a letter to an employee recommending his/her participation in the<br/>program. Said letter shall contain a statement that participation in the program is entirely<br/>voluntary and confidential, and that participation or non-participation will not be asserted<br/>by the District in any action taken against the employee by the District. The letter shall<br/>inform the employee that a copy of the letter will not be placed in the employee's<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees it will not raise as a defense, and/or as an issue in any action<br/>against the District, that the District did or did not refer an employee to the employee<br/>assistance program.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will notify all employees through a general notice sent to their work sites of<br/>the availability, and information about the employee assistance program.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 14</p>
<p>EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>14.1 Purpose of Evaluation Procedures:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressed purpose of the evaluation procedures outlined in this article is the<br/>improvement of instruction and the professional growth of the certificated unit<br/>members in District schools. Evaluation and assessment of each unit member<br/>shall be made on a continuing basis as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least once each school year for probationary unit members.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every other year for unit members with permanent status.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every five (5) years for unit members with permanent status who<br/>have been employed at least ten (10) years with the District, are highly<br/>qualified, if necessary, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801, and whose<br/>previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards,<br/>if the evaluator and the unit member being evaluated agree. The unit<br/>member or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time. Consent may<br/>not be withdrawn for arbitrary or capricious reasons. (See Appendix J.)</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedures detailing the evaluation of teachers are designed to operate in an<br/>atmosphere of mutual agreement and professional respect. Where it becomes<br/>necessary to resolve and remediate problems in classroom instruction, these<br/>procedures continue to operate in that same atmosphere of mutual agreement and<br/>professional respect. However, it is understood that some instructional problems<br/>may not be resolved within the guidelines of these procedures. In such cases,<br/>other articles of this contract will apply.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the evaluation will be the evaluation plan, the teacher’s job<br/>description, the requirements in the Education Code and the California Standards<br/>for the Teaching Profession. The standards to be used for classroom teachers are:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and Supporting All Students in Learning</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for All Students</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing Student Learning</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a Professional Educator</p>
<p>Page | 49</p>
<p>7. Progress of Students toward District or State Standards</p>
<p>D. Unit members who are not classroom teachers will use standards that will be<br/>developed collaboratively by the District and Association. These standards will be<br/>mutually agreed upon by both parties. As they are developed, they will be added<br/>to the contract by side letter.</p>
<p>14.2 Personal and Academic Freedom:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal life of a unit member shall not be a subject of this formal evaluation<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to study any controversial issue in the classroom, related to the<br/>objectives of that class, which has political, economic, or social significance and<br/>is not in conflict with Board policy, shall not be a subject of this evaluation<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>14.3 Overview of the Evaluation Procedures:</p>
<p>A. This article establishes a dual-track evaluation procedure, each with specific</p>
<p>evaluation criteria designed to improve instruction and professional growth.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PROFESSIONAL GROWTH TRACK is designed to allow<br/>certificated unit members to define a program of professional growth for<br/>the period of evaluation and to be evaluated in terms of that program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will be discussed with the evaluator and a statement of<br/>achievement or progress will be completed at the end of the evaluation<br/>period. Unit members in the PROFESSIONAL GROWTH TRACK will<br/>be evaluated biennially.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SUPPORT TRACK is designed to assist unit members in specific<br/>areas of improvement of instruction. In the 7-12 program all temporary<br/>and probationary unit members will be placed in this track as well as other<br/>unit members who have received an &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; or &quot;requires<br/>improvement&quot; in the composite evaluation section of the evaluation form.<br/>Unit members serving in the first two (2) years of an hourly assignment<br/>will be placed in this track. Unit members in the SUPPORT TRACK will<br/>be evaluated annually.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting to discuss the evaluation process will be held within thirty (30)<br/>duty days of the beginning of the school year. This meeting may include<br/>all unit members to be evaluated in a single group. Individual meetings<br/>may also be scheduled by evaluators.</p>
<p>Page | 50</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer School/Intersession</p>
<p>Unit members employed for Summer School or Intersession shall be evaluated<br/>according to the following categories:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those unit members who request an evaluation be performed;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those unit members who are teaching in Sweetwater Union High School<br/>District for the first time.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling Disputes</p>
<p>When a dispute: arises during the evaluation process, a meeting with a member of<br/>Human Resources, the Association, the site evaluator and the unit member may be<br/>scheduled by either the evaluator or the unit member. Disputes concerning the<br/>development of the growth plan are not subject to this section. However, disputes<br/>over changes to the established growth plan will be subject to this section.</p>
<p>14.4 The Professional Growth Track:</p>
<p>A. Professional Growth Track Placement</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certified 7-12 unit member with permanent status, or an hourly<br/>employee in the third year of service or beyond, will be placed in the<br/>PROFESSIONAL GROWTH TRACK.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement in the PROFESSIONAL GROWTH TRACK is automatic if all<br/>SUPPORT TRACK evaluations have been satisfactory.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be placed on the PROFESSIONAL GROWTH<br/>evaluation cycle during his/her “off’ year if concerns are identified and<br/>validated through documentation. A growth plan in the area of concern<br/>will be developed.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal may decide to &quot;continue&quot; a unit member's evaluation from<br/>one (1) year to the next. The following criteria will be followed:</p>
<p>a. The decision to &quot;continue&quot; an evaluation is made when the<br/>evaluator has expressed concerns over the performance of the unit<br/>member, but decides that the full impact of a negative evaluation is<br/>unwarranted and that more time should be allowed before coming<br/>to judgment. These concerns, however, will have been documented<br/>by the evaluator and will have been discussed with the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marking the &quot;continue&quot; box simply postpones the official evaluation.<br/>It does not constitute a negative evaluation, nor should it be<br/>interpreted as such. Probationary and temporary unit members and<br/>other unit members in SUPPORT TRACK cannot be &quot;continued.&quot;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If concerns remain at the end of that extension period, the evaluation<br/>may be continued for one (1) more year only, at which time the<br/>summary evaluation report must be completed. No record of<br/>continued evaluations shall be kept past the completion of the next<br/>evaluation period.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of continuing an evaluation period is to make every effort<br/>to assist, counsel and direct the unit member in improving his/her<br/>classroom instruction. The decision to &quot;continue&quot; an evaluation shall<br/>not be made in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</p>
<p>Establishing a Professional Growth Track Plan</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements of the Professional Growth Track are designed to give<br/>maximum flexibility to both the evaluator and the unit members being<br/>evaluated in fixing dates for meetings, observations and discussions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual growth plans will be submitted by unit members within thirty<br/>(30) duty days of the meeting to discuss the growth plans as described<br/>above. The focus of the growth plan will be one or two (2) of the standards<br/>(14.1.C.).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various aspects of the plan details, purposes, measures of progress<br/>within this plan-may be discussed with the evaluator. It is the intent that<br/>both the evaluator and the unit member will agree on the details of this<br/>plan. The District and the Association may propose a list of professional<br/>growth activities for unit members to consider, but such a list is advisory,<br/>and is only meant to offer suggestions and assistance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any continuing or unresolved disagreement between the<br/>evaluator and unit member over the details of this plan, then the unit<br/>member will make the final decisions concerning the content, purpose,<br/>direction and/or scope of the plan.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other meetings to discuss the progress of the professional growth plan<br/>may be held at any time in the second semester with the dates and times<br/>determined by mutual agreement. This program of professional growth<br/>will be discussed with the evaluator and a statement of achievement or<br/>progress will be given to the evaluator prior to the summary evaluation<br/>conference.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Growth Track Classroom Observations and Conference’s</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observation(s) will be scheduled at a mutually agreed upon time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscheduled, informal observations may be made by the administrator.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferences following an observation will be scheduled at a mutually<br/>agreed upon time.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both classroom observations and conferences may be waived by mutual<br/>consent, but if either party wishes to schedule a formal observation or a<br/>conference, then arrangements will be made at a mutually convenient<br/>time.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Growth Track Time Lines</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) duty days of the beginning of school, a meeting between<br/>the evaluator and the unit member being evaluated shall be held to discuss<br/>procedures.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) duty days of the initial meeting, unit members shall<br/>submit their growth plan to the evaluator.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations must be completed and signed by both evaluator and unit<br/>member no later than April 30.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member may be rated as less than satisfactory, an<br/>assistance plan in accordance with Section 14.7 shall be developed by the<br/>end of the first week of the second semester.</p>
<p>14.5 The Support Track:</p>
<p>A. Placement</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SUPPORT TRACK is designed to assist unit members in specific<br/>areas of improvement of instruction. All temporary and probationary unit<br/>members will be placed in this track. Evaluations for those in the<br/>SUPPORT TRACK will be done yearly.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated 7-12 unit member with permanent status, or an hourly<br/>employee beyond the third year, may be placed in the SUPPORT TRACK<br/>whenever the unit member has received an &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; or &quot;requires<br/>improvement&quot; in the composite evaluation section of the evaluation form.</p>
<p>Page | 53</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining a Support Track Growth Plan</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the SUPPORT TRACK a growth plan will be determined by mutual<br/>agreement. The scope of this plan is a matter for discussion between the<br/>evaluator and the unit member being evaluated. The focus of the growth<br/>plan will be one (1) or two (2) of the standards found in Section 14.1.C.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both evaluator and unit member will agree on the growth plan that will<br/>serve as the basis of the composite evaluation. Agreement on the growth<br/>plan in the SUPPORT TRACK must be made within forty-five (45) duty<br/>days of the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is disagreement over the content, purpose, direction, or scope of<br/>the plan&quot; the evaluator will make the final decisions.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If circumstances warrant such action, the plan agreed to in Section 14.5.B,<br/>may be changed during the evaluation cycle. This new plan is subject to<br/>mutual agreement by both parties. If there is disagreement regarding the<br/>plan, the evaluator will make the final decision. The unit member may<br/>appeal the decision in accordance with Section 14.3 .C, of this Agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable amount of time must be allowed for the accomplishment by<br/>the unit member of any new plan. No additions to the plan will be set after<br/>ninety (90) duty days from the beginning of the employee's assignment. A<br/>change in the content, purpose, direction or scope of the original plan can<br/>only be made one (1) time during the ninety (90) day cycle.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support Track Classroom Observations</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both formal and informal observations will be made. Scheduling of formal<br/>observations will be arranged by mutual consent and it is understood that<br/>unscheduled informal observations will also be made.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members in the SUPPORT TRACK shall have a formal<br/>observation by a site administrator within the first forty-five (45) duty<br/>days of service. A second observation shall take place no later than twenty<br/>(20) duty days after the first observation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-observation data sheet may be required prior to a formal<br/>observation. There should be mutual agreement concerning the details and<br/>scope of this requirement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post-observation conference will be scheduled within two (2) weeks<br/>(ten [10] duty days) after any formal observation.</p>
<p>Page | 54</p>
<p>D. Support Track Timelines</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) days of the beginning of the school year, or the<br/>beginning of service, a meeting shall be held to discuss the evaluation<br/>procedures.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within fifteen (15) duty days of the initial meeting, the growth plan for<br/>unit members shall be established.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than sixty (60) duty days after the beginning of service, a meeting<br/>shall take place between the evaluator and the unit member to assess<br/>progress. At this time, the unit member shall be notified in writing if the<br/>evaluator has determined it is possible the unit member may receive a less<br/>than satisfactory evaluation. If this is the case, an assistance plan in<br/>accordance with Section 14.7 shall be developed to allow the District to<br/>provide the assistance necessary for the unit member to take action in<br/>correcting any cited deficiencies.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a plan is developed, the evaluator and unit member shall meet at<br/>least once every twenty (20) duty days to assess the success of the<br/>assistance plan. These meetings shall continue until the deficiencies have<br/>been corrected or until the school year ends.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary and probationary employees shall be evaluated every year. The<br/>evaluation must be completed by March 15. The evaluation for permanent<br/>employees must be completed by April 30.</p>
<p>14.6 General Provisions:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member beginning service during second semester will be evaluated at a<br/>time sequence other than the ones described above. The growth plan will be<br/>established within twenty (20) duty days of the beginning of service and at least<br/>forty-five (45) duty days will be allowed for the completion of the growth plan. In<br/>any case, a reasonable amount of time must be allowed in order to accomplish the<br/>plan.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the completion of the evaluation, a summary evaluation conference shall<br/>be held. At this meeting the evaluator and the unit member shall review the<br/>evaluation report in order to discuss the final wording.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final evaluation report shall be signed by both the evaluator and the unit<br/>member. The signature of the unit member does not mean or imply agreement or<br/>disagreement with the evaluation. It only means that the evaluation has been<br/>received.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has the right to include an addendum to any written evaluation.</p>
<p>Page | 55</p>

In the absence of a demand for a full evidentiary hearing,<br/>the Superintendent or his/her designee shall act upon the charges after the time period for<br/>the hearing demand has expired.</p>
<p>A. The full evidentiary hearing shall be conducted before a hearing officer. The<br/>hearing officer shall be selected pursuant to the Voluntary Labor Arbitration<br/>Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Such hearings shall take place<br/>within a reasonable period of time but not before five (5) calendar days after the<br/>filing of a request for a hearing. Hearings will be presided over by the hearing<br/>officer. The employee shall have a right to appear in person on his/her own<br/>behalf, or with Association representation. The Association will have the right of<br/>attendance as a party of interest in the hearing.</p>
<p>Page | 81</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing and shall make a determination of<br/>the issues and finding of facts as well as ruling on questions, evidence, procedure<br/>and appropriateness of the proposed suspension.

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearings will be recorded at the request of either party with such expense being<br/>borne by the requesting party. The non-requesting party may receive a copy of the<br/>recording by paying one-half (V2) the cost.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has been found by the hearing officer to be improperly<br/>suspended without pay, the District will reimburse the unit member for lost pay<br/>plus seven percent (7%) simple interest from the date of loss of compensation to<br/>the date of payment.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will maintain the confidentiality of the suspension.</p>
<p>20.5 With respect to probationary employees whose probationary period commenced during</p>
<p>the 1983-84 fiscal year or any fiscal year thereafter, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the suspension provided in Section 20.2 hereof, the parties<br/>acknowledge that such probationary employees may be dismissed or suspended<br/>without pay for a specified period of time in excess of fifteen (15) workdays<br/>under Education Code section 44948.3. Among the reasons that may be deemed<br/>sufficient by the District to dismiss or suspend without pay such probationary<br/>employees are:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory performance determined pursuant to the Stull Act<br/>(Education Code section 44660, et. seq.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause, as defined in Education Code section 44932</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee shall give thirty (30) days prior written<br/>notice of dismissal no later than March 15 in the case of second year probationary<br/>employees. Notice of the suspension without pay shall be given pursuant to<br/>Section 20.3.

In the event of a dismissal<br/>or suspension for unsatisfactory performance, a copy of the evaluation conducted<br/>pursuant to Education Code section 44664 shall accompany the written notice.</p>
<p>C. If the notice of dismissal or suspension is given; the employee shall have fifteen<br/>(15) calendar days from receipt of the notice of dismissal or suspension to submit<br/>to the Board a written request for a hearing. The failure of an employee to request<br/>a hearing within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of a dismissal or<br/>suspension notice shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. The hearing<br/>provided for in Section 20.4 shall constitute the hearing on the dismissal or<br/>suspension. However, the hearing officer's decision shall constitute a<br/>recommendation to the Board and shall be advisory only.</p>
<p>20.6 This article supersedes the suspension section provided for in the Education Code.</p>

<p>22.2 Sick Leave and Other Related Sick Leave Benefits for illness or Injury for Unit</p>
<p>Members:</p>
<p>A.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every unit member who is regularly employed five (5) days per week is<br/>entitled to ten (10) days of paid sick leave for each year of employment.<br/>Unit members who work less than full-time shall be entitled to a<br/>proportionate amount of paid sick leave. For unit members paid at an<br/>hourly rate, sick and injury leave benefits shall be computed on the basis<br/>of one (1) hour sick and injury leave for each eighteen (18) hours of<br/>service rendered to the District. Unit members who work an extended<br/>school year contract shall be entitled to a proportionate amount of paid<br/>sick leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave granted in Section 22.2.A.1, above is defined at current annual<br/>sick leave. All unused sick leave shall be accumulated from one (1) school<br/>year to the next school year. This is defined as accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each school year, every unit member shall receive a<br/>sick leave allotment credit, equal to his/her sick leave entitlement for the<br/>school year. A unit member may use his/her credited sick leave at any<br/>time during the school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members, when absent due to sickness of injury, shall receive full<br/>pay for said absence by using their current annual sick leave days and/or<br/>their accumulated sick leave days.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members who use all of their sick leave and subsequently fail to<br/>serve their assigned school year, shall have deducted from their final pay<br/>warrant the amount paid as provided in Section 22.2.B.3, for the number<br/>of days used beyond the earned sick leave.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Sick Leave Benefits:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a unit member has depleted his/her available sick leave<br/>including the leave granted for the current year and all accumulated sick<br/>leave, and illness or injury compels further absence, he/she will be entitled<br/>to an additional one hundred (100) days of sick leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the one hundred<br/>(100) day period shall run consecutively.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be provided more than one (1), one hundred (100)<br/>day period per illness or accident. However, if a school year terminates<br/>before the one hundred (100) day period is exhausted; the employee may</p>
<p>Page | 86</p>
<p>take the balance of the one hundred (100) day period in the subsequent<br/>school year.</p>
<p>4. During this one hundred (100) day period the amount deducted from the<br/>salary of the unit member shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a<br/>substitute employee employed to fill his or her position during his/her<br/>absence or, if no substitute employee was employed, the amount that<br/>would have been paid to the substitute had he/she been employed. The<br/>District shall make every reasonable effort to secure the services of a<br/>substitute employee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee may<br/>require a physician's verification of illness when a unit member has been on sick<br/>leave for six (6) or more consecutive days. This does not preclude the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee from requesting<br/>additional verification when there is a demonstrable pattern of leave use that<br/>suggests the leave is being abused. Such requests for additional verification shall<br/>not be made in an arbitrary and/or capricious manner. The Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her designee may require a<br/>physician’s verification of illness during any period of concerted activities.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use up to six (6) days per year (which may be consecutive),<br/>deductible from current or accumulated sick leave, to care for an ill child, parent,<br/>or spouse.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members can take no more than five (5) consecutive days of personal<br/>necessity leave. The Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her<br/>designee may approve the use of additional days for special circumstances.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member uses personal necessity leave for a non-emergency situation,<br/>the unit member must notify the principal/supervisor at least forty-eight (48)<br/>hours in advance. When the leave is for an emergency, the unit member shall<br/>notify the principal/supervisor as soon as possible for use of personal necessity.<br/>The use of the automated substitute notification system constitutes appropriate<br/>notification.</p>
<p>Page | 87</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member does not elect to use sick leave for personal necessity as<br/>provided herein, then a per diem salary deduction shall be made for each working<br/>day absent in accordance with the provisions of this article.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity leave under Section 22.3 may not exceed the total<br/>accumulation of the unit member up to the total of sixteen (16) days of permitted<br/>accumulation. The Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or his/her<br/>designee may approve the use of additional days for special circumstances.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity leave shall not be used for concerted action of any kind against<br/>the District. If the District has reasonable cause to believe a unit member is<br/>abusing the provisions of this section, appropriate disciplinary action may be<br/>taken.</p>

The Board shall not deduct accumulated sick leave from the<br/>sick leave allotment of a unit member who is absent as the result of an industrial<br/>accident or illness until the unit member has used all of his/her industrial illness<br/>and accident leave.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entitlement to industrial accident or illness leave has been exhausted, other<br/>sick leave benefits under Section 22.2 of this article will then be used; however, if<br/>an employee is receiving workers' compensation, the District shall use only as<br/>much of the unit member's accumulated or available sick leave, which, when<br/>added to the workers' compensation award, will provide for a full day's wage or<br/>salary.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Catastrophic Illness&quot; is defined to mean an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate a unit member for an extended period of time, and the incapacity<br/>requires the unit member to take time off from work for an extended period of<br/>time.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may donate to the Catastrophic Leave Bank, using the form found<br/>in Appendix G under the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may donate from one (1) to six (6) days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must have at least twenty (20) days of accrued sick leave to<br/>make a donation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donation will be irrevocable.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A donation to the Bank will be a general donation and shall not be donated<br/>to a specific unit member for his/her exclusive use.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only members who have donated to the Bank: may apply to withdraw days from<br/>the Bank.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members (or their agents) may apply to use the Bank: by submitting their request<br/>to the Catastrophic Leave Bank: Review Committee using the appropriate District<br/>form, (Appendix G). Included with the form will be verification of the<br/>Catastrophic Illness prepared in writing by a licensed physician of the state of<br/>California.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank: Review Committee will consist of two (2)<br/>members selected by the Association, one (1) member from each of the employee<br/>groups participating in this Bank, and two (2) members selected by the District.<br/>The committee will review all applications. Approval of any request will require a<br/>majority vote of the committee. The decision of the committee shall be final and<br/>binding. Within ten (10) duty days of receipt of employee application, the<br/>committee will notify (in writing) the applicant of its decision. All applications<br/>submitted to the committee shall remain confidential and comply with the terms<br/>of the federal HIPAA privacy regulations, 45 C.F.R. 164.508 and the<br/>Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, Cal Civ. Code 56 et seq.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member may request a maximum of twenty (20) days per application.<br/>At the end of the twenty (20) day period an additional twenty (20) days<br/>may be requested or granted if the event was originally expected to have<br/>duration of forty (40) days or longer for a maximum of forty (40) days to<br/>be used per catastrophic event.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days granted but not used will be returned to the Bank. One (1) day used<br/>will be equal to one (1) day at the member's rate of pay.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave granted under this Agreement will be coordinated with the fifty<br/>percent (50%) leave to create a full day of wages. The Sick Leave Bank<br/>will be debited one-half (1/2) day for each day used. The coordination of<br/>Catastrophic Leave and fifty percent (50%) pay will not extend the one<br/>hundred (100) days entitlement per event.</p>
<p>Page | 92</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank: may not be used for illness or disability which<br/>qualified the unit member for worker compensation benefits.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Catastrophic Leave Bank: Review Committee reasonably<br/>presumes that the applicant may be eligible for a disability award or a<br/>retirement under STRS, the committee may request that the unit member<br/>apply for the disability or retirement. Failure of the unit member to submit<br/>a complete application within twenty (20) days of the request shall<br/>disqualify the unit member from further catastrophic leave Bank<br/>payments.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By August 1, of each year, the balance in the Bank will be reconciled. The<br/>Association will be notified of the balance.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will be reviewed annually and the parties may mutually<br/>agree to make appropriate modifications to this program in writing.</p>

<p>27.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval of the employee's request shall be predicated upon District staffing<br/>requirements with consideration given to the strengths of employees so that a balanced<br/>curriculum meeting the adopted policies of the Board is provided. If all considerations<br/>stated herein are equal, length of District service will determine the teachers selected<br/>under the provisions of this article.</p>
<p>27.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee's retirement contributions and the District's contributions will be pro-rated<br/>in accordance with STRS regulations.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 28</p>
<p>PRE-RETIREMENT REDUCTION IN WORKLOAD</p>
<p>In accordance with Education Code section 44922, a unit member may reduce his/her workload<br/>prior to retirement from full-time duties and receive the same credit toward retirement he/she<br/>would have received if he/she were employed on a full-time basis. Regulations governing this<br/>provision are as follows:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have attained the age of fifty-five (55) years by September 1, of the<br/>school year in which work reduction begins.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have been employed as a full-time certificated employee for at least<br/>ten (10) years, of which the last five (5) years were in full-time employment in the<br/>District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entry into the five (5) year Part-Time Employment Plan must be exercised at the request<br/>of the employee and termination of the plan thereof can be only with mutual consent of<br/>both employee and employer. (Final approval of employee participation would rest with<br/>the District). It is understood that at the termination of the unit member's participation in<br/>the Part-Time Employment Plan, the employee will begin his/her retirement. However, in<br/>the event of proven hardship, the District may grant an exception (e.g., death, divorce,<br/>bankruptcy, etc.).</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option to participate in the Part-Time Employment Plan shall be through written<br/>request of the employee to the Human Resources Department. Such a request as noted<br/>above is to be submitted on a District prepared form. Applications should be submitted<br/>annually by May 1.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be paid a salary which is the pro rata share of the salary he/she would<br/>have earned had he/she not elected to exercise the option of a Part-Time Employment,<br/>but shall retain all other rights and benefits for which he/she makes the payments that<br/>would be required if he/she remained in full-time employment. The employee shall<br/>receive all fringe benefits as provided in section 53201 of the Government Code in the<br/>same manner as a full-time employee.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum and maximum Part-Time Employment shall be as follows: Unit members must<br/>teach at least half-time to be eligible for the program. The selected work schedule may<br/>consist of teaching either one hundred percent (100%) of one (1) semester, and zero<br/>percent (0%) of the other, or another part-time assignment as defined in Article 27, Part-<br/>time Employment; Section 27.3.</p>
<p>Non-classroom employees who are unit members will be required to be on duty either:<br/>one hundred percent (100%) of one (1) semester and zero percent (0%) of the other<br/>semester; or another part-time assignment for the entire year, hours as mutually agreed<br/>upon.</p>
<p>Page | 105</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deductions for STRS contributions by the District and by the part-time employee shall be<br/>equal to the amount required of a full-time employee. Deductions are to be made on a<br/>monthly basis depending on the pay program selected by the employee.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member participating in this plan will earn sick leave in proportion to the<br/>percent of employment per year. Example: Fifty percent (50%) (half-time) employment<br/>would yield sick leave of fifty percent (50%) of ten (10) days or five (5) days of sick<br/>leave. Such sick leave would be cumulative.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will announce annually the availability of the Part-Time Employment Plan to<br/>all employees.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All provisions of this program will be available to each employee through building<br/>principals and administrative department heads.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating employees will be scheduled for individual meetings by the Human<br/>Resources Department to develop a mutually agreeable program for the employee on or<br/>before May 30.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where two (2) or more employees apply for the same part-time position, such position<br/>shall be filled by the employee with the greatest District-wide seniority.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who participate in the Part-Time Employment Plan will perform extra duties<br/>proportionate to full-time employees. (Half-time employees will perform half [1/2] as<br/>many duties as full-time employees).</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written request by an authorized Association representative, the District shall<br/>provide the Association with a list of unit members who have been approved for Part-<br/>Time Employment for the following year.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement between the District and the participating unit member shall be<br/>consummated on or before June 10. (The unit member may be accompanied by an<br/>Association representative in any meeting he/she attends with the District, pursuant to<br/>this article).</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for participation in the program shall be completely voluntary and at the<br/>discretion of the employee.</p>
<p>Page | 106</p>
<p>ARTICLE 29</p>

The Association<br/>shall indemnify and hold harmless the District from any claims, demands, or lawsuits<br/>arising out of the implementation of this section.</p>
<p>29.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the Board to fulfill the<br/>provisions of this article.</p>
<p>29.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon appropriate written authorization from a unit member, the Board shall deduct from<br/>the salary of such unit member and make appropriate remittance for annuities, credit<br/>union, savings bonds, charitable donations, or any other plans or programs jointly<br/>approved by the Association and the Board.</p>
<p>29.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall indemnify and hold the District harmless from any claims,<br/>demands, or lawsuits arising out of or from the agency service fees provisions contained<br/>in this Agreement.</p>
<p>29.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those bargaining unit members who are on paid leave including part-time employees<br/>shall continue to pay dues to the Association if they have voluntary dues authorization<br/>cards on file.</p>
<p>29.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members with payroll authorization on file who are on unpaid leave of<br/>absence shall have said authorization continue in effect upon return to active duty unless<br/>appropriately cancelled pursuant to this article.</p>
<p>29.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall deduct an agency fee from the wages of all employees who have<br/>elected not to join the Association and who have not paid an agency fee directly to the<br/>Association. The amount of agency fee must not exceed regular Association dues. Any</p>
<p>Page | 107</p>
<p>employee who has elected not to join the Association has the right to pay the agency fee<br/>in a lump sum payment directly to the Association.</p>
<p>29.9 Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any bargaining unit member who is a<br/>member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to<br/>joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join,<br/>maintain membership in, or financially support any employee organization as a condition<br/>of employment, except that such unit members are required, in lieu of payment of the<br/>agency fee to the Association, to pay an amount equal to the current Association's agency<br/>fee to any non-religious, non-labor organization, charitable funds exempt from taxation<br/>under section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code as approved by the<br/>Association. Proof of payment to any fund shall be made on an annual basis to the<br/>Association.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 31</p>
<p>SAFETY CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree the safety of all unit members is a priority.</p>
<p>31.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe Work Environment: A unit member shall not knowingly be required to work or<br/>engage in any activity that can reasonably be deemed hazardous to life or limb. The<br/>District will provide a safe and secure campus and work locations. Should the situation<br/>involve student health and/or safety, unit members may be requested to assist.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member should make a conscientious effort to notify his/her<br/>principal/supervisor of known or suspected unsafe working conditions, facilities<br/>and equipment. Within five (5) working days, the principal/supervisor shall<br/>provide the unit member with a verbal response that either concurs or disagrees<br/>with the determination by the unit member that a particular condition is unsafe.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the initial assessment concurs that a condition is unsafe, and the unsafe<br/>condition persists for a period of time in excess often (10) working days, the unit<br/>member may initiate the formal response process by completing the form<br/>provided in Appendix F of this Agreement and submitting it to the<br/>principal/supervisor and to the Association. Within five (5) working days of<br/>receipt of the completed form, the site administrator will, on the form provided in<br/>Appendix F, respond with a plan of remediation, which includes a specific<br/>schedule of implementation.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the initial assessment does not concur that a condition is unsafe, or the unit<br/>member is not satisfied with the resolution in (B.), the unit member may continue<br/>the formal response process by completing the form provided in Appendix F of<br/>this Agreement and submitting it to the District Safety Officer and to the<br/>Association. Within five (5) working days, the District will, on the form provided<br/>in Appendix F, provide a response to the unit member and the FAC explaining the<br/>District's position.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have representatives on the Injury Illness Prevention Plan<br/>Committee and the Security Working Group.</p>

The teacher shall immediately report the suspension to the<br/>principal of the school and send the pupil to the principal or the principal's designee for<br/>appropriate action. If that action requires the continued presence of the pupil at the school<br/>site, the pupil shall be under appropriate supervision as defined in policies and related<br/>regulations adopted by the governing board of the District.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible, the teacher shall ask the parent or guardian of the pupil to<br/>attend a parent teacher conference regarding the suspension.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlawfully possessed, used, sold, or otherwise furnished, or been under<br/>the influence of any controlled substance, as listed in Chapter 2<br/>(commencing with section 11053 of Division 10 of the Health and Safety<br/>Code, an alcoholic beverage, or an intoxicant of any kind.)</p>

<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowingly received stolen school property or private property.</p>
<p>No pupil shall be suspended or expelled for any of the acts enumerated<br/>unless that act is related to school activity or school attendance occurring<br/>within a school under the jurisdiction of the superintendent or principal or<br/>occurring within any other school District.

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an individualized instruction/independent study teacher determines a home<br/>teaching environment imminently threatens the safety of that teacher, the teacher<br/>will leave the home and immediately contact his or her supervisor. The bargaining<br/>unit member will, within three (3) working days, provide a list, using the form in<br/>Appendix F that identifies all safety concerns the bargaining unit member has<br/>about the home teaching environment. The supervisor will provide a response<br/>within five (5) working days specifying an appropriate future course of action.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is concerned he or she does not have the necessary and<br/>appropriate support personnel and/or equipment to provide a safe environment for<br/>the unit member, because of the behavior of a particular special education student,<br/>that unit member shall notify the principal, or his or her administrative designee,<br/>of the problem in writing. Such notification shall include a specific list of</p>
<p>concerns and any recommended solutions. Within seven (7) duty days the<br/>principal, or his or her administrative designee, will schedule a meeting of the<br/>Individualized Educational Plan Team (IEP Team) to reevaluate the IEP and<br/>make adjustments, if necessary.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 34</p>
<p>TEACHING ASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>34.1 Development of Teaching Assignments:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site principal shall make a form available to unit members on which they may<br/>submit their preferences for a teaching assignment for the ensuing year. The unit<br/>member may submit the form by April 1 to the principal.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tentative draft of each department's teaching assignments, (i.e., number of<br/>sections) shall be submitted by the principal to the department for its reaction and<br/>input.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall consider the input obtained through these measures and<br/>through consultation with the FAC in developing the teaching assignments.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in this Agreement, full-time 7-12 unit members serving in<br/>classroom teacher assignments shall have no more than five (5) class periods<br/>assigned with students and the sixth period shall be a preparation period. The six</p>
<p>(6) periods shall be consecutive. Each period of the 7-12 day shall be<br/>approximately sixty (60) minutes in length. If the implementation of an innovative<br/>schedule results in a different configuration, such as a block schedule, the unit<br/>member shall be guaranteed the equivalent of five (5) preparation periods per<br/>week.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that a unit member is assigned<br/>to no more than three (3) preparations. A &quot;reasonable effort&quot; shall not include the<br/>addition of staff or a reduction in the number of courses offered.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the approval of any teacher, the District may assign that teacher to teach six</p>
<p>(6) periods during the first semester and four (4) periods during the second<br/>semester with no increase or decrease in compensation.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals shall consult with affected unit members prior to making reassignments<br/>for the second semester.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments shall not be made in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special education teachers shall have the equivalent of at least nine (9) days a<br/>year to work on IEP's, testing, and consultation. These teachers, in collaboration<br/>with the School Psychologist and the site administration, shall have the option of<br/>&quot;pooling&quot; these days and redistributing them according to the needs of the site.<br/>Days that aren't used for IEP's, testing or consultation may be used for staff<br/>development that has a special education focus.</p>
<p>Page | 121</p>
<p>J. Online and Credit Recovery classes offered or contracted by the district shall be<br/>taught by qualified unit members. Any classes offered to our students outside the<br/>district are excluded. Open positions will be staffed by qualified unit members in<br/>accordance to Article 35, Transfer. Additional training may be required of<br/>selected unit members and provided by the district.</p>
<p>34.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Schedule:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master schedule for semester I shall be on the agenda and discussed at FAC<br/>meetings at least once per month during March, April and May. The master<br/>schedule for semester II shall be on the agenda and discussed at least once per<br/>month during November, December and January for schools following a<br/>traditional calendar and during October, November and December for schools<br/>following a year round calendar.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A draft master schedule for semester I, which contains all proposed assignments<br/>for the following semester's schedule, will be presented to the FAC during an<br/>FAC meeting no later than the third Monday of May.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A printed copy of each year's tentative master schedule shall be posted by June 1<br/>of each year. A revised tentative master schedule shall be posted by the first duty<br/>day for teachers.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second semester tentative master schedules shall be posted four (4) weeks prior to<br/>the start of the semester.</p>
<p>34.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modification of Instructional Program/Innovative Schedules:</p>
<p>A. Each period of the 7-12 day shall be approximately sixty (60) minutes in length.<br/>The length of class periods may be modified by the principal to allow for other<br/>instructional programs after consulting with the FAC and the change is approved<br/>by a sixty percent (60%) site unit member vote.</p>
<p>The programming of advisory, silent reading and nutrition break are not<br/>considered as teaching periods under this section. Unit members assigned to<br/>advisory, SSR, directed study, or any other such program, will not be required to<br/>give scholarship grades in those classes.</p>
<p>In addition, a principal and unit members may modify the class periods to provide<br/>for innovative scheduling provided that sixty percent (60%) of the unit members<br/>voting approve for this modification. The following procedures will be followed<br/>for considering and implementing an innovative schedule:</p>
<p>1. New Programs: An innovative schedule may be suggested for study by<br/>consensus of the FAC or by a petition signed by twenty-five percent<br/>(25%) of the unit members at the site. When an innovative schedule is</p>
<p>Page | 122</p>
<p>approved for the first time, the plan will include a time line for periodic<br/>evaluations. The FAC will ensure that an evaluation will occur yearly.<br/>Adjustments may be made as a result of the evaluation. By May 15 of the<br/>third year, the staff will vote to either continue or discontinue the current<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sites implementing an innovative schedule shall be required to offer<br/>on-going staff development training.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a current program is discontinued, or a proposal does not receive the<br/>necessary vote for implementation then that same proposal cannot be<br/>reconsidered for a period of three (3) years unless it can be clearly<br/>demonstrated that significant changes have taken place at the site.</p>
<p>34.4 One-Sixth Assignments:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of one-sixth (1/6) assignments will be announced at the site<br/>through normal means of communication such as bulletin notices, faculty<br/>meetings, and e-mail. Unit members may volunteer to teach a sixth period subject<br/>to the restriction in Sections 33.4.B., and 33.4.C., below. First consideration for<br/>selection will be given to unit members who were not assigned a sixth teaching<br/>period the previous year. No teacher shall teach a seventh period.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-sixth (1/6) per diem assignments in the 7-12 school assignments (excludes<br/>Learning Center, Special Education, and Resource positions) will be calculated<br/>and capped by site as follows:</p>
<p>High School one-sixth (1/6) per diems:</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> Semester &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Semester &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site</p>
<p>Middle/Junior High School one-sixth (1/6) per diems:</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> Semester &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Semester &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site</p>
<p>The District agrees that it is not the intent of this modification to reduce the<br/>number of teaching positions. If the total of one-sixth (1/6) teaching assignments<br/>in a discipline or subject area reaches the equivalent of a 0.8 FTE assignment, the<br/>District shall post the vacancy for hiring. In addition, teachers who are assigned a<br/>sixth period under the provisions of Section 33.4.B., are not calculated in the<br/>assignment of teachers under this section.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each semester, the Association will be provided with a report on the use of one<br/>sixth (1/6) per diems.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 35</p>
<p>TRANSFER</p>
<p>35.1 Definitions:</p>
<p>For the purpose of transfer within the Sweetwater Union High School District, the</p>
<p>following definitions will hold:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer is defined as a change in regular assignment from one (1) 7-12 School<br/>or site to another 7-12 school or site within the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary transfer is one initiated by a unit member in the regular 7-12 School<br/>program in the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary transfer is one initiated by the District due to declining<br/>enrollment, declining F.T.E. (verified by site data at the time of an involuntary<br/>transfer), and/or demonstrable instructional need(s) in accordance with the needs<br/>of the District. Supportive data shall be discussed with the FAC.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrative transfer is a change in regular assignment from a school site<br/>initiated by the District.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An open position is any full-time position on a site master schedule which is not<br/>assigned to a permanent or probationary unit member. Temporary positions shall<br/>not be designated as open positions.</p>
<p>The FAC will be notified on the first day of the semester of any open positions<br/>remaining. Postings for open positions shall be in accordance with Section 35.2.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary positions will be identified by the District at each site. Such<br/>positions will be designated in accordance with the provisions of the Education<br/>Code. The number of temporary positions will not exceed the number of<br/>temporary unit members authorized by the Education Code. Temporary positions<br/>are not subject to posting requirements.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority is defined as the longest number of years of District seniority as defined<br/>by the Education Code.</p>
<p>35.2 Voluntary Transfer:</p>
<p>A. The District shall post on the Human Resources webpage, provide to the<br/>Association and school sites via district e-mail, and via district e-mail<br/>communication to each member.</p>
<p>Page | 124</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postings will be made the first working day of May, June, July, and<br/>August, May 15, and June 15, two (2) weeks prior to the start of semester<br/>I, and ten (10) duty days prior to the start of semester H</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation of an open position by any resignation, retirement, death, or<br/>otherwise separates from the District, or increased enrollment during<br/>semester I will be posted for semester n. Any other positions which are<br/>open after the final posting for that semester will be filled at the discretion<br/>of the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second semester vacancies will be posted for the next semester on the<br/>same basis as postings made pursuant to Section 35.2.A.2.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting dates other than those identified will be at the discretion of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All postings shall be for a minimum of six (6) duty days and shall contain<br/>a closing day for submitting requests for transfer.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No assignments to fill the open positions shall be made until after the<br/>closing date.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall determine temporary positions. The number of<br/>temporary positions will not exceed the number of temporary employees<br/>authorized by provisions of the Education Code.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each posting must contain information on work location, subject areas to<br/>be taught, required credentials and special qualifications, if applicable.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All full-time class size reduction positions must be posted unless they are<br/>determined to be temporary.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positions designed to replace a teacher on leave for a year or less will be<br/>given to the teacher returning from leave. If the teacher does not return<br/>from leave in a year, the position becomes an open position.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a posting includes more than a single subject area, then the area with<br/>three (3) or more sections will be listed first. In this case, the subject listed<br/>first will be the area used to determine whether an applicant has a point for<br/>major/credential in the subject area of the posting. The area that has more<br/>sections will be used to determine points under the criterion of Section</p>
<p>35.2.B.1.</p>
<p>If no one (1) subject area has more sections than the others, one (1) of the<br/>subject areas with the higher number of sections will be listed first. That</p>
<p>Page | 125</p>
<p>subject area listed first will be given the points for major/credential under<br/>the criterion.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a posted position becomes void, postings of that position will be voided<br/>on the next posting. Postings of voided positions must be canceled prior to<br/>posting any position which contains all or part of the assignment specified<br/>by the voided position.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the District opens a new school, the provisions of this article<br/>shall apply only to one-half (V2) of the positions identified to staff the new<br/>site. All other positions shall be filled in accordance with District needs.<br/>The Association and the District shall meet to determine the period of time<br/>for which this provision shall apply.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association may mutually agree to exclude specific<br/>positions with unique requirements from the posting/selection provisions<br/>of this article.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, a District representative and representative of the<br/>Association will meet with a Human Resources administrator to discuss<br/>the information and procedures of postings to unit members.</p>
<p>B. Unit members who desire a transfer to a posted open position may file a transfer<br/>application with the Human Resources Department. Applications of all qualified<br/>unit members will be sent to the site principal for selection. The site principal will<br/>screen the applicants for consideration. Unit members will not be eligible for<br/>voluntary transfer during the first year of their probationary period.</p>
<p>If there are six (6) or more qualified unit member applicants for the posted<br/>position(s), then a unit member shall be selected for the position(s).</p>
<p>If there are five (5) or fewer qualified unit member applicants, then the District<br/>may select non-unit member(s) for the position(s).</p>
<p>On-site unit members will be considered for open positions before the position is<br/>posted. Unit members may make their interest in potentially available positions<br/>known through use of the assignment preference form or through direct<br/>communication with the site principal or the FAC.</p>
<p>The following criteria shall be used by the principal in selecting an applicant for<br/>the posted position. In the event of a tie, these criteria shall be applied in rank<br/>order:</p>
<p>1. Major, primary authorization or authorization listed on a specialist<br/>credential.</p>
<p>Page | 126</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingual specialist, bilingual certificate of competence, bilingual<br/>emphasis credential.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous performance evaluations.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility of credential.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra service.</p>
<p>C. Application of Criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major/Minor Credential: The intent of this criterion is to give preference<br/>to those with majors in the field of the posting over those with minors in<br/>the field. This criterion may be met by having a &quot;major&quot; listed as such on<br/>the credential (standard secondary); it may be listed as a major on college<br/>transcripts; it may be listed as the primary authorization in a single subject<br/>credential or a specialist credential.</p>
<p>If an applicant (lacking a major in the posted position) has a minor or<br/>supplementary authorization and has taught in a specific subject for ten<br/>(10) years or more, he or she will receive a point for major/credential. The<br/>burden of providing satisfactory proof to the District of such experience<br/>rests with the applicant.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilingual: Only those credentials listed in Section 35.2.B.2, are<br/>recognized for points under the application of this criterion. Applicants<br/>must hold one (1) of the listed bilingual certificates to receive a point in<br/>this category. Only Spanish and Tagalog certificates will be counted<br/>within the scope of this criterion. The Bilingual Fluency Exam (FSI<br/>Standard) shall be dropped from the criterion.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority: Only District seniority is applicable in voluntary transfers. The<br/>most senior remaining applicant (in later rounds) receives a point.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations: The last two (2) performance evaluations must have an<br/>overall satisfactory rating in order for the applicant to receive a point.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility of Credential: An applicant shall receive a point for being<br/>credentialed to teach three (3) or more subjects. A CLAD credential, LDS<br/>certificate, and ELD certificate shall be included among the credentials<br/>that may be considered for the awarding of an extra point.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra Service: An applicant will receive a point for extra service if the<br/>applicant agrees to serve in a specifically identified extra service</p>
<p>assignment for one (1) year. Extra service assignments shall not be<br/>indicated on the posting of the teaching assignment.</p>
<p>7. Tie Breaker: If there is a tie among applicants, the rank order of criteria<br/>will be used to break the tie. If rank order does not determine a selection,<br/>the selection shall be made by the principal.</p>
<p>When offered the transfer position, a unit member has five (5) duty days<br/>after District notification to accept the offered position. If the first unit<br/>member fails to accept the offered position, the unit member with the next<br/>highest number of points shall be offered the position until the position is<br/>filled.</p>
<p>If a teacher resigns from a position after having accepted the position, the<br/>new open position will be posted if it falls within a posting period<br/>specified within this article.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are considered but not selected for the posted position will be<br/>notified of their non-selection. They may also request a written statement from the<br/>Human Resources Department or designee indicating the reasons the unit member<br/>was not selected.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each Board meeting, the Association shall be provided the employment,<br/>change of status, and separations of certificated personnel.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the summer months and Intersession periods, a unit member may leave a<br/>letter on file with the District and with the Association indicating his/her transfer<br/>desires should a position arise.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, one (1) day of instruction free duty time for preparation and<br/>orientation in the affected school shall be allocated to the unit member being<br/>transferred if school is already in session. In order to facilitate the change in<br/>assignment, custodial services shall be provided at the request of the unit member.</p>
<p>35.3 Involuntary Transfer:</p>
<p>A. If a reduction of staff is necessary at a school site, the principal shall determine<br/>the staffing needs of the school site. The principal will discuss the staffing needs<br/>with the FAC. When an involuntary transfer is necessary at the school site, the<br/>principal shall first solicit unit members to voluntarily transfer. If no unit member<br/>volunteers to transfer, the following criteria shall be used by the principal in<br/>identifying the individual to be transferred:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staffing needs</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credential, major, minor, and/or special considerations</p>
<p>After the principal, with input from the FAC, has determined the area(s) of<br/>subject(s), and reduction(s), the following seniority system shall be considered to<br/>identify the involuntary transfer(s):</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longest number of years of District seniority as defined by the<br/>Education Code;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longest number of years of consecutive service at the school or<br/>site;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longest number of years of service with the department;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District's ability to place the involuntary transfer(s) at another<br/>site.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7-12 school involuntary transferees shall be notified in writing as soon as<br/>practicable after the need for transfer is confirmed. All notices of involuntary<br/>transfer shall include the reason for the involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>An involuntary transferee shall be given the right of the first refusal to his/her<br/>original site for vacancies for which he/she qualifies which occur within twelve</p>
<p>(12) months of the date of transfer.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, one (1) day of instruction free duty time for preparation and<br/>orientation in the affected school shall be allocated to the unit member being<br/>transferred whether voluntary or involuntary if school is already in session. In<br/>order to facilitate the change in assignment, custodial services shall be provided at<br/>the request of the unit member.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or about December and June of each year, the involuntary transferees, teachers<br/>returning from special assignment, and persons returning from leave will be<br/>identified. The District, in consultation with the Association, will determine<br/>which positions are to be withheld from posting so they can be offered to the<br/>involuntary transferees and persons returning from leave.</p>
<p>The District will attempt to fill positions within thirty (30) days prior to the start<br/>of the semester or by June 15.</p>
<p>Any withheld positions not taken by an involuntary transferee, teachers returning<br/>from special assignment, or persons returning from leave will be posted, unless<br/>the position(s) are identified as temporary positions. The involuntary transferees,<br/>teachers returning from special assignment, and persons returning from leave will<br/>be given a chance to select from this pool of available positions.</p>
<p>Page | 129</p>
<p>Involuntary transferees will select available positions in order of District<br/>seniority. They will be given one (1) chance to select a position from this pool<br/>afterwards the unit member(s) should apply for posted positions for which they<br/>qualify.</p>
<p>After July 1, the District may place involuntary transferees, teachers returning<br/>from special assignment, and unit members returning from leave in accordance<br/>with the needs of the District. Placement may not be arbitrary or capricious, nor<br/>shall it restrict the right of a bargaining unit member to otherwise apply for<br/>transfers in accordance with this article.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall adjust its portion of the &quot;minimum instructor pay&quot; upon receipt<br/>of the most current documentation from the military.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;minimum instructor pay&quot; of ROTC instructors and all adjustments thereto,<br/>shall occur independent of the 7-12 salary schedule contained in the Collective<br/>Bargaining Agreement.</p>

<p>36.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Day:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members assigned to teaching classes which extend outside the regular<br/>student school day shall be paid pro rata per diem. Summer School/Intersession,<br/>Adult School, ROP, and other hourly paid unit members are specifically excluded<br/>from this provision.</p>

<p>APPENDIX B-l</p>
<p>SALARY CLASSIFICATION AND SALARY RECLASSIFICATION</p>
<p>Salary Placement:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary classification will be based on accredited college or university credits in<br/>professional and academic training.</p>
<p>Salary schedules include a series of annual increments from the minimum salary<br/>to a maximum salary range and that a unit member shall be granted one (1)<br/>increment for each year of satisfactory service until the maximum salary of<br/>his/her salary classification is reached. Consistent with the Education Code a year<br/>shall be defined as contract service for seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the<br/>number of days the regular schools are maintained. The Board’s policy relative to<br/>seventy-five percent (75%) of the working days of a person’s assignment relative<br/>to eligibility for increment is interpreted as follows:</p>
<p>Any unit member under contract for seventy-five percent (75%) of the<br/>working days including sick leave, but excluding leaves without salary or<br/>personal leave, will have met the requirements for eligibility for an<br/>increment for the following year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All previous teaching experience shall be recognized for initial salary placement<br/>of new teachers. In addition, military experience since January 1, 1970, shall be<br/>recognized for initial salary placement of new teachers. Initial salary placement<br/>shall be made by the Division of Human Resources in accordance with the<br/>following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) step credit for each year of verifiable teaching experience.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) step credit for each two (2) years in military service up to a<br/>maximum of three (3) steps.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum placement on the ninth step for a combination of the above for<br/>7-12 unit members hired prior to January 1, 2003. The maximum<br/>allowable step placement will increase by one (1) year each January, until<br/>January 1, 2007, at which time all previous teaching experience (in<br/>accordance with A. 1. above) will be credited to newly hired teachers. For<br/>example: unit members hired after January 1, 2003, may be hired at a<br/>maximum of Step 10; unit members hired after January 1, 2004, may be<br/>hired at a maximum of Step 11.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum placement on the third step for a combination of the above for<br/>Adult Education unit members.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years of teaching experience outside of the District which were previously<br/>recognized, even though not granted, by the District for initial salary placement<br/>credit shall be recognized the same as in District experience for advancement to<br/>Step 18, 22 and 26 for Class V, VI and VII of the 7-12 salary schedule. Teaching<br/>experience previously verified by the District at the time of employment may be<br/>credited to an employee for anniversary placement, if requested at the completion<br/>of Step 14 of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years of teaching experience outside of the District which were previously<br/>recognized, even though not granted, by the District for initial salary placement<br/>credit shall be recognized the same as in-District experience for advancement to<br/>Step 18, 22 and 26 for Class I, II and III of the Adult Education salary schedule.</p>
<p>Salary adjustments become effective July 1.</p>
<p>B. Salary Reclassification</p>
<p>Credit will be granted for upper division and graduate courses taken at an accredited<br/>college or university, subsequent to the bachelor’s or master’s degree, which are directly<br/>related to assignment and/or better preparation for unit member assignments.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accredited college or university courses that are specified as upper division or<br/>graduate courses completed on transcript, and continuing education units (CEU)<br/>are automatically acceptable if they meet one (1) of the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses required to obtain a California teaching credential, current license<br/>or certificate necessary for placement or continued employment.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses taken from a school of education or a sponsoring institution<br/>which meets standards as recognized by national, state, and local<br/>professional organizations appropriate to the unit member’s assignment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses taken in the major or minor as verified on transcript.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses related to current assignment.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses related to obtaining a second major or minor.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses for travel supported by college or university transcripts and the<br/>travel is related to the unit member’s assignment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower division courses may be considered for unit members for salary<br/>reclassification provided that prior approval is obtained based on the following<br/>criteria:</p>
<p>Page | 139</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower division college or university courses that directly relate to major<br/>or minor subject areas of teachers and/or to verified teaching of unit<br/>members assignments.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower division courses that will contribute more to better preparation for<br/>teaching assignment than upper division or graduate courses; or that they<br/>are prerequisite to upper division or graduate courses felt to be essential.</p>
<p>3. For purposes of salary advancement, CEU’s will be converted to semester units<br/>on the basis of fifteen (15) class hours = one (1) semester unit.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory completion of District funded workshops are acceptable for salary<br/>reclassification credit. Repeat credit for District workshop is not acceptable.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member must file application for reclassification on the salary schedule no later<br/>than September 30, for semester I, and February 28, for semester II.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be eligible for reclassification, verification of course work through official<br/>transcripts shall be on file with the Human Resources Department no later than<br/>December 31, for semester I, and May 31, for semester II.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to either apply or provide verification correctly will automatically cancel<br/>eligibility for reclassification for that semester. Salary adjustments for academic<br/>training shall be retroactive to the beginning of the unit member’s respective<br/>semester work schedule.</p>
<p>Page | 140</p>
