<p>ARTICLE 4: ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of the Association, or who has applied for<br/>membership, may sign and deliver to the District a written statement authorizing deduction of<br/>initiation fees and membership dues in the Association. Such authorization shall continue in<br/>effect for the duration of this Agreement unless revoked in writing. Pursuant to such<br/>authorization, the District shall deduct one tenth (1/10) of such dues from the regular salary<br/>warrant of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit members who<br/>sign such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall be appropriately<br/>prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year. The District shall not be obligated<br/>to put into effect any new or changed deduction until the pay period which commences thirty<br/>(30) days or more after such submission.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member who after the effective date of this Agreement is a member of the<br/>Association and each unit member who becomes a member after that date shall, as a condition of<br/>continued employment, maintain his/her membership in the Association through the term of the<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>4.2.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, the District shall automatically<br/>deduct the appropriate service fee on behalf of the Association from the regular salary warrant of<br/>any unit member who is not a dues paying member of the Association and who has failed to<br/>execute a written statement authorizing deduction of such a service fee.

In such case, the unit member shall pay to a qualified charitable organization,<br/>approved by the District, an amount equal to a normal Association initiation fee and membership<br/>dues excluding funds for political action, as a condition of continued employment. Disputes<br/>involving this section of the article shall be settled between the Association and the employee<br/>and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure under Article 5.</p>

The District shall invoice the Association within fifteen (15)<br/>working days of the incurring of cost and the Association shall reimburse the District within<br/>fifteen (15) working days of receipt of invoice. In the event payment is not timely made in<br/>accordance with this provision, the District shall be relieved of any and all responsibility and all<br/>obligations to proceed with any unit member's dismissal initiated herein.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District, the District will remit such monies to<br/>the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members from whom such<br/>deductions have been made, and indicating any changes in personnel from the list previously<br/>furnished.</p>
<p>4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the</p>

<p>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having immediate<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant who has been designated by the District to adjust grievances. The<br/>District superintendent will designate the &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; if this is not clearly<br/>understood.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; shall mean the Association or any unit member filing a grievance,<br/>pursuant to the definition of a grievance in Section 5.1.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance, and<br/>before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an informal<br/>conference with the grievant's immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level</p>
<p>5.3.1 Level 1</p>
<p>5.3.1.1 Within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to</p>
<p>the grievance, the grievant must present such grievance in writing on the appropriate form to the</p>
<p>immediate supervisor. This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance,</p>
<p>including the specific provision(s) of this agreement alleged to have been violated and the</p>
<p>specific manner in which the provision(s) has been violated, the factual events supporting this</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>claim, the decision rendered at the informal conference, and the specific remedy sought. A<br/>conference will be held with the grievant, the association representative, and the district<br/>representative within ten (10) days after presentation of the written grievance form to the<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>5.3.1.2 The supervisor shall communicate a decision to the grievant in writing within<br/>ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does not respond within the time<br/>limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level. Within the above time limits, either party may<br/>request a personal conference with the other party.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2</p>
<p>5.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level 1, the<br/>grievant may appeal the decision on the appropriate form to the superintendent or designated<br/>administrative officer within ten (10) days. This statement should include a copy of the original<br/>grievance, the decision rendered, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the appeal.<br/>The superintendent or designee shall communicate a decision within ten (10) days after receiving<br/>the appeal. Either the grievant or the superintendent or designee may request a personal<br/>conference within the above time limits. If the superintendent or designee does not respond<br/>within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Mediation Prior to Level 3</p>
<p>5.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the time limits for appeal to Level 3, if the grievant or the Association is<br/>not satisfied with the decision at Level 2, the District or Association may request that the<br/>grievance be submitted to mediation prior to proceeding to Level 3 of the grievance procedure.<br/>Upon mutual agreement to utilize this step, the District shall contact the California State<br/>Conciliation Service and request that a mediator be appointed.</p>
<p>5.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the mediator shall be to assist the parties to achieve a mutually</p>
<p>satisfactory resolution of the grievance. The mediator shall have no power to render a decision</p>
<p>or make a public recommendation on the grievance. Any statements made during the mediation</p>
<p>Q</p>
<p>process shall be confidential and shall not be admissible in any future court or administrative<br/>proceeding.</p>
<p>5.3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset of this process, the mediator shall schedule a meeting at a<br/>mutually agreeable time for the purpose of resolving the matter through mediation. The<br/>mediation shall be limited in duration to eight (8) hours.</p>
<p>5.3.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is achieved by means of this<br/>mediation process, both parties to the grievance shall sign a written statement to that effect and<br/>thus waive the right of either party to any further appeal of the grievance.</p>
<p>5.3.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no satisfactory settlement of the grievance is reached through this process<br/>within the time limits contained within Section 5.3.3.3, either party may appeal the grievance to<br/>the next level (Level 3).</p>
<p>5.3.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expense of the mediator shall be borne equally by the District and<br/>the grievant or Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>5.3.4 Level 3</p>
<p>5.3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level 2, or<br/>if no written decision has been rendered on or before the Level 2 decision deadline, within ten<br/>(10) days following such deadline, the grievant may request the Association to submit the<br/>grievance for arbitration.</p>
<p>5.3.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Association decide to take the grievance to arbitration, it shall notify<br/>the grievant and the District of its intent to proceed within fifteen (15) days of the request by the<br/>grievant by sending the grievant and District a copy of the request to the California State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service for a list of seven (7) names of arbitrators. The arbitrator<br/>shall be selected by the parties from the list by alternately striking one (1) name. The party<br/>making the first strike shall be determined by lot. The last remaining name shall be the</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>arbitrator.</p>
<p>5.3.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such question shall<br/>be ruled upon by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall render an expedited decision on the question<br/>of arbitrability prior to the parties being required to present evidence on the merits of the<br/>grievance. The arbitrator's decision on the merits of the grievance will be in writing and will set<br/>forth the findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions of the issues submitted. The decision shall<br/>be rendered within thirty (30) days after close of the hearing of receipt of post hearing briefs.<br/>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the District and the Association.<br/>All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>5.3.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the arbitrator shall<br/>determine the issues by referring to the written grievance and the answers thereto at each step.<br/>The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of the Agreement<br/>or the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures of the District. Issues arising out of the<br/>exercise by the Board of Education and administration of its responsibilities under Article 3 of<br/>this Agreement, &quot;District Rights,&quot; including the facts underlying its exercise of such discretion,<br/>shall not be subject to this procedure.</p>
<p>5.3.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written<br/>arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties the findings and recommendations<br/>which shall be binding to the parties. The arbitrator's decision must be limited to the specific<br/>issue or issues submitted to him/her, and based upon the arbitrator's interpretation of meaning of<br/>the language of the agreement.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Action Grievances</p>
<p>If two or more persons have the same grievance, such persons may elect to consolidate the<br/>grievance. The signatures of such persons must be present on the grievance form to indicate<br/>their election. The decision shall apply to all parties.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision of Grievant Pending Disposition of Grievance</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Until final disposition of a grievance takes place, the grievant is required to conform to the<br/>original direction of his/her supervisor, except in matters relating to the real and actual physical<br/>danger to immediate inimical welfare of the grievant.</p>
<p>5.6 Miscellaneous</p>
<p>5.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not agree to a resolution of a formal grievance until the<br/>Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given<br/>the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>5.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any grievant to<br/>discuss a grievance informally with his/her immediate supervisor, or to have the grievance<br/>adjusted, prior to Level 2, without intervention of the Association, provided that the adjustment<br/>is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. Any proposed resolutions at Levels 1 and 2<br/>shall not be agreed upon by the District until the Association has been provided with a copy of<br/>the grievance, proposed resolution, and reasons therefore, and has been provided an opportunity<br/>to respond.</p>
<p>5.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at a level above the principal or immediate supervisor, the grievant may submit<br/>such grievance in writing to the superintendent directly and the processing of such grievance will<br/>be commenced at Level 2. Failure to appeal a decision at any given level within the specified<br/>time limits finalizes the decision rendered at that level.</p>
<p>5.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time<br/>limits specified at each level should be followed completely and every reasonable effort should<br/>be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>5.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all<br/>the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the last teacher workday, at the end of the</p>
<p>school year, it will continue following &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until resolved.</p>

Unit members shall complete reports concerning safety conditions which<br/>might be required by the District.</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may suspend a student from his/her class for the day of the suspension and<br/>the day following, for good cause, and shall report the suspension to the principal and send the<br/>student to the principal for appropriate action. The teacher shall notify the parent and participate<br/>in the subsequent parent conference.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may utilize the same degree of physical control over a pupil that a parent<br/>would be legally privileged to exercise, but which in no event shall exceed the amount of<br/>physical control reasonably necessary to maintain order, protect property or protect the health<br/>and safety of pupils, or to maintain proper and appropriate conditions conducive to learning.</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be advised of any students assigned to them who have caused or<br/>attempted to cause serious bodily injury or injury to another person insofar as that information is<br/>available to the district. The language contained in 7.1.3 does not create any fewer or greater<br/>association rights than exists in Education Code 49079.</p>
<p>7.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall maintain a communication system between classrooms and the<br/>office.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall make every effort to maintain a safe and healthy classroom<br/>environment within their control, responsibility, and expertise. This includes, but is not limited<br/>to, classroom pets and upholstered furniture, which may result in an unhealthy classroom<br/>environment. Specific guidelines shall be developed jointly by the Association and the District<br/>and included in faculty handbooks.</p>
<p>IQ</p>
<p>7.2.1 Unit members shall inform their immediate supervisor in writing of any suspected<br/>unsafe conditions. The immediate supervisor shall have the unsafe condition inspected by<br/>appropriate District personnel. If the District determines that an unsafe condition exists, the<br/>District shall take appropriate remedial action as it deems necessary to address the unsafe<br/>condition.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examinations for Tuberculosis shall be required of all unit members every four years.<br/>The District will reimburse the employee for the examination.</p>

<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At work stations where the temperature exceeds 85° F, or falls below 60°F in the<br/>classroom and/or air conditioning heating units or systems have become inoperable for a period<br/>of more than two hours, site administrators shall give the unit member the option to relocate the<br/>class into an air conditioned/heated facility, where possible. The superintendent/designee will<br/>consider ordering minimum days for students and unit members for the next school day if the<br/>temperature is forecasted to remain the same or exceed the condition of the previous day and the<br/>air conditioning/heating systems are inoperable. This language does not preclude the parties<br/>from agreeing to maintaining the status quo and does not preclude the superintendent/designee<br/>from determining minimum days for other reasons that affect health and/or safety of students and<br/>staff. This decision will not be precedent setting. Should the implementation of minimum days<br/>authorized under this section result in the District failing to meet the State funding requirement<br/>for minimal instructional times, such minimum days shall not be instituted.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise level at extra-curricular dances and assemblies, in which amplified electronic<br/>equipment is used, shall not be continuously in excess of the &quot;safe&quot; range established by the<br/>California Occupational Safety and Health Agency, as marked on the district decibel meter based</p>
<p>on the number of hours of activity. Measurement shall be taken in the middle of the crowd.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>Should an excess occur, the school administrator shall take the necessary steps to reduce the<br/>decibels to the &quot;safe&quot; range. &quot;Continuously&quot; shall be defined as noise in excess of safe levels for<br/>a period of 15 seconds or more.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Board of Education policy, Yucaipa-Calimesa School District provides its<br/>employees a tobacco-free work place. Use of tobacco is prohibited in buildings, on grounds, and<br/>in district vehicles.</p>
<p>7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and District shall meet and consult on the topic of job-related stress,<br/>causes, and possible strategies for reduction.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8: CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>8.1 General</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Education desires to reduce class sizes where appropriate and will<br/>explore ways to accomplish this goal in view of financial and class facility availability.</p>
<p>8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these constraints, class size shall be determined by the district<br/>superintendent and in accordance with provisions of the Education Code and Title 5 of the<br/>California Administrative Code.</p>
<p>8.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following classroom student-teacher maximums are agreed to as guidelines<br/>for establishing reasonable class sizes:</p>
<p>Class size maximums &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students: 1 teacher*</p>
<p>4-6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35 students: 1 teacher</p>
<p>7-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36 students: 1 teacher</p>
<p>Secondary classrooms with peninsular science, laboratory workstations or computer<br/>workstations: the student capacity for which the workstations were designed to accommodate.</p>
<p>* Subject to change based on state guidelines, pending current funding levels and availability of<br/>facilities.</p>
<p>8.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are exceptions to the class size maximums in Article 8.1.2.1:</p>
<p>K-3 PE - maximum of 32 students per 1 adult;</p>
<p>A maximum of 80 students per certificated<br/>physical education teacher<br/>4-6 PE - maximum of 35 students per 1 adult; a<br/>maximum of 80 students per certificated<br/>physical education teacher.</p>
<p>4-6 Music</p>
<p>7-12 PE and athletics, technology, leadership,</p>
<p>journalism, performing arts (music, band,</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>drama, etc.), yearbook, singleton classes.</p>
<p>8.1.2.3 The Association and the District will jointly establish a standing committee to<br/>review specific class overloads. Either party may request the committee to convene after the<br/>affected unit members and principal have first attempted in good faith to resolve the class<br/>overload at the school site. The scheduling of the committee will be made by mutual agreement.<br/>An overload is established when a class is in excess of the guidelines as stated in section 8.1.2.1.<br/>Committee members will include two (2) Y-CEA members appointed by the Association; the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources; and the Assistant Superintendent, Educational<br/>Services or their designee. The Standing Committee shall not meet earlier than two (2) weeks<br/>after the start of the last track in multi-track schools and one (1) week for single-track and<br/>traditional schools. The site principal or administrative designee and building representative<br/>may elect to participate in an ad hoc, non-voting capacity. Any member of the committee may<br/>request a resource person (i.e., parents, students, principals, and/or other community members).<br/>The committee shall review the reasons for class size overloads and the alternatives available to<br/>alleviate the situation. The committee will then make recommendations to the Superintendent or<br/>designee for action. The committee will jointly develop a format for the reporting of cases<br/>reviewed and recommendations to the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall state in writing his/her decision(s) and send copies to the<br/>Association, the principal of the affected school site and the teacher(s) involved.</p>
<p>8.2 Elementary</p>
<p>8.2.1 Because of financial and facility limitations as well as the requirement for flexibility<br/>in providing sound program design, the Board of Education reserves the right to increase or<br/>decrease class sizes at any school or classroom location. Nevertheless, the Board of Education<br/>recognizes that instructional effectiveness is diminished after regular classroom size in grades K-<br/>5 exceeds thirty (30) students.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district will consider educationally sound options to maintain equitable class<br/>sizes within grade levels on an intraschool basis, and upon request, provide the Unit Member<br/>with a written rationale for student allocation decisions. Equity in this section shall be defined to<br/>mean a difference of three (3) students between the largest and smallest classes on any given<br/>grade level, except where efforts are made to lower class size for teachers who have been<br/>assigned students certified for any special needs program. The District will maintain a growth<br/>track at year-round, multi-track schools that may not meet the aforementioned criteria. If a<br/>school site experiences enrollment changes, more than one growth track may exist. When<br/>additional growth tracks are needed, the Superintendent/designee will discuss this need with the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district will make every effort, where possible, to provide lower class sizes for<br/>combination classes when compared with class sizes of single grade level of the same grades<br/>involved in the combination class at the site.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership teams and department chairpersons at the middle, junior high school<br/>level and high school will be consulted when feasible by the appropriate school supervisor on the<br/>disposition of individual class sizes within their respective departments when the average class<br/>size meets or exceeds the ratio of 36 to 1 or where a need for special facilities exists.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more than one section of the same class exists in the same department, the<br/>district will consider educationally sound options to maintain equitable class sizes and upon<br/>request provide the unit member with a written rationale for student allocation decisions. Equity<br/>in this section shall be defined to mean a difference of five (5) students between the largest and<br/>smallest sections of the same class in the same department, except where efforts are made to<br/>lower class size for teachers who have been assigned students certified for any special needs<br/>program.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Students</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>8.4.1 Elementary</p>
<p>In assigning students to teachers, principals shall give consideration to lower class sizes for<br/>teachers who have been assigned students certified for special needs programs. The District<br/>shall equalize where possible the distribution on an intraschool basis within the same grade level<br/>or where more than one section of a class exists of students who are certified as special needs<br/>students.</p>
<p>8.4.2 Secondary</p>
<p>In assigning students certified for special needs programs to teachers, principals shall give<br/>consideration to lower class sizes for those sections containing students certified for the special<br/>needs program and other mutually agreed upon students any special needs program.</p>
<p>8.5 Specialists</p>
<p>Staffing for Specialists (psychologists, counselors, and speech therapists) shall be consistent with<br/>current district prioritization, subject to enrollment changes, and district needs.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 9: LEAVE PROVISIONS</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits which are expressly provided by this section. Article 9, are the sole benefits<br/>which are part of this collective agreement, and it is agreed that permissive statutory or<br/>regulatory leave benefits are not incorporated either directly or impliedly in this Agreement.<br/>Normal verification of proper use of leave shall be the indication of the type of leave used and<br/>the signing of a District-provided form. In the event there exists sufficient reason, as determined<br/>by management, to suspect abuse of leave provisions, the District may require further<br/>verification of the legitimate use of such leave.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Illness and Injury Leave</p>
<p>9.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time unit members shall be entitled to ten (10) days leave with full pay for each<br/>school year for purposes of personal illness or injury. Unit members who work less than full<br/>time shall be entitled to that portion of the ten (10) days leave as the number of hours per week<br/>of scheduled duty relates to the number of hours for a full-time unit member in a comparable<br/>position.</p>
<p>9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all earned leave as set forth in 9.2.1 above is exhausted, additional leave<br/>benefits shall be available for a period, not to exceed five (5) school months, provided that the<br/>provisions of 9.2.4 below are met. The amount deducted for leave purposes from the unit<br/>member's salary shall be the amount actually paid a substitute employee employed to fill the<br/>position during the leave or, if no substitute is employed, the amount which would have been<br/>paid to substitute. The five (5) month period shall begin immediately after exhaustion of the unit<br/>member's entitlement to current and accumulated sick leave. An employee shall not be provided<br/>more than one five-month period per illness or accident. However, if a school year terminates<br/>before the five-month period is exhausted, the employee may take the balance of the five-month<br/>period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>9.2.3 If a unit member does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in 9.2.1 above<br/>in any school year, the amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>9.2.4 Upon request by District management, a unit member shall be required to present a<br/>medical doctor's certificate verifying absences for personal illness or injury. However, the<br/>District shall not require such medical verification unless there exists sufficient reason, as<br/>determined by management, to suspect an abuse of sick leave.</p>
<p>9.2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the illness or injury exceeds ten (10) consecutive days the District may<br/>require, at District expense, a unit member to visit a certified medical specialist who shall make<br/>all necessary inquiries in order to be fully informed as to the nature and severity of the illness or<br/>injury, and to report such findings to the superintendent or designee. If the report concludes that<br/>the absence is not due to personal illness or injury, or that the illness is not sufficiently severe to<br/>warrant continued absence, then the Superintendent or designee, after notice to the unit member,<br/>may refuse to grant such leave. The medical examination to return to work shall be at District<br/>expense when the District management selects the medical doctor.</p>
<p>9.2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If requested by the District management, a unit member shall not return to work<br/>until he/she submits a medical doctor's authorization to return to work. When the District selects<br/>the medical doctor for examination to determine the unit member's fitness to return to work, the<br/>unit member to be examined shall be offered a choice of one of three medical doctors.</p>
<p>9.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit member shall contact his/her immediate supervisor or<br/>his/her designee as soon as the need to be absent is known, no later than one and one-half hour<br/>prior to the workday, to permit the employer time to secure a substitute's service. Failure to<br/>provide adequate notice may be grounds for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>9.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is absent for less than a full day shall be charged for no less than<br/>one (1) hour of sick leave. For purposes of sick leave records, a unit member who is absent any<br/>portion of an hour will be charged 1/6 of a day's sick leave; between one (1) and two (2) hours,<br/>2/6; between two (2) and three (3) hours, 3/6; between three (3) and four (4) hours, 4/6; between<br/>four (4) and five (5) hours, 5/6; between five (5) and six (6) hours, a full day.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>9.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall notify the District of his/her intent to return to work at least one</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour prior to the start of the workday. In the event a unit member, without good reason as<br/>determined by management, fails to give such notice, he/she may be liable for the cost of a one-<br/>half day substitute unless the substitute can otherwise be utilized in a classroom situation which<br/>requires the services of a substitute teacher.</p>
<p>9.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) days of accumulated sick leave may be utilized by a unit member in<br/>addition to that allowed under Article 9.3.2 in the event that the unit member's presence is<br/>required for the care of the unit member's dependent s) necessitated by serious illness or injury.</p>

<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of 9.3.2, unit members shall be permitted to use two</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days of personal necessity each school year so long as such absence is not directly or<br/>indirectly related to considering, planning or engaging in illegal work stoppages or slowdowns.<br/>Members of the unit may not take leave authorized under this section during the first and last two<br/>(2) teaching days of each semester/trimester/term.</p>

Such verification shall contain a statement assuring that any personal necessity<br/>leave use was not related to a work stoppage or slowdown.</p>
<p>9.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to assure the efficient operation of the school district, a limit of 3% of<br/>all unit members shall be permitted to utilize personal necessity under section 9.3.3 on any given<br/>day. This limit may be exceeded at the discretion of the superintendent/designee.</p>
<p>9.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the utilization of personal necessity leave, a unit member must obtain prior<br/>written approval from the appropriate management person except in cases of (a) and (b) in<br/>section 9.3.2 above. Should the circumstances outlined in (a) and (b) arise, the employee shall<br/>make every reasonable effort to comply with District procedures to enable the District to secure a<br/>substitute.</p>
<p>9.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all circumstances a unit member shall verify in writing that the personal<br/>necessity leave was used only for purposes as set forth in 9.3.2 and 9.3.3 above.</p>
<p>9.4 Personal Business Leave</p>

Bargaining unit members who suffer a<br/>catastrophic injury/illness that is expected to incapacitate the unit member for an extended period<br/>of time (in excess of ten (10) days), shall become eligible to use this catastrophic sick leave plan<br/>subject to the restrictions and conditions outlined below:</p>
<p>9.13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member to receive donated sick leave must have exhausted all fully<br/>paid leave and must be in a true catastrophic condition.</p>
<p>9.13.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a catastrophic illness as defined in 9.13.1 above, the following<br/>options shall be utilized in the following order: (1) unit member's accumulated sick leave; (2)<br/>authorized catastrophic leave; (3) five (5) months differential leave; and (4) thirty-nine (39)<br/>months reemployment list.</p>
<p>9.13.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must be a permanent, not probationary, employee.</p>
<p>9.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of this Sick Leave Bank shall only be available to those eligible bargaining<br/>unit members who have made a donation of at least three (3) days to the Bank prior to their<br/>request, and have continued participation under Section 9.13.5.</p>

<p>Sick Leave Bank Request for Withdrawal Form.&quot; This form shall be submitted to the Human</p>
<p>Resources Office. The request shall clearly state the details of the catastrophe and the amount of</p>
<p>IQ</p>
<p>sick leave requested. Appropriate written verification of the catastrophic illness or injury must<br/>be included with the request. The unit member should be prepared to provide additional<br/>documentation on the nature and severity of the illness or injury, if requested. A Sick Leave<br/>Bank Committee shall consider the request of the unit member. The committee shall consist of<br/>one (1) person selected by the Employer as a record keeper and three (3) other members selected<br/>by the Association. The committee may grant, reject or partially grant a request. Approval shall<br/>require a majority vote of the Association members. Any rejection of a request may be appealed<br/>to the Y-CEA Executive Board for final action and decision. The timelines for filing an appeal<br/>shall be twenty (20) working days following the receipt of the decision of the committee.</p>
<p>9.13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of duty days allowed to be utilized by one unit member for<br/>a single catastrophic injury/illness shall not exceed thirty (30) duty days. A unit member may<br/>request a specific number of days on one &quot;Certificated Sick Leave Bank Request for Withdrawal<br/>Form.&quot; The unit member may request additional days up to the thirty (30) days by filing an<br/>additional request for consideration by the Committee.</p>
<p>9.13.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any days approved that are unused by the unit member shall be returned to the<br/>Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank.</p>
<p>9.13.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member uses a day from the Sick Leave Bank, pay for that day shall be<br/>the same rate the unit member would have received had the unit member worked that day. No<br/>distinction shall be made as to the differing pay rates of the donors or recipients.</p>
<p>9.13.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During September of each year, the Payroll Office shall provide the Association a<br/>statement outlining the number of days available in the Bank as of September 1 of that year and<br/>the number of days used in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>9.13.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold Harmless</p>
<p>The Association agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf or on behalf of any unit member,</p>
<p>any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind related to any attempt by a unit member to retrieve</p>
<p>donated sick leave used by another unit member pursuant to this provision. The Association also</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf or on behalf of any unit member, any grievance,<br/>claim or lawsuit of any kind which attempts to challenge in any way the legality or enforcement<br/>of this provision.</p>
<p>The Association agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the District from any loss or<br/>damages arising from the implementation of this provision. In the event of any grievance, claim<br/>or lawsuit challenging the legality or enforcement of this provision, the District may terminate<br/>this provision upon discussion and written notice to the Association.</p>
<p>9.13.16 If the Sick Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the<br/>Bank shall be equitably distributed to the then current members of the Bank.</p>

<p>40</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12: COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS</p>
<p>12.1 Unit members will be paid according to the attached Appendix A: Certificated Employees<br/>Salary Schedule. Unit members on a part-time teaching assignment shall be paid a proration of their<br/>placement on the regular salary schedule on the basis of the number of periods taught or hours taught<br/>at the elementary level.</p>
<p>12.2 In addition, the District will provide for the employee and family major medical insurance,<br/>health and prescription insurance, vision insurance, and dental insurance. The District shall provide a<br/>$25,000 term-life insurance policy for each full-time employee. See Appendix A-6 for other available<br/>coverage.</p>
<p>12.2.1 Health Benefits</p>
<p>The District shall increase the maximum annual District contribution for total health benefits including<br/>medical, dental, vision and life insurance for full-time eligible unit members up to $10,184 effective<br/>January 1, 2013. Costs in excess of this District maximum annual contribution shall be paid by unit<br/>members through payroll deduction pending any change agreed to between YCEA and the District in<br/>negotiations in accordance with Article 12 of the collective bargaining agreement. Beginning January<br/>1, 2013, eligible unit members shall participate in a three tier rate structure for medical coverage<br/>consisting of Single, Two Party, and Family for the United Health Care HMO, United Health Care<br/>PPO, Choice Plus and Kaiser Plans. The three tier structure shall be in effect through December 31,<br/>2013 and thereafter shall continue as the status quo subject to modification through the annual meet<br/>and negotiation process.</p>
<p>The District shall also allocate a one-time amount equal to $180,000 to be applied toward the above<br/>three tier rate structure for unit members participating in the UHC HMO plan as mutually agreed to<br/>between the District and the Association to help mitigate the out of pocket costs. This one-time<br/>allocation shall be in effect beginning January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013.</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit and the District agree that the salaries and benefits of employees<br/>of the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District are paid on a total compensation concept.<br/>Under the total compensation concept, total compensation is figured as follows:</p>
<p>Salaries plus the cost of health and welfare benefits as outlined in Section 12.2 above is equal to total<br/>compensation for employees. The cost of health and welfare benefits is that contribution amount<br/>which is the annual maximum district contribution for any plan year per eligible employee for district<br/>approved health benefits. In cases where such district maximum contribution for health and welfare<br/>benefits per eligible employee is less than the prior maximum district health benefit contribution the<br/>total difference will be applied towards a salary schedule increase. In cases where the cost of the<br/>maximum district contribution for health and welfare benefits costs increases, the bargaining unit and<br/>the District shall meet and negotiate those health and welfare cost increases. These increased costs<br/>shall be addressed through one or/any combination of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reduction in monies available for a salary schedule increase.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plan design change that would maintain the current cost of health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee contribution for health and welfare benefits in order to maintain current health<br/>and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increase in District contribution rate to health and welfare benefits; or</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other mutually agreed upon solution.</p>
<p>12.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee recommendations for rates and plan designs for the following year will be<br/>presented to the Board of Education and Association no later than May 1 of each year. Upon receipt<br/>of information which indicates that a change in health benefits cost is necessary, the Association will<br/>notify the District and negotiations shall immediately commence related to approaches which shall be<br/>followed as outlined above.</p>
<p>12.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Benefits Committee shall make meetings for the purpose of making<br/>recommendations on health benefits to the District and the Association. All decisions affecting health</p>
<p>si</p>
<p>benefits shall be subject to negotiations between the District and the Association with final approval<br/>by the Board of Education.</p>
<p>12.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the District contribution does not cover the cost of health benefits, the<br/>Association and District cannot reach agreement on options a - e in Article 12.2.2, and the health<br/>benefits reserve has been depleted, then &quot;COLA&quot; monies will be used to address funding prior to any<br/>other use.</p>
<p>12.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations made by the health benefit committee related to plan design and<br/>funding are advisory to the Board of Education and the Association's board of directors.<br/>Recommendations will be referred to the Board of Education and respective bargaining units'<br/>negotiating committees.</p>
<p>12.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association may mutually agree to a change in carrier for District-<br/>sponsored health and welfare coverage.</p>
<p>12.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time employees employed fifty percent (50%) or more of full time shall receive<br/>the same health and welfare benefits as a full-time employee only if the part-time employee<br/>reimburses the District the difference between the employee's prorata share and the District's<br/>contribution of the health and welfare benefits. Part-time unit members who do not reimburse the<br/>District as described above shall receive neither the benefits nor compensation in lieu of the benefits.<br/>The employee's prorata share shall be based upon the number of periods taught per day or hours<br/>taught at the elementary level. Part-time employees employed less than fifty percent (50%) of full<br/>time shall not be eligible to participate in this program.</p>
<p>12.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All recommendations of the Health Benefits Committee require the approval of the<br/>Board of Education.</p>
<p>12.3 Replacing or Repairing Employee Property</p>
<p>The District will provide for the payment of the cost of replacing or repairing specifically defined<br/>personal property of the employee under specifically defined circumstances. Such payment will be<br/>confined to an amount in excess of any amount for which the employee may be insured, and will be</p>
<p>paid only after the employee has sought payment from any carrier with which he/she may be insured.<br/>The specific personal property eligible for the cost of replacement or repair is defined as eyeglasses,<br/>hearing aids, dentures, watches, articles of clothing commonly worn or carried by the employee, and<br/>vehicles. Certain personal property used by the District may be eligible for reimbursement or<br/>replacement based on procedures as outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property must be used in the line of duty which shall mean attendance at an assigned<br/>work site of the District or other site when performing professional duties or at any official function of<br/>the District. An inventory of personal property used by employees for instructional purposes shall be<br/>filed with and approved by the appropriate supervisor prior to classroom use. The form for this<br/>inventory shall be made available to all employees. In the case of vehicles, an employee using his/her<br/>vehicle under special assignment of a regular nature to conduct District business for which a District<br/>vehicle is not provided must obtain prior written approval of the immediate supervisor. Such approval<br/>shall specify the identification of the vehicle, the insurance carrier, and a general statement of the<br/>condition of the vehicle. Forms for this purpose shall be available and accessible upon assignment.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property to be eligible for the cost of replacement or repair must have been damaged or<br/>destroyed in the line of duty or must have been stolen by theft or robbery. If the District determines<br/>that the damage has been wholly or partly caused by the employee's lack of care of failure to apply<br/>generally accepted methods of protection, no reimbursement need be made by the District. In the<br/>event the employee is paid the costs of replacing or repairing such property, or the actual value of such<br/>property, the District shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to any right of the employee<br/>to recover compensation for such damaged or stolen property. The District may file and prosecute an<br/>action to enforce its subrogation right in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>PROCEDURES FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE OF PERSONAL<br/>PROPERTY</p>
<p>Adequate Proof: The business manager of the District shall investigate the matter to determine in his<br/>best judgment whether the loss or damage to the personal property of the employee occurred while the</p>
<p>employee was engaged in his/her line of duty. Adequate proof of the property loss or damage shall be<br/>established by clear and convincing evidence. In the instances of vehicles, there shall be clear and<br/>convincing evidence of loss or damage through arson or vandalism or loss or damage by theft or<br/>robbery. If the item of personal property is damaged, stolen or vandalized, the value of such property<br/>to a maximum of $500 and a minimum of $25.00, per loss, nor of more than $500 maximum per<br/>incident will be paid whether the District pays the cost. The employee, when appropriate, must file a<br/>report with the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction The value of the property shall be<br/>determined as of the time of damage thereto or the theft or robbery.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be reimbursed at a rate equal to the Internal Revenue Service allowance<br/>when authorized and requested, in advance, by management to use their personal vehicles in the<br/>performance of their duties.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary student supervision outside the regular instructional day shall be compensated as<br/>set forth in Appendix A-5.</p>
