If the District makes<br/>every reasonable effort to secure a substitute and is unsuccessful, the rate<br/>that would have been paid to the substitute may be deducted from the<br/>absent employee’s wages. In neither case shall an employee receive less<br/>than fifty dollars ($50.00) per day.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may transfer accumulated sick leave according to the<br/>provision of Education Code Section 44979.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary, probationary, and permanent employees will be evaluated<br/>each year (note n.). If the site administrator decides, based upon<br/>continually demonstrated satisfactory performance, to not evaluate a<br/>permanent employee under normal contract procedures in two<br/>consecutive years, he/she and the employee may mutually agree upon an<br/>alternative evaluation procedure which shall be documented. If the site<br/>administrator and employee do not mutually agree upon an alternative<br/>evaluation procedure, the site administrator will initiate the contract’s<br/>normal evaluation process.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations shall be based on classroom visitations and upon such other<br/>areas as affect the operation and welfare of the total education program.<br/>Evaluation reports shall be based upon classroom visitation forms and<br/>such other interim reports made by the evaluator and compiled in the<br/>employee’s personnel file.

Nothing<br/>herein shall prevent the District from requiring an employee to perform all<br/>duties and responsibilities of the position to which he/she is assigned.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are required to sign all evaluations. An employee does not<br/>sign that he/she agrees with the evaluation but rather that he/she has<br/>seen it. Each employee is to receive a copy of the evaluation.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request a conference with the evaluator and the<br/>Superintendent when there is an unsatisfactory evaluation. The<br/>conference shall be of sufficient length for each party to thoroughly review<br/>their respective positions.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If less than satisfactory performance is noted in any written performance<br/>observation report, the evaluator will provide written suggestions to the<br/>employee designed to assist the employee to improve his/her<br/>performance.

If the final evaluation ratings are not agreed upon by all<br/>evaluators, their differences will be noted on the final evaluation.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summative Evaluation Form (Appendix J) will reflect the California<br/>Standards For Teaching Profession (CSTP) Standards-Based evaluation<br/>format.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A three (3) year evaluation cycle shall be established for permanent ALE<br/>members who meet the following criteria:</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVI<br/>JOB SHARING</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Teaching Assignments</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee may authorize two (2) teachers to share<br/>one (1) full time teaching assignment under terms and conditions specified<br/>in the collective bargaining agreement. Shared teaching assignments<br/>may be considered whenever such an arrangement will benefit students.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governing Board realizes that for personal reasons, a certified<br/>teacher sometimes may prefer to share the responsibility, salary, and<br/>benefits of a full-time teaching position with one of her/his fellow teachers.<br/>When those sharing a position have compatible work patterns and similar<br/>goals, this situation can benefit teachers and students alike. By<br/>accommodating requests for shared teaching assignments, the District is<br/>more likely to retain teachers of outstanding capabilities. The determining<br/>factor, however, in such assignments will be the potential benefit to the<br/>students involved.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent teachers shall submit their request in writing for such an<br/>assignment to the Superintendent or designee by March 1<sup>st</sup> of the<br/>preceding school year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers requesting a shared assignment shall be informed of the status<br/>of their proposal by June 1<sup>st</sup>. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall annually review the effectiveness of<br/>the shared teaching assignment and determine whether or not it may<br/>continue the following year. She/he shall notify the teacher of this<br/>decision on or before June 1<sup>sl</sup> of each year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours and Responsibilities</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teachers shall meet with the principal before school opens to<br/>establish exact working days and meeting responsibilities. Although the<br/>teacher not on duty will normally be required to attend staff meetings, both<br/>teachers shall attend parent/guardian conferences, open house, and back-<br/>to-school nights. Both teachers also may be expected to attend specific<br/>inservice meetings and work the first two (2) days of school.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teachers shall assume full responsibility for the class instructional<br/>program. They will regularly meet to jointly develop lesson plans and<br/>ensure clear lines of communication with parents/guardians.</p>
<p>16-1</p>
<p>Revised July 2012</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall approve the teachers’ working calendar before school<br/>opens.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calendar will be developed with the students’ educational program as<br/>the number one priority.</p>
<p>Salary, Leaves, and Absences</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher will receive the proportional amount of annual salary<br/>according to individual placement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s and the District’s contribution to the retirement system<br/>shall be proportional to the amount paid. If an employee works one<br/>hundred thirty-five (135) partial or full days in a school year, the teacher<br/>will receive a year of service credit toward advancement on the salary<br/>schedule. If a teacher completes a year’s work at half time the teacher will<br/>receive one-half year of service towards advancement on the salary<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever one of the teachers sharing an assignment is absent, including<br/>extended leaves, the other teacher sharing the assignment shall make<br/>every reasonable effort to perform substitute teaching duties. Unless a<br/>trade off of work days is approved, the teacher shall be paid at the current<br/>substitute rate.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers sharing an assignment shall accrue sick leave and other leave<br/>benefits proportional to the amount of service days. Worker compensation<br/>insurance shall be paid on the employee’s actual salary.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health benefits shall be provided as per the current collective bargaining<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the first year of participation, teachers shall request a part-time<br/>leave of absence from their full-time teaching position.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers electing to continue in the job share program beyond the first<br/>year shall, as a condition of continuing in the program, resign whatever<br/>percentage of their full-time position that is not necessary for their<br/>continued employment as a part-time employee under this program. This<br/>will not affect the seniority of the participants.</p>

<p>Returning to Full-Time Status</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one or both job share teachers, who are permanent, want to return to<br/>full-time (and had previously worked full-time in the District), they shall<br/>notify the Superintendent or designee by March 1<sup>st</sup> of the year prior to<br/>return.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon dissolution of the job share, the initiating teacher shall return to<br/>his/her original position.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining teacher shall be reassigned to the position she/he left if the<br/>position is vacant or filled by a teacher on a temporary contract. If the<br/>position is not vacant or filled by a temporary teacher, the remaining<br/>teacher shall be reassigned or transferred in accordance with the transfer<br/>procedure set forth in this contract. However, in no case shall the<br/>remaining teacher have priority over a full time teacher who has equal or<br/>greater years of full time seniority.</p>
<p>6. Definitions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiating Teacher: The teacher requesting the job share.</p>

<p>A “grievance” is an allegation by the Association or by one or more employees<br/>that there has been a violation or improper interpretation of the terms and<br/>provisions of this Agreement. A grievance shall not extend to any written or<br/>unwritten law, policy, rule, regulation, procedure, practice, order, directive or<br/>similar type item.</p>
<p>3. Informal Resolution of Problem:</p>
<p>Informal discussion of problems and a continuing interchange of views between</p>
<p>employees and their immediate supervisors is encouraged. Supervisors should</p>
<p>attempt to resolve differences or dissatisfactions as soon as possible.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) days of the employee having knowledge, or should have<br/>had knowledge, of the event giving rise to a possible grievance, the<br/>employee shall request a conference with the immediate supervisor to<br/>discuss the possible grievance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisors shall grant the employees at least one conference within ten<br/>(10) working days of receipt of the request.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional conferences should be held, prior to initiation of Step 1 if it<br/>appears that resolution of the complaint may be achieved by informal<br/>means.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the complainant and the supervisor may invite other persons, which<br/>may include a representative or representatives of the Association, to<br/>attend these conferences.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, it is expected that the immediate supervisor will provide<br/>a verbal or written decision upon request to the aggrieved employee within<br/>five (5) working days of any discussion.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is incapacitated, applications may be submitted to the<br/>Committee by the participant’s agent or member of the unit member’s<br/>family.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of<br/>no more than thirty (30) duty days. Unit members may submit requests<br/>for extensions of withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A unit member’s<br/>withdrawal from the bank may not exceed the number of contract days<br/>remaining in the current school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank will be required to submit a doctor’s statement<br/>indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the probable length of<br/>absence from work.

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has drawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank days and<br/>requests an extension, the Committee may require a medical review by a<br/>physician specialized in the illness/injury. Refusal to submit to the<br/>medical review by a physician specialized in the illness/injury will<br/>terminate the unit member’s continued withdrawal from the Bank. The<br/>Committee may deny an extension of withdrawal from the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank based upon the medical report.</p>
