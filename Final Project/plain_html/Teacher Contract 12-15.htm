<p>each school year for purposes of personal illness or injury. Employees who work<br/>less than full time shall be entitled to such proportion of the ten (10) days leave as<br/>the number of hours per week scheduled duty bears to the number of hours for a<br/>full-time employee in a comparable position.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in<br/>Paragraph 1 above, in any school year, the amount not utilized shall be<br/>accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee may require additional written verification by the<br/>employee’s physician or practitioner. Such verification shall be required<br/>whenever an employee’s absence record shows chronic absenteeism or a pattern<br/>of absences immediately before or after weekends and/or holidays or whenever<br/>clear evidence indicates that an absence is not related to illness or injury.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reasonable cause, the Superintendent or designee may require an employee<br/>to visit a physician jointly selected by the District and unit member at District<br/>expense in order to receive a report on the medical condition of the employee. If<br/>no agreement is reached the employee may select a physician from a list provided<br/>by the Redwood Empire School’s Insurance Group (RESIG). The report shall<br/>include a statement as to the employee’s need for further leave of absence and a<br/>prognosis for when the employee will be able to return to work.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to work, an employee who has been absent for surgery,<br/>hospitalization or extended medical treatment may be asked to submit a letter<br/>from his/her physician stating that he/she is able to return and stipulating any<br/>recommended restrictions or limitations.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, an employee must contact the District Office by 5:00 p.m., or<br/>earlier on the day prior to the absence, if the need to be absent is known, to permit<br/>the District time to secure substitute service. Insofar as possible, an employee<br/>taking sick leave shall notify the District of the intent to return to work no later<br/>than 2:00 p.m. on the day preceding such intended return.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an absence results in a substitute being secured, a full or half day (3 Vi<br/>hours or less) shall be deducted from sick leave. At the discretion of the District,<br/>allowances may be made for unforeseen emergencies, such as serious illness or<br/>accident involving the employee or immediate family.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month period shall<br/>run consecutively.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be provided more than one five-month period per illness or<br/>accident. However, if the school year ends before the five-month period is<br/>exhausted, the employee may take the balance of the five-month period in a<br/>subsequent school year.</p>

<p>(10) days of accrued sick leave each school year for any of the following:</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious illness of a member of the employee’s immediate family.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving the employee’s property or property of any member<br/>of the employees’ immediate family.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imminent danger to the home of an employee occasioned by an event such<br/>as flood or fire, serious in nature, and which under the circumstances the<br/>member cannot reasonably be expected to disregard and which requires<br/>the attention of the employee during assigned hours of service.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity leave may be granted for other emergencies and events,<br/>serious in nature, which may occur, which under the circumstances the<br/>employee cannot reasonably be expected to disregard and which requires<br/>the attention of the employee during assigned hours of service. However,<br/>no such leave shall be granted for purposes of personal convenience, for<br/>the extension of a holiday or vacation, or for matters which can be taken<br/>care of outside of working hours. The Superintendent or designee shall<br/>have final discretion as to whether a request reflects true personal<br/>necessity.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the conditions in g. above, employees may take up to five (5)<br/>days of personal necessity leave per year without the prior approval of the<br/>Superintendent.</p>

<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After any absence due to personal necessity, the employee shall verify the<br/>absence by submitting a completed and signed District absence form to<br/>his/her immediate supervisor.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall start on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be paid such portion of the salary due for any month<br/>in which the absence occurs as, when, added to the temporary disability<br/>indemnity under Division 4 or 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a<br/>payment to the employee of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each<br/>day of authorized absence, regardless of a temporary disability indemnity<br/>award.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>d. When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal<br/>year, the employee is entitled to only the amount of unused leave due the<br/>employee for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon expiration of allowable leave for an industrial accident or illness, the<br/>employee may use personal illness and injury leave. If the employee continues to<br/>receive temporary disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much of the<br/>accumulated sick leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability<br/>indemnity, will result in a payment to the employee of not more than the<br/>employee’s full salary.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the employee may endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of his/her industrial<br/>accident or illness. In those cases, the District shall issue appropriate salary<br/>warrants for payment of the employee’s salary, and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement, other authorized contributions, and the temporary disability indemnity,<br/>if any, actually paid to and retained by the employee for periods covered by such<br/>salary warrants.</p>

No unit member may utilize more than two (2) months of transferred<br/>sick leave per school year.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI. JOB SHARING</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job Sharing is a plan whereby two unit members share the full responsibility for one self-<br/>contained full-time position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job share application will specify the benefits to the District and the students as well<br/>as the benefits to the unit members involved. The written application will indicate the<br/>name(s) of the unit members who are proposing to job share and it will indicate how the<br/>unit members plan to implement the job share position. The application must show<br/>details of how the unit members intend to coordinate their work, insuring that the<br/>educational continuity of the class will be preserved.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who wish to apply for a job share arrangement shall do so by March 1<sup>st</sup> of</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>the school year prior to the intended job share. The District exclusively reserves the right<br/>of approval. The District may, after March 1<sup>st</sup>, accept late job share applications that are<br/>judged to be in the best interest of the pupils and programs of the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members wishing to participate in a job share shall apply to the Superintendent/<br/>Principal. At least one of the parties to a job share application must be a permanent unit<br/>member. Approval of job share requests shall be determined by an assessment of the<br/>proposal, meeting the needs of the students as well as those of the unit members.<br/>Approval of a job share request shall also be determined by the District’s ability to obtain<br/>a suitable replacement for the vacancy created by the job share, should it be necessary to<br/>fill said vacancy.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing contracts shall be one (1) year in length. Job share contracts shall be based<br/>on a .8 and .2 split of a full-time position. Unit members must annually submit a request<br/>to job share. The approved application shall be binding on the parties, unless mutually<br/>agreed upon by the unit members and the district.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities for an assignment of two (2) job sharers may be divided or allocated<br/>according to the plan designed by the job sharers with the concurrence of the<br/>Superintendent/Principal. It is the intent that job sharers fulfill their instructional duties<br/>based on the proration of their employment contract. However, it is understood that the<br/>coordination of the classroom activities and instruction between the job sharers will<br/>likely require more time than if a single unit member was responsible for the class. In<br/>addition, each job sharer shall attend a prorated share of the faculty meetings and grade<br/>level meetings (if applicable). Both unit members shall attend regularly scheduled parent<br/>conferences. Both unit members will attend back-to-school nights and open-house<br/>nights.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each job sharing unit member is responsible for notifying the District when a substitute<br/>is needed. The teaching team partner is entitled to first call for substitute service. The job<br/>share partners may “cover for each other” rather than calling for a substitute.</p>
<p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who has been approved for a job share will be granted a leave of absence,</p>
<p>if necessary, for the portion of the assignment he/she is not working.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that one of the two job sharing unit members is unable to fulfill the terms of<br/>the job share contract the remaining job sharing unit member shall have the options of:</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;converting to full-time employment in that position, or</p>
<p>9.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuing the j ob share with another qualified teacher. If this teacher is not a<br/>current unit member, the regular hiring protocol will be used.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of temporary certificated personnel must be agreeable to the District and unit<br/>member or else the job share will not be honored utilizing temporary certificated<br/>personnel.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Job Sharing Requirements:</p>
<p>There shall be no increase in cost to the District for salary or benefits beyond the<br/>cost that would be incurred for a single employee.</p>
<p>Salaries shall be prorated for part-time contracts in proportion to the amount that<br/>the approved portion of employment bears to full-time employment.</p>
<p>Fringe benefits shall be provided to the employee working 100%. If an employee<br/>works between 60% and 100% the benefits will be prorated. No benefits will be<br/>offered to employees working less than 60%.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII. BENEFITS</p>
<p>Employees shall be entitled to receive benefits in accordance with Appendix “B”.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII. SAFETY</p>
<p>A. Safe Working Conditions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make a reasonable effort to maintain safe and healthy working<br/>conditions so that teachers shall not be required to perform tasks that endanger<br/>their health, safety, or well being.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are required to report to the Administrator in writing conditions, which<br/>they feel are hazardous or unsafe.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an annual basis, the District and Association shall establish a safety/discipline<br/>committee to review and revise the District safety/discipline policies. The<br/>committee shall be composed of not more than 10 people, which shall include 4<br/>association members. Once the plan is agreed upon it shall be published and<br/>distributed to all affected parties.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX. RETIREMENT</p>
<p>Subject to annual approval of the Board, based on the District’s financial condition, retirees may<br/>receive a cash payment equal to one half (1/2) their current placement on the salary schedule,<br/>according to the following stipulations:</p>
<p>Eligibility:</p>
<p>A. Have ten (10) or more years of service in the Liberty School District; and</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not less than age 55 on the effective date of their retirement or at least 30 years of<br/>service credit in STRS and be at least age 50 at the time of their retirement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualify for and take a service retirement with STRS.</p>
<p>Payment Schedule</p>
<p>Paid over a period two years. This money may be used to purchase District provided health and</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVIII. COMPLAINTS</p>
<p>A. In order to promote fair and constructive communication, the following procedures shall<br/>govern the resolution of complaints against bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort should be made to resolve a concern or complaint at the earliest<br/>possible stage. Concerns or complaints regarding school personnel are to be<br/>made directly by the complainant to the person against whom the complaint is<br/>made within 20 work days from the time of the incident. Parents/guardians are<br/>required to orally address concerns with the staff member personally in a meeting<br/>or conference with the staff member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint or concern is not resolved at the first staff member and<br/>parent/guardian contact (above), a conference shall be called. Either the<br/>parent/guardian or staff member may request the presence of the District<br/>Administrator at the conference. However, if the complainant has not addressed<br/>the unit member, then the complainant will be directed by the Administrator to do<br/>so, before discussing the situation with the complainant.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complainant disagrees with the outcome of the conference, the case can be<br/>appealed to the Board of Trustees in writing.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complainant is unable to prepare the complaint in writing, administrative<br/>staff shall help him/her to do so. Complaints related to a Board member or the<br/>Superintendent shall be initially filed in writing with the Board.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written complaint must include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of each employee involved.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summary of the complaint and the facts surrounding it.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific description of any prior attempt to discuss the complaint with<br/>the employee and the failure to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person responsible for investigating complaints will attempt to resolve the<br/>complaint to the satisfaction of the person(s) involved within 30 days.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complainant may appeal a decision by the principal or immediate supervisor<br/>to the Superintendent or designee, who will attempt to resolve the complaint to</p>
<p>the satisfaction of the person(s) involved within 30 days. Complainants should<br/>consider and accept the Superintendent or designee’s decision as final. However,<br/>the complainant, the employee, or the Superintendent or designee may ask to<br/>address the Board regarding the complaint.</p>
<p>8. Before any Board consideration of a complaint, the Superintendent or designee<br/>shall submit to the Board a written report concerning the complaint, including but<br/>not limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of each employee involved.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summary of the complaint and the facts surrounding it,<br/>sufficient to inform the Board and the employee(s) as to the precise nature<br/>of the complaint and allow the employee(s) to prepare a defense.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the signed original complaint.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of the action taken by the Superintendent or designee, together<br/>with his/her specific finding that the problem has not been resolved and<br/>the reasons.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may uphold the Superintendents decision without hearing the<br/>complaint.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties to a complaint may be asked to attend a Board meeting in order to<br/>present all available evidence and allow every opportunity for explaining and<br/>clarifying the issue.</p>
<p>11. Before the Board holds a closed session to hear complaints or charges brought<br/>against an employee, the employee shall receive written notice of his/her right to<br/>have the complaints or charges heard in open session rather than closed session.<br/>This notice shall be delivered personally or by mail at least 24 hours before the<br/>time of the session, and the employee may request that the complaints or charges<br/>be heard in open session.</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>Complaints shall be addressed in open session unless a closed is warranted<br/>pursuant to Education Code 35146 or 48918 or Government Code 54957 or</p>
<p>54957.6.</p>
<p>13. Any decision of the Board shall be final.</p>
