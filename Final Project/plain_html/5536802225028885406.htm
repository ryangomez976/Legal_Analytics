<p>The Huntington Beach City School District</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Association</p>
<p>Huntington Beach City School District and Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Association<br/>mutually agree to enter into this Memorandum of Understanding and agree to the following:</p>
<p>Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) K-3 Grade Span Adjustment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Huntington Beach City School District (“District”) and Huntington Beach<br/>Elementary Teachers Association (“Association”) acknowledge that as a condition to receiving<br/>the augmentation funding for K-3 grade span adjustment under the Local Control Funding<br/>Formula (LCFF), the District is required to maintain an average class enrollment of not more<br/>than 24 pupils in grades K-3 at each school site upon full implementation of LCFF (currently<br/>2021) (Education Code section 42238.02(d)(3)(D)), unless the District and Association have<br/>negotiated an alternative annual average class enrollment for each school site (Education Code<br/>section 42238.02(d)(3)(B), (C), and (D)).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following represents the negotiated agreement between the District and<br/>Association concerning grade K-3 effective July 1, 2013:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District-wide average class size for grades K-3 shall not exceed 30:1<br/>with no individual K-3 class at any school site exceeding 32:1.</p>

<p>This Memorandum of Understanding shall be effective July 1, 2013, through June 30,<br/>2021. The Association and the District reserves the right to negotiate changes in paragraph two<br/>above during any school year covered by the term of this Memorandum.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>between</p>
<p>The Huntington Beach City School District</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Association</p>
<p>Huntington Beach City School District and Huntington Beach Elementary Teachers Association<br/>mutually agree to enter into this Memorandum of Understanding and agree to the following:</p>
<p>For the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years only, the District and Association shall jointly<br/>form a Kindergarten Instructional Day Sub-Committee. The Kindergarten Instructional Day Sub¬<br/>committee will include a maximum of four (4) representatives appointed by the Association and<br/>a maximum of four (4) administrators appointed by the District and shall be co-chaired by an<br/>Association and District appointed designee. The Association and the District shall appoint their<br/>representatives and designate their chairperson on or before May 15, 2014. During the 2013-14<br/>and 2014-2015 school years, the Kindergarten Instructional Day Sub-Committee shall meet<br/>when they deem necessary during the regular teacher workday. The District will bear the costs<br/>of all Association substitute coverage.

Many surrounding OC elementary school districts have an extended<br/>kindergarten day. The District asserts that the adoption of this contract language, which<br/>increases the kindergarten minutes, will result in increased kindergarten enrollment for all<br/>schools in the District.</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding shall be in effect for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school<br/>years only.</p>
