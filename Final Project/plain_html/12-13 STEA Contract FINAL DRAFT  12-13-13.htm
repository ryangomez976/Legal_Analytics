<p>effective while being fair to all parties concerned.</p>
<p>A. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance: A grievance is an allegation by the Association, or one or more Unit<br/>Members, that the District has taken an action or failed to take a required action,<br/>which misinterprets, misapplies, or violates a specific provision(s) of this Agreement.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant: A grievant is any Unit Member of the District covered by the terms of this<br/>Agreement who files a grievance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Party in Interest: A party in interest is an employee filing a grievance, or any<br/>employee against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the grievance, or<br/>the District.</p>

<p>11</p>
<p>B. PROCEDURAL STEPS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF A GRIEVANCE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1: Informal consultation with immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>a. An attempt shall be made to resolve the grievance by an informal conference<br/>between the Unit Member, if the Unit Member desires to be present, and an<br/>Association representative, if the Unit Member so desires such representation, and<br/>the immediate supervisor and his/her representative, should he/she desire one.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2: Immediate Supervisor/District Level Administrator</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, acting on behalf of the Unit Member, or the individual grievant, shall<br/>file the grievance in writing with the immediate supervisor not later than twenty (20)<br/>days after the Unit Member knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know,<br/>of the action or inaction that constituted the basis of the grievance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction of the District at a level above the<br/>principal or immediate supervisor, the grievant shall submit such grievance in writing<br/>directly to the District Level Administrator involved in the action.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance and the<br/>circumstance on which the grievance is based, including:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific grounds of the grievance, including names, dates, persons, and<br/>places necessary for a complete understanding of the grievance;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the specific provisions of this Agreement allegedly violated or<br/>misapplied;</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons why the solutions proposed in the informal conference are not<br/>acceptable, and;</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific actions requested to remedy the grievance.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting among the Unit Member (if the Unit Member desires to be present), an<br/>Association representative, the Unit Member’s immediate supervisor/District Level<br/>Administrator (and a representative should he/she wish one) shall be scheduled to<br/>discuss the grievance with the objective of resolving it. Such meeting shall be held<br/>not later than five (5) days after Step 2 was initiated.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not later than five (5) days after the conclusion of the Step 2 meeting, the immediate<br/>supervisor/District Level Administrator, shall provide the Unit Member and the<br/>Association with a written response.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant at Step 2, the<br/>grievant may file at Step 3 with the Superintendent not later than five (5) days after<br/>the receipt of the written response or fifteen (15) days after the filing at Step 2.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3: Superintendent</p>
<p>a. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall meet with the grievant and/or</p>
<p>designated Association representative within five (5) days of receipt of the grievance<br/>and shall provide a written response to the grievance, including the reasons<br/>therefore, to all parties of interest within five (5) days of such meeting, unless the<br/>Superintendent was involved in Step 2.</p>
<p>b. If a grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant at Step 3, the grievant<br/>may file at Step 4 with the Superintendent not later than five (5) days of receipt of the<br/>written response or twenty-five (25) days after the filing of the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 4: Grievance Resolution Committee</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days after receipt of the Superintendent’s written response, the<br/>Superintendent shall convene a meeting of the Grievance Resolution Committee.<br/>This committee shall comprise no more than three (3) representatives from the<br/>Association and three (3) from the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mutually agreed upon facilitator shall be appointed to the Grievance Resolution<br/>Committee, with the intent of assisting the Committee to reach consensus on a<br/>solution for resolving the grievance. Meetings of the Grievance Resolution<br/>Committee are to be conducted with the purpose of exploring the parties’ mutual and<br/>varied interests, creating options for resolution, and selecting the options that best<br/>meet the interests of the parties in resolving the grievance. It is not the function of<br/>the Committee to determine rights or assess violations of the contract.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties to the grievance may attend all or part of the Committee meetings as<br/>observers. At the solution stage, both parties will be available for input.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Committee shall be reached by consensus. If consensus is<br/>reached, such resolution shall be reduced to writing at the time of the meeting and<br/>will include any needed time lines. The agreement will be signed by the Committee<br/>members and shall constitute the Step 4 response to the grievance.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the committee does not reach consensus, or it is not agreeable to the grievant, the<br/>facilitator, if he/she deems necessary, has five (5) days in which to reconvene the<br/>Committee, one time, to attempt to achieve consensus of the Committee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 5: Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Step 4 is not successful, the grievant may, within five (5) working days, submit a<br/>request in writing to the President of the Association for binding arbitration of the<br/>dispute, with a copy forwarded to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association Executive Board will decide within ten (10) working days whether the<br/>matter will be sent to Binding Arbitration. The President of the Association will notify<br/>the Superintendent, in writing, of the decision.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association and District shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement</p>

<p>can be reached within ten (10) days, they shall request the State Conciliation Service<br/>to supply a panel of five (5) names of persons experienced in hearing grievances in<br/>public schools. Each party shall alternately strike a name until only one name<br/>remains. The remaining panel member shall be the arbitrator. The order of the<br/>striking shall be determined by law. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the<br/>hearing shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other expenses<br/>shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the<br/>issue or issues submitted to him. If the parties cannot agree upon a submission<br/>agreement, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written<br/>grievance and the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this<br/>agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures of the District.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written<br/>argument, the arbitrator shall submit in writing, to all parties, his findings and<br/>recommendations, including a remedy.</p>
<p>C. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases where an outside Mediator and/or Arbitrator is used, preference will be<br/>given to those versed in interest based bargaining, grievance mediation and public<br/>school labor/personnel matters.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mutual agreement, the arbitration may be held under the expedited Rules of the<br/>American Arbitration Association. Notice of such option shall accompany the<br/>Demand for Arbitration.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits indicated at each level of the grievance procedures set forth in the Article<br/>shall be construed as maximum and an attempt shall be made to expedite the<br/>process.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensions of the aforesaid time limits may be requested in writing by either party.<br/>Such requests shall state the extension period requested. Unless an extension is<br/>mutually agreed upon between the District and the Association, the time limits set<br/>forth herein shall be applicable.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances may be consolidated for purposes of arbitration by mutual agreement of<br/>the District and the Association.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance affects a group or class of Unit Members and the facts with respect to<br/>all grievants are substantially the same and the issue(s) raised by the grievance are<br/>the same as to all Unit Members involved, the Association may initiate and submit<br/>such grievance directly to the Superintendent. The processing of such grievance<br/>shall commence at Step 3.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matters dealing with alleged violations of Association rights, the grievance may be<br/>initiated at Step 3.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure, by<br/>himself, or, at the Unit Member’s option, by a representative of the Association. If a<br/>Unit Member is not represented by the Association or its representative, the<br/>Association shall have the right to state its views at all stages of the procedure.<br/>Likewise, District personnel may have a representative present at all stages of the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. In the event a Unit Member exercises the right to individually process a grievance</p>
<p>without assistance from the Association, the District shall provide the Association:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written copy of the grievance;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opportunity to be present at any meeting with the grievant;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable time to assert the Association’s position in regard to the matter;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written copy of any proposed resolution of the grievance;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opportunity to file a response before a resolution becomes final.</p>
<p>B. Only the Association, and not an individual Unit Member, may move a grievance</p>
<p>to Step 5 of this procedure.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees that Unit Members shall not suffer loss of compensation for time<br/>spent at a formal grievance hearing.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In processing grievances, the parties will make a good faith effort to avoid interruption<br/>of classroom activities and District operations and any unnecessary involvement of<br/>students as witnesses in all phases of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association will notify the District of those individuals authorized to investigate<br/>and process grievances on behalf of the Association.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall cooperate with the Association in the investigation of any grievance<br/>and shall provide the Association with such available information as is requested as<br/>necessary to effectively process a grievance and to discharge the Association’s duty<br/>of fair representation.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken against any Unit Member because of<br/>participation in the grievance procedure in accordance with the terms of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. All records dealing with the processing of grievances shall be filed separately from</p>
<p>the personnel files of the Unit Members.</p>
<p>B. These records cannot be transmitted to any other school district or agency without<br/>the mutual consent of the grievant and the District.</p>
<p>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances shall be prepared by the District and given appropriate<br/>distribution so as to facilitate operation of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the proceedings are pending, and until a final determination of the grievance<br/>has been made, all proceedings shall be private and confidential, subject only to<br/>mutual agreement for release of any information. This does not preclude the right of<br/>the grievant or District to private, personal consultation on the matter.</p>
<p>18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing or pendency of a grievance shall not impede, delay, or interfere with the<br/>right of the District to take actions complained of.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
<p>UNIT MEMBER PROTECTION AND SAFETY</p>
<p>The District shall conform to and comply with all health, safety, and sanitation requirements<br/>imposed by State or Federal law or regulations adopted under State or Federal law.</p>
<p>A unit member may use reasonable force as is necessary to protect himself or herself from<br/>physical attack, to protect the person or property of another, to quell a disturbance<br/>threatening physical injury to others or to obtain possession of a weapon or other dangerous<br/>object upon the person or within the control of a pupil, provided that in no event shall such<br/>force exceed the amount of physical control reasonably necessary to maintain order, protect<br/>property or protect the health and safety of pupils, or to maintain proper and appropriate<br/>conditions conducive to learning.</p>
<p>Employees shall immediately report cases of assault suffered by them in connection with<br/>their employment to their principal or other immediate supervisor who shall investigate and<br/>take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Any corrective disciplinary measures taken by unit members to protect their safety shall be<br/>in accordance with the procedures outlined in existing Board policies.</p>
<p>When, in the judgment of a unit member for safety reasons, a student requires the attention<br/>of a principal, assistant principal, a counselor, or other District specialist, the unit member<br/>shall so inform and discuss the concern with the principal. Upon notification and after<br/>discussing the matter with the principal, a unit member may arrange for a conference with<br/>an appropriate District specialist to discuss the problem and to recommend appropriate<br/>steps for the resolution.</p>
<p>The District may repair or replace personal property of a unit member such as eyeglasses,<br/>hearing aids, dentures, watches, articles of clothing necessarily worn or carried by the unit<br/>member, or vehicles when such property is damaged while in the line of duty without the<br/>fault or negligence of the unit member.</p>
<p>The District may pay either the repair cost or the actual value of the item at the time the<br/>damage occurred or whichever is the lesser. Replacing or repairing of such items will be<br/>limited to damages of values exceeding ten dollars ($10.00), but not in excess of one<br/>hundred dollars ($100.00). Collision, theft of a vehicle or contents, and damage of a vehicle<br/>resulting from actual theft are specifically excluded from this coverage.</p>
<p>When a unit member uses personal property in the educational program of the District and<br/>said property is damaged or lost as a result of arson, burglary or vandalism, the District shall<br/>reimburse the unit member for not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or less than ten<br/>dollars ($10.00) so long as written approval for the use of the specific personal property was<br/>given by the District prior to the property being brought on campus and the value of the<br/>property was agreed to at the time.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Prior approval shall be obtained from the school administrator or the person appointed by<br/>him for this purpose for the use of personal vehicles in the line of duty. Such approval shall<br/>contain all information identifying the vehicle to be used, insurance coverage to include<br/>limits of coverage, the insurance carrier and the condition of the vehicle.</p>
<p>In the event a payment is made under this policy, the District will, to the extent of such<br/>payments, be subrogated to any right of the unit member to recover compensation for such<br/>damaged property. The District will be entitled to enforce its subrogation right in any court of<br/>competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>A district wide committee of Management, STEA members and CSEA members shall be<br/>established to review and monitor safety procedures and issues, recommending changes as<br/>necessary. An STEA representative from each school site shall be a member of the district<br/>wide safety committee. In addition, there shall be a safety committee established at each<br/>school site consisting of representatives of the administration, STEA members and CSEA<br/>members.</p>
<p>Law enforcement and/or fire department staff shall conduct the bomb searches. No unit<br/>member shall search for or handle explosive or incendiary devices.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>UNIT MEMBERS' PERSONNEL FILES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official District Office personnel file of each unit member shall include, but not be<br/>limited to, the following items of information: required medical information; all unit<br/>member formal evaluation reports; copies of annual contracts; unit member<br/>certificates; a transcript of academic records; correspondence of a complimentary<br/>and derogatory nature; and tenure recommendation. All material placed in files shall<br/>be dated and signed by an appropriate administrator.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to paragraph A., above, a unit member shall have the right, upon request, to<br/>review the contents of his/her official District Office personnel file within two (2)<br/>working days of said request, provided there are no more than three (3) requests<br/>made in such two-day period, and to receive copies of said documents contained<br/>therein at the unit member's expense. LTUSD HR personnel will call/email unit<br/>member as to verification of receiving request and to schedule appointment to view<br/>file.</p>
<p>Any review of a unit member's personnel file must be made at a time when the unit<br/>member is not actually required to render services to the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature shall not be entered or filed in the official District<br/>Office personnel file, unless and until the unit member is given notice and a<br/>reasonable opportunity to review or comment thereon. The unit member shall have<br/>the right to enter and have attached to such derogatory statement his/her own<br/>comment thereon. Such review shall take place during normal business hours at a<br/>reasonable time.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>ARTICLE X</p>
<p>PUBLIC CHARGES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints concerning school personnel shall not be addressed in an open-session<br/>Board meeting unless the school employee requests in writing that the matter be in<br/>open session. Any citizen who begins to issue a complaint in open session shall be<br/>interrupted and directed to meet with the Superintendent regarding the matter.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complaint should not be brought to the Board nor addressed by the Board until the<br/>administration has had an opportunity to consider the matter.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of Board investigation of a public charge, such charge must first be<br/>reduced to writing, clearly specifying the events and dates surrounding the charge<br/>and signed by the complainant.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI</p>
<p>UNIT MEMBER HOURS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members shall serve one hundred and eighty-five (185) duty days.</p>
<p>180 instructional days</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-instructional days</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staff development days<br/>185</p>
<p>The two non-instructional days may include a maximum of 3.5 hours for required staff<br/>and/or district meetings. The remaining time is reserved for teacher preparation.</p>
<p>If snow or other events cause cancellation of classes, these days will be added to the<br/>calendar at the end of the school year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In order to compensate unit members for staff development days specified above,</p>
<p>each step on the salary schedule shall be increased according to the following<br/>formula: The salary reflected on each step shall be divided by 182 working days to<br/>determine the daily rate. Each step shall then be increased by an amount equal to<br/>three times the daily rate.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members, including part-time unit members, are required to attend three full<br/>days of staff development, comparable in length to the regular work day, and may<br/>not use sick leave or any other paid leave. Part-time unit members will attend a full<br/>day and receive full-day pay for staff development attendance. No pay will be made<br/>for attendance for a portion of a staff development day. The content and schedule for<br/>Professional Staff Development days shall be determined by a committee of up to 4<br/>Management and up to 4 STEA representatives. Criteria for approved staff<br/>development activities shall be determined by the committee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for some emergency reason a unit member is not able to attend all of the staff<br/>development time, the unit member’s pay will be reduced on a per diem basis for<br/>each of the staff development days not attended or completed. For those unit<br/>members who are unable to attend staff development activities due to unforeseen<br/>emergencies, make up days/opportunities will be provided. Make-up activities will be<br/>mutually agreed upon by the unit member and his/her immediate supervisor. All<br/>make-up activities will be completed annually by May 15.</p>
<p>Alternative staff development days(s), applicable to current teaching assignment may<br/>be selected with advance agreement between teacher and principal. Written request<br/>must be made 30 calendar days in advance of the alternative staff development or<br/>the scheduled staff development, whichever comes first. (Ed. Code 44579 - 44579.4)<br/>All make-up activities will be completed annually by May 15.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff development days shall be provided and offered to the extent they are funded<br/>by the State of California. If the State of California ceases to provide all or a portion<br/>of the funding for staff development days, then all or a portion of the staff<br/>development days shall be eliminated automatically without negotiation and the</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>salary schedule shall be reduced accordingly. The work year shall then be<br/>decreased from 185 total unit member work days so as to include only staff<br/>development days which are actually funded. In the event funding is not provided for<br/>staff development days, each step on the salary schedule shall be divided by 185 in<br/>order to determine the daily rate. Each step on the salary schedule shall then be<br/>reduced by an amount equal to the daily rate for each staff development day not<br/>offered and funded. For example, if the State of California reduces funding for staff<br/>development days by one day, then the daily rate at each step of the salary schedule<br/>shall be determined and each step on the salary schedule shall be decreased by said<br/>daily rate for each unit member. If the State of California reduces funding for staff<br/>development days by two days, then the salary schedule shall be reduced on each<br/>step thereof by twice the daily rate for each unit member.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher's regular (on duty) school work day normally shall commence thirty (30)<br/>minutes before the regularly-scheduled time for the beginning of the school day, and<br/>normally end fifteen (15) minutes after the regularly-scheduled time for the end of the<br/>school day.</p>
<p>The length of the work day on non-instructional days shall be the same length of time as<br/>if the regular schools were in session. If the length of the student day is reduced, the<br/>result of which still meets the State requirement for an instructional day, the length of the<br/>work day shall be the same length of time as if the regular schools were in session;<br/>however, the Superintendent may declare the early release of unit members when he<br/>has deemed it appropriate.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher work day shall include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least a thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch period at all levels.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the legally-required number of minutes of recess at the elementary schools.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Time</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members teaching grades K-5 shall receive an average of no fewer than 120<br/>minutes of preparation time per week, to be given during student contact hours,<br/>during regularly scheduled weeks.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation periods at the middle and high schools will be comparable to a<br/>regular teaching period.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation time shall be provided to full time employees on a regularly scheduled<br/>basis, except under emergency circumstances.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This preparation time shall be used for professional, job-related work.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>E. The District may establish teacher instructional time up to the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades K*-5 = 310 minutes (excluding recesses).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 6-8 = 350 minutes (including passing periods and preparation period).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 9-12 = 370 minutes (including passing periods and preparation period).</p>
<p>Refer to 04-07 Language if CSR funds go away.</p>
<p>(*MOU page xi)</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members assigned to non-classroom instructional duty for a majority of the day<br/>shall work the teacher's work day at the site to which they are assigned, with the<br/>exception of full-time driver training instructors who shall work a forty (40) hour week.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may be required to serve after completion of the regular (on duty) school<br/>day to participate in school-related activities, including: parent and student conferences,<br/>conferences with administrators and other unit members regarding students, District<br/>committees as assigned by the Superintendent or immediate supervisor, Open House,<br/>Back-to-School Night, faculty meetings, sponsorship and other meetings and functions<br/>designated by the Superintendent or his designee. Extra-duty assignments shall be<br/>assigned on a reasonable and equitable basis. These duties shall not be assigned<br/>arbitrarily, capriciously, or unfairly. Site meetings may be scheduled for no more than<br/>two hours per month outside of the regular work day.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall remain at the school site during the school's scheduled lunch<br/>period, unless the unit member has notified the principal.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District recognize the desirability of minimizing the number of<br/>different subject areas taught by the same unit member. Therefore, in making<br/>assignments, the District will consider the effect of the assignment on the number of<br/>subject areas taught by the unit member.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a unit member is required to cover another unit member's class during his<br/>preparation period, that time will be considered in determining the equitability of<br/>assignments under Paragraph &quot;F&quot;.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the elementary level, a half-time assignment shall be an assignment: a) from thirty<br/>(30) minutes before the beginning of the school day to the unit member's lunch schedule;<br/>or b) thirty (30) minutes before the start of his/her assignment to fifteen (15) minutes after<br/>the end of the school day.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary level, a part-time unit member shall commence thirty (30) minutes prior<br/>to his/her first period assignment and end fifteen (15) minutes after his/her last period<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time unit members are responsible on a pro-rata basis for all adjunct assignments<br/>normally required of a full-time unit member.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are paid in proportion to student contact time.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Contact Time Example: a high school teacher who teaches three out of five<br/>student contact periods will be compensated at 3/5 of time salary.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits Part time teachers working .75 and below will receive prorated benefits.<br/>Example: The 3/5 teacher would receive 60% (3/5) of the benefits package paid by<br/>the district, with 40% paid by the teacher. Teachers working .75 and above will<br/>receive the full benefit package.</p>
<p>0. Specific to 4 X 4 Schedule</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART-TIME ASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>Unit Members compensation for a part-time assignment (less than 3 sections per term) at<br/>South Tahoe High School, will be paid at .2 per section of the annual salary per term taught,<br/>not to exceed 0.5 FTE per term.</p>
<p>A Unit Member, teaching 3 sections in one term, shall be entitled to the same health benefits<br/>as a full-time (1.0 FTE) Unit Member for that term.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXTRA PERIOD TEACHING</p>
<p>Unit members assigned to teach during their prep on a voluntary basis will be compensated<br/>on a pro rata basis of their annual salary.</p>
<p>24</p>

Such request shall be in writing and shall state the dates the<br/>unit member wishes to begin and end the leave without pay.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination as to the date on which the leave shall begin and the duration<br/>of such leave shall be made at the discretion of the District, taking into account<br/>the recommendation of the attending physician, the expressed wishes of the unit<br/>member, and the scheduling and replacement problem of the District.</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a miscarriage or death of a child subsequent to childbirth, the unit<br/>member may request an immediate assignment to a unit position. In the case of<br/>a female employee, the physician must certify that she can carry out her<br/>assigned duties and responsibilities without damage to herself.

<p>3. SABBATICAL LEAVES</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to applicable State laws, sabbatical leaves may be granted by the Board<br/>of Education to certificated unit members where such leaves will improve their<br/>teaching skills and knowledge and thus benefit the schools and pupils of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>In accordance therewith, applicants shall submit for approval by the<br/>Superintendent a planned program of study, travel, or a combination of both,<br/>which shall be in furtherance of this objective.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the Superintendent's recommendation, the Board of Education<br/>may grant leave based on: a) the financial status of the District; and b) benefit of<br/>the proposed leave to the educational process. In no case shall the number of<br/>unit members absent on sabbatical leave at one time exceed two percent (2%) of<br/>the total number of certificated unit members.</p>
<p>Not more than one (1) such leave shall be granted to any individual in each<br/>seven (7) year period.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>At the expiration of a sabbatical leave, the unit member shall be reinstated to the<br/>position held immediately prior to the granting of the leave provided the position<br/>exists and provided further the unit member does not agree to accept another<br/>position within the District.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave applications must be submitted to the principal of the school in<br/>which the applicant is serving for his recommendations. When the applicant<br/>services have been very satisfactory, principals will recommend approval on the<br/>application form and forward such application and recommendations to the<br/>Superintendent prior to November 1 of the year preceding that in which the leave<br/>is desired. Applications filed after such deadline may be honored if, in the<br/>Superintendent's judgment, circumstances justify. Sabbatical leaves will be<br/>granted only for one (1) year.

<p>The unit member's normal percentage rate of deduction for retirement purposes<br/>shall be applied to the actual salary received. The sabbatical leave year is<br/>counted as one (1) year of service for retirement purposes.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interruption of a program of study or travel while on sabbatical leave, caused by<br/>serious illness or accident, which shall be verified by the attending physician and<br/>submitted to the Board for approval, shall not be held against a unit member with<br/>regard to the fulfillment of the conditions regarding study or travel under which<br/>the leave is granted, nor affect the amount of compensation to be paid the unit<br/>member while on leave, provided, however, that the Superintendent has been<br/>promptly notified of such accident or illness. In the case of such accident or<br/>illness while on sabbatical leave, notification shall be made by registered letter,<br/>mailed within thirty (30) days of the time of the accident or the onset of the<br/>illness.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member shall receive that<br/>portion of his monthly salary which, when added to the temporary disability<br/>compensation, will not exceed his regular monthly salary.

Such leave shall not be deducted from regular<br/>sick leave.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to require a unit member to furnish proof of cause<br/>of absence.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entitlement for industrial accident and illness leave has been exhausted,<br/>the unit member may elect to use any sick leave, vacation leave, or any other<br/>leave to which he is entitled for absence due to illness, provided that payment for<br/>any such paid leave, when added to any temporary disability indemnity, shall not<br/>result in a payment to the unit member of more than his full salary less<br/>appropriate deductions.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all available paid leaves have been exhausted and the unit member is unable<br/>to return to work, the unit member may elect to resign or to request a leave of<br/>absence without pay or be placed on a reemployment eligibility list for a period of<br/>thirty-nine (39) months.</p>

<p>35</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, the unit member who is called as a witness or for jury duty<br/>shall receive School District pay, less the amount of witness or jury duty pay<br/>up to the amount of the differences between the unit member's regular<br/>earnings and any amount received as witness or juror fees. To achieve this,<br/>the unit member shall receive full pay from the District provided the unit<br/>member endorses to the District any jury duty or witness pay received. Fees<br/>shall not include travel allowance.</p>

<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNAUTHORIZED LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>It is agreed and understood that there will be no strike, work stoppage, slow¬<br/>down or refusal or failure to fully perform assigned job functions and that<br/>commission of said activities will constitute unauthorized leave from District<br/>job responsibilities.

<p>The unit member must:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been employed by the District continuously in a full-time certificated position for<br/>at least ten years;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File a letter of intent to retire with the Superintendent by no later than February 1, of<br/>the year they enter the program;</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members approved for this program shall be eligible for a period of no more than<br/>5 years or to the age of 65, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>B. Early Retirement Incentive Program</p>
<p>Retirees meeting the eligibility criteria may provide additional service to the District,<br/>compensation for which shall be used for the purchase of the retiree’s continued medical<br/>benefits. The number of days service required for payment of the retiree’s medical insurance<br/>premium shall be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2008-2009 School Year (Grandfather Provision)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of retiree medical insurance shall be established no later than August 31 of<br/>each year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the 2008-2009 school year, for unit members who retired on or before<br/>June 30, 2008, the District agrees to pay the full amount of the medical benefits plan<br/>selected by each retiree at the beginning of 2008-2009 school year for retirees who<br/>meet the eligibility criteria set forth in Part A, above. The District will continue to pay<br/>the full amount of the medical benefits for unit member who retired prior to June 30,<br/>2008, and are still eligible, for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school year.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school year, for retirees who retired on or before<br/>June 30, 2008, and are still eligible, the District shall pay an amount not to exceed<br/>$7464.00 per year for medical benefits.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the plan to be paid by District under this provision shall include only the<br/>single coverage cost of the plan and the amount to be paid by District for any retirees<br/>coverage under this section shall not exceed the cost of the plan selected by the<br/>employee for the 2008-2009 school year, plus any cost increase for that plan in<br/>subsequent years. For the 2008-2009 school year, the plans available to retirees<br/>included only CVT Plans 7C, 8C, and 9C.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A retiree may select a more expensive plan or spouse or dependent coverage for<br/>their plan, but the District shall only be obligated to pay an amount equal to single<br/>retiree coverage under the plan the retiree had selected for the 2008-09 school year.<br/>The retiree shall be responsible for any cost above the amount of single coverage<br/>and the retiree may only work the number of days required to cover the cost of the<br/>plan, which was selected for the 2008-09 school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree’s final daily rate prior to retirement shall be divided into the cost of the<br/>retiree’s medical insurance for the year to establish the number of days which must<br/>be worked to pay for the medical insurance benefit.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days required to be worked to pay for the retiree’s medical insurance<br/>benefits shall be rounded to the nearest half day.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2008-2009 year, if any retiree has made premium payments for the cost of the<br/>plan they selected, and the retiree elects to work additional days to pay for their<br/>insurance coverage, the retiree will be entitled to a refund of the payment they made<br/>for the coverage to which they are entitled under this section. Flowever, for the 2008-<br/>09 year, any retiree who has worked additional days in excess of the original number<br/>of service days required (which was based on the amount of $5328 per year), and<br/>has been paid at the District substitute rate ($100 per day) shall have the amount<br/>already paid to the retiree deducted from any refund.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree shall enter into an agreement with the District to provide the number of</p>
<p>days service, calculated in the manner above, to pay for the retiree’s medical<br/>insurance benefits. At least half the number of days required to be worked for the<br/>year shall be performed during the first semester of the school year, with all days<br/>required to be completed prior to the end of the school year.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree’s final day rate prior to retirement shall be divided into the cost of the<br/>retiree’s medical insurance for the year (not to exceed $6,618) to establish the number<br/>of days which must be worked to pay for the medical insurance benefit.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days required to be worked to pay for the retiree’s medical insurance<br/>benefits shall be rounded to the nearest half day.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree shall enter into an agreement with the District to provide the number of<br/>days service, calculated in the manner above, to pay for the retiree’s medical<br/>insurance benefits up to $6,618.00 per year of eligibility.

<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If time limits set forth in this article are not met by the unit member or the<br/>Association, the Board of Education's decision shall not be subject to the appeal<br/>procedures and the Board of Education's decision shall be binding upon all parties.<br/>If time limits set forth in this article are not met by the Superintendent or the Board<br/>of Education, the suspension proceeding shall be dropped.</p>

<p>64</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXVIII</p>
<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREATION</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to create a Catastrophic Leave Bank effective<br/>4/1/01. The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be funded in accordance with the terms<br/>of section B below.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this section, a “day” shall be any day a unit member is expected<br/>to be on duty as determined by the terms of this agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank without regard<br/>to the daily rate of pay of the Catastrophic Leave Bank participant.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A three (3) member Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee appointed by the<br/>Association shall administer the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The terms of the<br/>Committee shall be staggered three-year terms. Initial appointments shall be for one</p>
<p>(1), two (2), and three (3) years. The LTUSD Human Resources Director or their<br/>designee shall be a non-voting member.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY AND CONTRIBUTIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members .5 FTE and above with the District at the time contribution are<br/>eligible to contribute to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires contribution to the Bank. Only contributors<br/>will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank unless otherwise mutually agreed upon<br/>in writing.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first becoming<br/>eligible have a waiting period of 60 working days after joining the Bank before<br/>becoming eligible to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution, on the appropriate form, shall be authorized by the unit member<br/>and continued from year to year until canceled by the unit member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation occurs automatically whenever a unit member fails to make her/his<br/>annual contribution or assessment. Cancellation, on the proper form, may be<br/>effected at any time and the unit member shall not be eligible to draw from the Bank<br/>as of the effective date of cancellation. Sick leave previously authorized for<br/>contribution to the bank shall not be returned if the unit member effects cancellation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>Unit members returning from extended leave which included the enrollment period</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>and new hires will be permitted to contribute within 30 calendar days of beginning<br/>work. The District shall supply enrollment forms for the Catastrophic Leave Bank to<br/>all new unit members and those unit members returning from leave.</p>
<p>7. The annual rate of contribution by each participating unit member for each school<br/>year shall be one (1) day of sick leave, which shall be deemed to equate to the legal<br/>minimum required by Education Code 44043.5.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional day of contribution will be required of participants if the number of<br/>days in the Bank falls below 25. Catastrophic Leave Bank unit member<br/>participants who are drawing from the Bank at the time of the assessment will<br/>not be required to contribute to remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank unit member participant has no remaining sick leave<br/>at the time of the assessment, she/he need not contribute the additional day to<br/>remain a participant in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days in the Bank at the beginning of a school exceeds 100, no<br/>contribution shall be required of returning unit members. Those unit members<br/>joining the Catastrophic Leave Bank for the first time and those returning from<br/>leave shall be required to contribute one (1) day to the Bank.</p>
<p>C. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BANK</p>
<p>1. Catastrophic Leave Bank participants whose sick leave is exhausted may withdraw<br/>from the Bank for catastrophic illness, injury, or recurring medical treatments.<br/>“Catastrophic illness or injury” shall be defined as any illness, injury, or recurring<br/>medical treatment, that incapacitates a unit member or a member of the unit<br/>member’s immediate family for over ten (10) consecutive duty days which requires<br/>the unit member to take time off work to take care of their self or their family<br/>member. “Recurring medical treatment” shall be defined as any serious, medically-<br/>necessary, regimented course of therapy, such as radiation, dialysis, chemotherapy,<br/>or other necessary medical treatment which would result in additional intermittent<br/>medical treatment requiring the unit member’s absence from work. If, after<br/>Catastrophic Leave is taken, and the unit member has returned to his/her regular<br/>duties, a reoccurrence of the original illness or injury, or a separate illness or injury,<br/>incapacitates a unit member or member of the unit member’s family, within 12<br/>months of the date returned to work, it shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5)<br/>consecutive duty days. If the recurrence of the original illness or injury occurs within<br/>the same school year, this five consecutive duty days requirement is waived.</p>
<p>2. The term &quot;immediate family&quot; is defined as mother, mother-in-law, father, father-in-<br/>law, sister, brother, husband, wife, child, grandmother, son-in-law, daughter-in-law,<br/>grandfather, grandchild of unit member or spouse, step-parent, step-child, registered<br/>domestic partner (as defined by California Family Code Section 297), or any relative<br/>living in the employee’s household. If there are no natural parents, the leave may be<br/>granted in the event of the death of a legal guardian or foster parent. Exceptions<br/>may be granted by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten (10) days of illness or disability must be covered by the unit member’s<br/>own sick leave the first time said unit member qualifies for a withdrawal from the<br/>Bank. For subsequent withdrawals within twelve (12) consecutive months, the first<br/>five (5) days of illness must be covered by the unit member’s sick leave or leave<br/>without pay.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is incapacitated, the participant’s agent or member of the unit<br/>member’s family may submit applications to the Committee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of no more<br/>than thirty (30) duty days. Unit members may submit requests for extensions of<br/>withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A unit member’s withdrawal from the Bank<br/>may not exceed the statutory maximum period of twelve (12) months.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick days will be paid at unit member’s current daily rate.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank will be required to submit a doctor’s statement indicating the nature of<br/>the illness or injury and the probable length of absence from work. Members of the<br/>Committee shall keep information regarding the nature of the illness confidential; all<br/>documents regarding the illness will be kept in a locked file in the Human Resources<br/>Director’s office. A unit member’s withdrawal may not exceed the statutory<br/>maximum period of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has drawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank days and requests<br/>an extension, the Committee may require a medical review by a physician of the<br/>Committee’s choice at the unit member’s expense. The Committee shall choose<br/>only a physician who qualifies under the District offered insurance policy. Refusal to<br/>submit to the medical review will terminate the member’s continued withdrawal from<br/>the Bank. The committee may deny an extension of withdrawal from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank based upon the medical report. The participant may<br/>appeal any termination under the procedures outline in section 12 below.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualifies the unit<br/>member for work compensation benefits unless the unit member has exhausted all<br/>worker compensation leave, his/her own sick leave, and provided further that the<br/>unit member signs over any worker compensation checks for temporary benefits to<br/>the District. If there are any worker compensation checks signed over to the District,<br/>the Bank will not be charged days, or if charged, will be reimbursed the number of<br/>days for which the work compensation payment is equivalent to a regular day of pay<br/>at the negotiated rate for that unit member. If the District challenges the work<br/>compensation claim, the unit member may draw from the Bank, but upon settlement<br/>of the claim, the Bank shall be reimbursed the days by the District.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee may reasonably presume that the applicant for a draw may be<br/>eligible for a Disability Award or a Retirement under STRS or, if applicable, social<br/>security, the Committee (as defined in A.5.) may request that the District have the<br/>unit member apply for disability or retirement. Failure of the unit member to submit a</p>
<p>complete application, including medical information provided by the unit member’s<br/>physician, within twenty (20) calendar days of the request shall disqualify the unit<br/>member for further Catastrophic Leave Bank payments. Any request for additional<br/>medical information from STRS or Social Security shall be submitted within ten (10)<br/>days or the unit member’s entitlement to Catastrophic Leave Bank cease. If denied<br/>benefits by STRS or Social Security, the applicant must appeal or entitlement to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall cease.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal<br/>request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide days and the District is<br/>under no obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If the Committee<br/>denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension of the withdrawal, because of<br/>insufficient days to fund the request, they shall notify the unit member, in writing of<br/>the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon exhaustion of sick leave<br/>or the waiting periods provided for in section B.3. and C.3., whichever is<br/>greater. For example, if a unit member contributed when first eligible to<br/>contribute and had ten (10) days of accumulated sick leave when the illness<br/>began, she/he shall begin withdrawing upon the eleventh (11<sup>th</sup>) duty day, if<br/>otherwise eligible. If the unit member had fifteen (15) days of sick leave at the<br/>beginning of the illness, she/he shall begin withdrawing days on the sixteenth<br/>(16<sup>th</sup>) duty day. If the unit member had five (5) days of sick leave at the<br/>beginning of the illness, she/he shall begin withdrawing days on the eleventh<br/>(11<sup>th</sup>) duty day.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank unit member participants who are denied a<br/>withdrawal or whose withdrawal is not renewed or terminated may, within thirty<br/>(30) days of denial, appeal, in writing, to the Executive Board of the<br/>Association. The Executive Board shall hold a hearing within fifteen (15) days.</p>
<p>The Executive Board shall issue a confidential written decision within fifteen<br/>(15) days of the hearing. If the unit member’s incapacitation does not allow<br/>participation in this appeal process, the unit member’s agent or member of the<br/>family may process the appeal. The determination of the Committee is final<br/>and not grievable.</p>
<p>D. ADMINISTRATION OF THE BANK</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank committee shall have the responsibility of maintaining<br/>the records of the Catastrophic Leave Bank, receiving withdrawal requests, verifying<br/>the validity of requests, approving or denying the requests, and communicating its<br/>decisions, in writing to the unit member participants, to the Association, and to the<br/>District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the Bank. The<br/>Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests complying with the terms of<br/>this Article. Withdrawals may not be denied on the basis of the type of illness or<br/>disability.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications shall be reviewed and may be investigated, and decisions of the Committee<br/>reported to the applicant, in writing, within ten (10) duty days of receipt of the application.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose the nature of the<br/>illness except as is necessary to process the request for withdrawal and defend against<br/>any appeals of denials.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 31<sup>st</sup> of each school year, the District and the Committee shall agree on the<br/>following:</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days contributed by unit members for the current year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of participating unit members.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days contributed by the District.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available in the Bank.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) day of each calendar month, the District and the Committee shall<br/>verify the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of any additional unit members who have joined accordance with<br/>section B.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of any unit members who have canceled participation in accordance<br/>with section B.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days in the Bank at the beginning of the previous month.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;added to the Bank by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new participants.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awarded during the previous month and to who they were</p>
<p>awarded.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days remaining in the Bank on the last day of the month.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be returned to the then current members of the<br/>proportionately.</p>

<p>CLASSIFICATIONS</p>

<p>An additional amount of money as specified on the salary schedule shall be granted to the</p>
<p>holders of each master's and/or doctoral degree earned from an accredited institution of</p>
<p>higher education.</p>
<p>A professional increment shall be paid for unit members who qualify (see Appendix D).</p>
<p>APPENDIX C</p>
<p>SALARY SCHEDULE - CONDITIONS AND DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>PLACEMENT ON THE SALARY SCHEDULE At the time of initial employment, a teacher will<br/>be placed on the salary schedule in the appropriate column reflecting the number of<br/>semester units acquired beyond the bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>Additionally, a teacher shall be granted credit, vertically, on the salary schedule for all paid<br/>public school service up to and including six years; maximum placement may be Step 7.</p>
<p>Only a complete school year will be counted as a year of prior service, although partial years<br/>may be added together to constitute a full year, provided the partial years were each at least<br/>a half school year. Not more than one year credit shall be given for any and all partial<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>Experience for peace corp teaching shall be granted if the unit member held a valid teaching<br/>credential at the time and the teaching was at a comparable level as determined by the<br/>District. This section shall apply only to those unit members hired after July 1, 1977, but shall<br/>not exclude those unit members being presently paid for such service.</p>
<p>At the District's option, unit members may receive credit for private school experience.</p>
<p>BACHELOR'S DEGREE A bachelor's degree must be from an accredited college or<br/>university as recognized or accepted by the State of California.</p>
<p>UNITS All units for salary schedule placement are in terms of accredited college semester<br/>units. Credit will be given for quarter or other type units, but only on the basis of semester-<br/>unit equivalency.</p>
<p>Quarter (1/4) units are converted to semester units by multiplying the quarter units by two-<br/>thirds (2/3). If this multiplication results in a fraction that, when added to the other semester<br/>units, is within one-half (1/2) unit from the required units for qualifying for the next column,<br/>then the fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number and the teacher shall be<br/>placed on the next column.</p>
<p>At the time of initial employment, only those upper division units acquired beyond the<br/>bachelor's degree will count toward proper column placement. Other units or credits may be<br/>approved for initial salary placement at the discretion of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>VERIFICATION It is the unit member's responsibility to see that the District receives<br/>verification of all experience and training. Forms for this purpose shall be available at the<br/>District Office.</p>
<p>Correspondence bearing a district letterhead from another school district and signed by a<br/>personnel officer is an acceptable source of verification for experience.</p>
<p>All units shall be completed by September 1<sup>st</sup> if a unit member wishes to move on the salary<br/>schedule. Only the Board of Education, or its designee, can authorize an extension of time.</p>
<p>Units shall be verified by official transcript; however, a grade card or other verification is<br/>acceptable on a temporary basis not to exceed one (1) year. If official receipts are not<br/>submitted to the District Personnel Office within the one (1) year period, the unit member's<br/>salary may be adjusted by the District to the appropriate column which reflects those units for<br/>which the District had received official transcripts.</p>
<p>Understanding that many colleges grant degrees on specific dates, generally at the end of<br/>the Spring session and at the end of the Fall session, it is possible for an individual to have<br/>completed all degree requirements but because of a late conferment date to not receive<br/>official verification until the following semester. Therefore, upon completion of all<br/>requirements for a Masters and Doctorate degree prior to September 1, a letter on college<br/>letterhead will be accepted from the registrar of the college or university verifying the<br/>anticipated date of completion of all course work and other degree requirements. The actual<br/>conferment date shall be verified by official transcript using the same conditions for<br/>verification of salary credit as stipulated in Appendix C. page iv.</p>
<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>SALARY SCHEDULE - GENERAL CONDITIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horizontal movement on the salary schedule shall be based on units above the<br/>bachelor's degree and must meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be approved by the school principal and be related directly to the subject taught,<br/>grade level taught, school level taught, a service performed by the unit member or be a<br/>planned program of professional improvement approved or recommended by the<br/>Superintendent or his designee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be acceptable if a grade or mark is at least &quot;C&quot; or passing.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be at least upper division units unless specifically approved by the unit member's<br/>supervisor or designated as an approved part of the District's inservice program.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not be a repeated course as identified by a course description, course number,<br/>and/or course content.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be reflective of a course or courses specifically or generally identified by a<br/>principal/supervisor to the unit number if the principal/supervisor feels that the unit<br/>member has a weakness that might be remedied by such a course.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertical movement on the salary schedule is based on one (1) year of service. One year<br/>of service is defined as sixty percent (60%) of the number of days that the regular schools of<br/>the District are in session. Vertical movement on the salary schedule shall be contingent<br/>upon the certificated employee being rated at least &quot;acceptable or better&quot; on each item<br/>considered in the year-end formal evaluation. Prior to the date of final evaluation, written<br/>notice shall have been given of potential below satisfactory areas of performance. If a review<br/>of the evaluation by the Superintendent results in the District's deciding to change the original<br/>evaluation, the salary freeze shall be lifted retroactively.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial teaching inside District (full semester teaching within the District in either<br/>probationary, permanent, or temporary status) may be added together without limitation for<br/>placement on the salary schedule. (In order for this provision to be operative, each unit<br/>member must notify the District within thirty (30) days after this agreement has been ratified<br/>of such experience in order to receive credit on the salary schedule).</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional increment shall be granted only to those unit members who meet the<br/>following criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a bachelor's degree and forty-five (45) units above the degree and have fifteen<br/>(15) years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a bachelor’s degree and sixty (60) units above the degree and have twenty-one<br/>(21) years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a bachelor’s degree and seventy-five (75) units above the degree and have twenty-<br/>four years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>v</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a bachelor’s degree and seventy-five (75) units above the degree and have twenty-<br/>six years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been rated at least &quot;acceptable or better&quot; on each item considered in evaluation.</p>
<p>Failure to maintain ratings of &quot;acceptable or better&quot; will result in the forfeit of the professional<br/>increment.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification - It is the unit member's responsibility to see that the District receives<br/>verification of all experience and training.</p>
<p>Quarter (1/4) units are converted to semester units by multiplying the quarter units by two-<br/>thirds (2/3). If this multiplication results in a fraction that, when added to the other semester<br/>units, is within one-half (1/2) unit from the required units for qualifying for the next column,<br/>the fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number, and the unit member shall be<br/>placed on the next column.</p>
<p>Units will be credited and movement to the next appropriate column of the salary schedule as<br/>of September of each year. Only the Board of Education can authorize an extension of time.<br/>To be eligible for column movement, the unit member must notify the District Personnel<br/>Office of a possible column change by June 1 of the preceding year.</p>
<p>Units shall be verified by official transcript; however, a grade card or other verification is<br/>acceptable on a temporary basis not to exceed one (1) year. If official transcripts are not<br/>submitted to the District Personnel Office within the one-year period, the unit member's<br/>salary may be adjusted by the District to the appropriate column which reflects those units for<br/>which the District had received official transcripts.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference Units - When a unit member attends training paid for by the District, and the<br/>training occurs on a unit member’s work day, #1 - #4 below apply. When a unit member<br/>attends training paid for by the District, and the training occurs outside a unit member’s work<br/>day, a unit member may be granted salary credit and #1, #2, and #4 apply.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is credit offered by an accredited college or university as recognized or accepted<br/>by the Sate of California.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credit will be documented by official transcript in the form of semester or quarter<br/>units.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The units member is required to do additional work outside of the conference attended.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary credit is paid for by the unit member.</p>
<p>vi</p>
<p>LAKE TAHOE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>COMPENSATION FOR EXTRA OR ADDITIONAL SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>APPENDIX E</p>
<p>BASIC POLICY: It is recognized by the Board of Education that the meeting of normal professional responsibilities<br/>may involve large amounts of teacher time outside of classroom hours. It is the general policy of the board that no<br/>extra duties are granted for assignments for which time is provided within the school day. A reasonable amount of<br/>extra school duties are recognized as being part of the teacher’s regular responsibilities, and compensation for these<br/>is included in the salary schedule.</p>
<p>Certain responsibilities, however, require excessive time in addition to regular class assignments or out-of-school<br/>duties. Should there be any assignment listed which may be handled largely within the extended school day, the<br/>District shall not be obligated to pay additional salary for this responsibility. It is recognized that the following<br/>responsibilities may, in many cases, exceed the school year, excluding the Department Chairperson.</p>
<p>All appointments to these positions shall be on the recommendation of the Superintendent and the approval of the<br/>Board.</p>
<p>All positions are paid the indicated percentage of annual salary rate based upon the 2000-01 salary schedule in effect<br/>through December 4, 2000. Off-campus coaches are paid the indicated percentage of Column I on the salary<br/>schedule. Not all positions are filled every year.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific job descriptions shall be provided for each extra-service position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term “head coach” is applied only to the person chiefly responsible for a varsity team; all other coaches are<br/>deemed assistant coaches. The head coach shall participate during the season, approve their practice and game<br/>schedules, and complete a written evaluation of their effort at the conclusion of the season.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any individual having the titles of both head coach and assistant coach in one sport must perform as two<br/>separate coaches in order to be so compensated. (For example, if a head coach also serves as assistant coach for a<br/>junior varsity team, he must direct or participate in each separate practice session, be present at each separate game,<br/>etc.)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual extra-duty stipends are added to the salaries of STHS and STMS teachers in recognition of the required<br/>extra-curricular student supervision duties outside of the regular work day.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual stipend for extra-curricular duties shall be paid to a unit member in a lump sum amount only after<br/>all individual extra curricular duty has been completed. Upon submission and approval of paperwork, payment will be<br/>ordered for next payroll submission.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to seven years of teaching experience may be granted for placement on the Appendix E salary schedule.</p>

</table><h5>Code of Ethics of the Education Profession</h5>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The educator, believing in the worth and dignity of each human being, recognizes the<br/>supreme importance of the pursuit of truth, devotion to excellence, and the nurture of<br/>democratic principles. Essential to these goals is the protection of freedom to learn and to<br/>teach and the guarantee of equal educational opportunity for all. The educator accepts the<br/>responsibility to adhere to the highest ethical standards.</p>
<p>The educator recognizes the magnitude of the responsibility inherent in the teaching<br/>process. The desire for the respect and confidence of one's colleagues, of students, of<br/>parents, and of the members of the community provides the incentive to attain and<br/>maintain the highest possible degree of ethical conduct. The Code of Ethics of the<br/>Education Profession indicates the aspiration of all educators and provides standards by<br/>which to judge conduct.</p>
<p>The remedies specified by the NEA and/or its affiliates for the violation of any provision of<br/>this Code shall be exclusive and no such provision shall be enforceable in any form other<br/>than one specifically designed by the NEA or its affiliates.</p>
<p>Principle I</p>
<p>Commitment to the Student</p>
<p>The educator strives to help each student realize his or her potential as a worthy and<br/>effective member of society. The educator therefore works to stimulate the spirit of inquiry,<br/>the acquisition of knowledge and understanding, and the thoughtful formulation of worthy<br/>goals.</p>
<p>In fulfillment of the obligation to the student, the educator -</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not reasonably restrain the student from independent action in the pursuit of<br/>learning.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unreasonably deny the student access to varying points of view.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliberately suppress or distort subject matter relevant to the student's</p>
<p>progress.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall make reasonable effort to protect the student from conditions harmful to<br/>learning or to health and safety.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intentionally expose the student to embarrassment or disparagement.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, national origin, marital status,</p>
<p>political or religion beliefs, family, social, or cultural background, or sexual orientation,<br/>unfairly -</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclude any student from participation in any program</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny benefits to any student</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant any advantage to any student.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not use professional relationships with students for private<br/>advantage.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not disclose information about students obtained in the course of<br/>professional service unless disclosure serves a compelling professional<br/>purpose or is required by law.</p>
<p>Principle II</p>
<p>Commitment to the Profession</p>
<p>The education profession is vested by the public with a trust and responsibility<br/>requiring the highest ideals of professional service.</p>
<p>In the belief that the quality of the services of the education profession directly<br/>influences the nation and its citizens, the educator shall exert every effort to raise<br/>professional standards, to promote a climate that encourages the exercise of<br/>professional judgement, to achieve conditions that attract persons worthy of the<br/>trust to careers in education, and to assist in preventing the practice of the<br/>profession by unqualified persons.</p>
<p>In fulfillment of the obligation of the profession, the educator -</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not in any application for a professional position deliberately make a false<br/>statement or fail to disclose a material fact related to competency and<br/>qualifications.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not misrepresent his/her professional qualifications.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not assist any entry into the profession of a person known to be<br/>unqualified in respect to character, education, or other relevant attribute.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not knowingly make a false statement concerning the qualifications of a<br/>candidate for a professional position.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not assist a noneducator in the unauthorized practice of teaching.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not disclose information about colleagues obtained in the course of<br/>professional service unless disclosure serves a compelling professional<br/>purpose or is required by law.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not knowingly make false or malicious statements about a colleague.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not accept any gratuity, gift, or favor that might impair or appear to<br/>influence professional decisions or action.</p>
<p>- Adopted by the NEA 1975 Representative Assembly</p>
<p>X</p>

<p>Lake Tahoe Unified School District (“District”) .</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>South Tahoe Educators Association (“STEA”)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake Tahoe Unified School District and South Tahoc Educators Association agree<br/>that effective for 2006-2007 school year, the District may implement Full day<br/>Kindergarten, Class Size Reduction Option 1 for Kindergarten. Continuation of<br/>this CSR program in future years will be contingent on appropriate funding from<br/>the State. The status of CSR funding and the Full day Kindergarten program will<br/>be reviewed by the District and STEA annually.</p>
<p>If Full Day Kindergarten is eliminated, the District will revert to current 04-07<br/>contract language:</p>
<p>E. The District may establish teacher instructional time up to the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten = 300 minutes (including one hundred (100) minutes of<br/>assistance).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 1-5 = 310 minutes (excluding recesses).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 6-8 = 350 minutes (including passing periods and preparation period).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 9-12 = 370 minutes (including passing periods and preparation<br/>period).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article XI - Unit Member Hours, shall be changed in part to read as follows:</p>
<p>D. 3.a. Unit members teaching grades K-5 shall receive an average of no fewer</p>
<p>than 120 minutes of preparation time per week, to be given during student<br/>contact hours, during regularly scheduled weeks.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Delete and incorporate with E.2.</p>
<p>E.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To be renumbered E. 1)</p>
<p>Grades K-5: 310 minutes (excluding recess).</p>
<p>Renumber E.3 and E.4 as E.2 and E.3.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if Full day Kindergarten is eliminated then #2 above would no longer</p>
<p>apply. Contract language would revert to 04-07 language in Article XI, Section<br/>D, a copy of which is attached.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>By and between<br/>LAKE TAHOE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>SOUTH TAHOE EDUCATORS’ ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>In re: REDUCTION IN BTSA STIPEND</p>
<p>During the 2012-13 school year, the Lake Tahoe Unified School District (“LTUSD”) has<br/>paid South Tahoe Educators’ Association (“STEA”) unit members, serving as Beginning<br/>Teacher Support and Assessment (“BTSA”) support providers, a stipend of $2000.00 per school<br/>year.</p>
<p>LTUSD and STEA agree that:</p>
<p>Pursuant to a 50% reduction in BTSA-required support hours to the BTSA program,<br/>commencing with the 2013-2014 school year, total hours will be reduced to a maximum of 45<br/>hours per year, per participating teacher. Therefore, the total cost for the program stipend shall<br/>be $1350.00 per participating teacher, per school year.</p>
<p>This MOU shall be in effect for the 2013-2014 school year, and may be extended only<br/>upon written and signed agreement by both parties.</p>
<p>Dated: March 12, 2013</p>
<p>By:</p>
<p>Lake Tahoe Unified School District</p>
