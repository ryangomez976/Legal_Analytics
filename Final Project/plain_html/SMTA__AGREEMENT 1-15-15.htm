<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee authorizing, engaging in, encouraging, sanctioning, recognizing or<br/>assisting any strike, slowdown, work stoppage, picketing in connection therewith or other<br/>concerted interference with the operations of the District in violation of this Article, or<br/>refusing to perform duly assigned services in violation of this Article may be subjected to<br/>disciplinary action up to and including termination at the District's discretion.</p>

<p>Before filing a completed Dispute Form (Appendix G), the Disputant shall attend an informal<br/>conference with his/her Designated Administrator for the purpose of clarifying the complaint<br/>and seeking resolution.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Disputant shall have thirty (30) calendar days from when he/she knew of<br/>the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the dispute, to request an informal<br/>conference.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Designated Administrator shall have three (3) days to schedule the<br/>informal conference. The three days shall commence upon the date following the date of<br/>request from the Disputant.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Designated Administrator shall have five (5) days from the date of the<br/>conference to render his/her written decision and suggested resolution regarding the dispute.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The informal level shall be concluded within a maximum of thirty-eight (38)<br/>days from the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the dispute.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the informal meeting has concluded, both the Disputant and the<br/>Designated Administrator shall complete and sign this form. A copy shall be retained by each</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>party. If the Dispute is taken to Level 1, a copy of the form shall be forwarded to both<br/>negotiation teams with the date of a scheduled meeting noted prior to being forwarded.</p>
<p>Step 2 - LEVEL I: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Disputant is not satisfied with the decision at the informal level, he/she<br/>may present the dispute in writing, on the appropriate forms (Appendix G), to the Designated<br/>Administrator and the Negotiating Team, within five (5) days of receiving the decision from<br/>the informal level.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, by written request to the Superintendent within five (5) days<br/>of the Disputants' request, may submit the Dispute to Level III.</p>
<p>Step 4 - LEVEL IE: FACILITATION/ARBITRATION:</p>
<p>1. The Association and the District shall by mutual agreement select a<br/>facilitator/arbitrator. E no agreement can be reached within five (5) days of the above<br/>request for arbitration of the Association, the parties shall request the California State</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Mediation and Conciliation Service to supply a list of five (5) names of persons experienced<br/>in Dispute Resolution in public schools. Each party shall alternately strike a name until only<br/>one name remains. The party to strike first is determined by a mutually agreed upon lottery.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any question arises regarding the arbitrability of a dispute, the<br/>facilitator/arbitrator shall make a determination of this issue prior to hearing the merits of the<br/>dispute, unless the facilitator/arbitrator determines that good cause exists to do otherwise.</p>
<p>[Language transferred from Process “B ” Number 3.]</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each Dispute, the facilitator/arbitrator shall conduct a telephonic pre-<br/>hearing conference for the purpose of clarifying the dispute and the issues to be heard. The<br/>conference shall be attended by a representative for the Disputant a representative for the<br/>District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If available the facilitator/arbitrator shall hold a hearing on the merits of the<br/>Dispute and a representative for the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilitator/arbitrator shall receive evidence and post written briefs, if<br/>requested by either party and shall submit his/her written findings and award to both parties<br/>within 30-calendar days of the hearing.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facilitator/arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or<br/>modify the terms of this Agreement, nor shall the facilitator/arbitrator be empowered to<br/>render a decision on issue(s) not before the facilitator/arbitrator, nor on facts not supported<br/>by the findings.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right of Representation:</p>
<p>The Disputant must be present at all stages of the processing of a dispute. However,<br/>the Disputant may be represented by the Association at all levels of the dispute resolution<br/>process.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispute Resolution Forms:</p>
<p>Forms for filing and processing a dispute shall be drafted by the District and the<br/>Association by mutual agreement, consistent with provisions of this Article. The District and<br/>the Association will use their best efforts to assure distribution of the forms to each school<br/>site. The cost of preparing such forms shall be borne by the District.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispute Resolution&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Files:</p>
<p>All documents resulting from the processing of a dispute shall be kept in &quot;Folder C,”<br/>(see the Personnel Files Article, XXI) which is a separate dispute resolution file and shall not<br/>be kept in an employee's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel file.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenses:</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the facilitator/arbitrator shall be borne equally by the<br/>District and the Association. If transcripts are requested, the cost shall be borne equally by<br/>the parties if the transcript is requested by either parties or the facilitator/arbitrator. If the<br/>transcript is requested by only one party, the party shall incur the expense. All other<br/>expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them. If either, or both, party(ies) request<br/>transcripts, a copy shall be provided for the facilitator/arbitrator.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Limits:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision rendered at any step in these procedures becomes final unless<br/>appealed within the time limits specified.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dispute is not processed by the Disputant and/or the Association in<br/>accordance with the time limits set forth in this Article, it shall be considered untimely and<br/>dismissed. If the District fails to respond to a dispute at any level in a timely manner, the<br/>running of its time limit shall be deemed a denial of the dispute and a termination of the level<br/>involved, and the Disputant may proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided for each level shall begin the day following receipt of<br/>the dispute, dispute appeal, or written decision.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that disputes be processed as rapidly as possible, the time<br/>limits specified at each level should be considered to be maximums and every effort should<br/>be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual<br/>written agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a dispute is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the levels in this dispute resolution procedure by the end of the school year and, if<br/>left unresolved until the beginning of the following school year could result in harm to the</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Disputant, the time limits set forth herein may be reduced by mutual written agreement of the<br/>District and the Association so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the<br/>school year or as soon as is practical.</p>
<p>6. Time limits given in these procedures may be modified by written agreement<br/>of the parties involved.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Reprisals:</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by any<br/>member or representative of the administration or the Board against any Disputant, any<br/>member of the Association or any other participant in the dispute resolution procedure solely<br/>because of the fact of such participation.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable Release Time:</p>
<p>Dispute Resolution meetings will be scheduled by the District at mutually<br/>convenient times and places. Normally such meetings will be scheduled in such a manner<br/>that they will not conflict with regular duties. However, when such meetings are scheduled<br/>so as to conflict with the unit member's work hours, reasonable release time without loss of<br/>salary will be provided to the affected unit member and his/her authorized Association<br/>representative, if any, and to scheduled witnesses while testifying at arbitration hearings.</p>
<p>This constitutes reasonable periods of release time within the meaning of Government Code<br/>Section 3543.1(c).</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the same dispute or substantially the same dispute is made by more than one<br/>employee against one party, only one employee on behalf of himself/herself and the other<br/>Disputants may process the dispute through the dispute resolution procedure. Names of all<br/>parties in the dispute shall appear on all documents related to the processing of the dispute.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may present disputes in accordance with this Article without<br/>intervention of the Association, so long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of<br/>this agreement. The District shall not agree to the final resolution of the dispute until the<br/>Association has been provided a copy of the proposed solution and has been given an</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>340 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity to file a response. The Association shall either accept the resolution or appeal to</p>
<p>341 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the next level within ten (10) days.</p>
<p>342 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the dispute involved an order/requirement, pending the final</p>
<p>343 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision of the dispute, the employee dispute shall in no way interfere with the right of the</p>
<p>344 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District to proceed in carrying out its management responsibilities subject to final resolution</p>
<p>345 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the dispute.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VI: WORK DAY, TEACHING HOURS, AND ADJUNCT</p>
<p>DUTIES</p>
<p>A. Work Day and Teaching Hours</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used throughout this Agreement, &quot;work day&quot; shall be defined as a day<br/>when unit members are required to be on duty whether or not such days are partial or<br/>minimum days for unit members as specified in the WORK YEAR Article XI .As used<br/>throughout this agreement, “day” refers to a work day, unless specifically specified to be a<br/>“calendar” day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that the varying nature of a unit member's day-to-day<br/>professional responsibilities does not lend itself solely to an instructional day of rigidly<br/>established length. The minimum school-based assignment hours shall be subject to the<br/>following provisions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional day at pre-school shall be three (3) hours and twenty-five<br/>(25) minutes, plus the requirements of paragraph 2e below; from 8:30 a m. to 2:15 p.m. for<br/>transitional kindergarten if TK class includes students from both elementary schools; from<br/>8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. if each elementary school has their own TK class: from 8:30 a m. to<br/>2:30 p.m. for grades K-3; from 8:30 a.m. to 2:50 p.m. for grades 4 and 5; from 8:00 a.m. to<br/>2:50 p.m. for grades 6 through 8; and from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. for grades 9 through 12.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are expected to remain a sufficient amount of time after the<br/>end of their last class or conference period to take care of student needs, attend scheduled<br/>parent or administrative conferences or meetings, and participate in assigned or voluntary<br/>adjunct duties.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be permitted to leave after the close of the regular<br/>instructional day on Fridays and the day preceding a holiday or vacation.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall establish the length, starting and ending times of the<br/>instructional day within the regular unit member work day specified in Paragraph 2a above.<br/>The District shall make every effort to provide a relief break for each bargaining unit<br/>member every two (2) hours.</p>
<p>SMTA/SMUSD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</p>
<p>AGREEMENT Rev. 8/26/14</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a part of their workday pre-school unit members shall assist in the<br/>primary grades as directed by the site administrator, in accordance with Section 46118 of the<br/>California Education Code.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall absent himself/herself for any reason from his/her<br/>assigned building during his/her working hours without notifying the building administrator<br/>or his/her designee.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a five (5) period day at San Marino High School and<br/>Huntington Middle School.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialists: The regular on-site work day for full-time non-classroom<br/>personnel in the bargaining unit shall be as follows: program specialists, librarians, nurses,<br/>counselors, speech pathologists and psychologists - seven (7) hours per day inclusive of the<br/>duty-free lunch period. However, it is recognized that their professional responsibilities will<br/>cause their workday to vary in length and times under the direction of their immediate<br/>administrator. In situations where a non-classroom unit member has worked substantially<br/>beyond the regular work day due to night meetings, late parent conferences and the like, the<br/>immediate administrator shall make a reasonable effort to schedule compensatory time off.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-Time: The workday for a part-time unit member shall be in the same<br/>ratio as his/her employment bears to full-time employment as determined by his/her<br/>immediate administrator.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty-free Lunch: Each unit member shall normally receive a daily lunch<br/>break of forty-five (45) minutes, as scheduled by the immediate administrator, of which<br/>thirty (30) minutes are to be uninterrupted, except when there are unscheduled fire drills or<br/>other such emergencies. On those days, including rainy days and smog alert days, when it is<br/>necessary to perform pupil supervision duties during their normal duty-free lunch period, unit<br/>members shall be permitted to leave after the close of the regular instructional day provided<br/>that the responsibilities described in Paragraph 2b above have been attended to or are<br/>rescheduled, if applicable.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifications: These minimum school-based assignment hours and duty-free<br/>lunch breaks shall be applicable to every scheduled work day provided, however, that such<br/>assignment hours may be modified by mutual agreement between the immediate</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>administrator and the unit member(s) involved, and that such lunch breaks may be used for<br/>voluntary faculty, grade level, or department meetings.</p>
<p>7. Minimum Day: For the purposes of this Agreement the on-site workday for<br/>unit members on District-authorized minimum school days called due to<br/>heat/smog/inclement weather shall be as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades K-8: five (5) hours, including the normal lunch break. Students<br/>will be dismissed at 12:30 p.m. and unit members shall have a duty-free lunch from 12:30 to<br/>1:15 p.m. Teachers' preparation period shall be during the student lunch, which will be<br/>approximately 20 minutes.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 9-12: four (4) hours and (30) minutes with no scheduled lunch</p>
<p>break.</p>
<p>c. On minimum days called for purposes of in-service training, curriculum<br/>planning, or the last day of the first and third quarters, the normal on-site hours are to be<br/>observed.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation or Conference Period. Except for District designated minimum<br/>days as defined or referred to in this Article and the WORK YEAR Article XL, unit members<br/>shall have the following preparation or conference periods:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members with classroom assignments in grades 6-12, except as<br/>provided below, shall have one (1) preparation or conference period per instructional day.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide all full-time teachers of grades 1-5 with<br/>preparation or conference times of at least thirty (30) consecutive minutes per normal<br/>instructional day.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education Teacher Conference Days: Each Special Education<br/>Teacher shall have five (5) conference days to perform the following duties:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working with students in mainstream classes;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing, modifying, monitoring individualized Educational Plans;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying curriculum for mainstream classes;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing and evaluating students' test results;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting with mainstream teachers, parents, etc; or,</p>
<p>SMTA/SMUSD<br/>AGREEMENT Rev. 8/26/14</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>f. Any other duties necessary to carry out the specific responsibilities of<br/>special education teachers. The scheduling of this time will be worked out at each site by the<br/>affected specialist, teachers, and administrators to their mutual satisfaction.</p>
<p>10. The District shall reduce the number of parent/teacher conference days for K-5<br/>teachers from five to four allowing one additional minimum day to be used for the purposes<br/>of staff development. If enrollment exceeds 26 students, including SDC students, in any one<br/>classroom in grades 4 and 5, the fifth parent-teacher conference day shall be reinstated as a<br/>minimum day for all teachers 4 and 5.</p>
<p>B. Adjunct Duties</p>
<p>Except as provided in the EXTRA ASSIGNMENT PAY Article XVII, unit members<br/>shall also be required to perform the following adjunct duties without additional<br/>compensation:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending faculty, departmental, grade level, and District or school-related<br/>meetings. Each Tuesday afternoon (not extending beyond 4:00 P.M.) shall be reserved for<br/>these aforementioned meetings unless changed by mutual agreement of the faculty and<br/>administrator. The parties acknowledge that unforeseen emergencies may arise which<br/>require additional meetings or meetings on days other than Tuesdays. The District will give<br/>advance notice of such meetings as far in advance as practical.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning, selecting, and preparing materials for instruction; evaluation work<br/>of pupils; conferring with parents; keeping records and studying current literature to keep<br/>abreast of developments within the subject matter taught by the unit member;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting professional responsibility to support school-related activities;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attending Back-To-School Night and Open House;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting for another unit member when in the judgment of the<br/>administrator any other method of covering the class of the absent unit member is neither<br/>practical nor reasonable to the efficient operation of the school or District. In the case of a<br/>full day absence of a teacher, the District shall make an attempt to obtain a substitute before<br/>assigning such coverage to regular staff. Such class coverage shall be equitably assigned by<br/>the administrator, and shall not, except in emergencies, require the interruption of more than<br/>one hour in grades K-5, or one preparation period for grades 6-12 for any one teacher on the</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>day in question. Each unit member may not be required to substitute by an administrator<br/>more than three periods per year. The unit member may refuse such requests once. This<br/>restriction is not intended to apply to voluntary service;</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such other adjunct duties that have been provided by unit members as per<br/>established past practice.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make every effort to see that the adjunct duty<br/>responsibilities are equally shared by all of the unit members at a particular school and that<br/>these responsibilities are scheduled as far in advance as possible so that unit members may<br/>plan their instructional preparation activities or other responsibilities to accommodate for<br/>such adjunct duties.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that at Huntington Middle School there are certain<br/>extracurricular student activities (such as certain dances), which teachers may supervise, for<br/>which admission is charged, and which could absorb the cost of a reasonable payment for<br/>such supervision without discouraging attendance. The District shall make a reasonable<br/>effort to arrange for such compensation from the sponsoring organization as has been the<br/>practice at the high school.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curriculum and Staff Development Planning Time:</p>
<p>a. For grades K-12, department or grade level meetings may be held two (2)<br/>days per semester for curriculum and articulation planning for the school year. Teachers may<br/>take up to four curriculum planning days per year with site administrator approval. A record<br/>will be kept to document this attendance, and this record will be returned to the principal.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For planning time held during the regular school day, a</p>
<p>Substitute will be provided. If a substitute is required, the request for a substitute must be at<br/>least fourteen days prior to the planning day.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By unanimous consent of the grade level or department, the planning day may occur<br/>outside the regular school day, with all participants receiving a stipend equal to the regular<br/>substitute rate. The planning day must be scheduled so all members of the grade level or<br/>department are in attendance for a total of six hours unless excused by the principal.</p>
<p>SMTA/SMUSD<br/>AGREEMENT Rev. 8/26/14</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>494 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. OTHER PROVISIONS:</p>
<p>495 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein is meant to limit or restrict the amount of voluntary</p>
<p>496 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;student contact by any unit member during any unassigned time.</p>
<p>497 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not assign any unit member classes requiring daily</p>
<p>498 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparation in more than three (3) different subject fields or four (4) different class</p>
<p>499 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparations without the consent of the unit member. When the Master Schedule is</p>
<p>500 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completed and before it is published at the sites, the District shall notify the Association</p>
<p>501 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President, in writing, of all teachers assigned at or above the maximum of three (3) different</p>
<p>502 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject fields and/or four (4) different class preparations and state reasons for the assignment.</p>

<p>20</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII: EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains the sole responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of<br/>performance of each unit member, subject only to the procedural requirements of this<br/>Article. Accordingly, no dispute arising under this Article shall challenge the substantive<br/>objectives, standards, or assessment techniques or evaluations determined by the evaluator<br/>or District, nor shall it contest the judgment of the evaluator; any disputes shall be limited to<br/>a claim that the procedures of this Article have been violated. For purposes of this clause,<br/>false facts set forth in the final evaluation document are considered procedural but no<br/>content issues shall be disputable.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose:</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that the principal purpose of evaluation is to<br/>improve and strengthen the quality of the instructional program and to improve performance.</p>
<p>TEvaluation forms for teachers, counselors, speech pathologists and psychologists may be<br/>found in Appendix D1</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Evaluation:</p>
<p>Probationary and temporary unit members shall be evaluated once each year.<br/>Permanent unit members shall be evaluated at least once every two years. The certificated<br/>evaluation cycle will be held at least once every five years for permanent personnel who have<br/>been employed at least 10 years, are highly qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801, and<br/>whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if the<br/>evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated mutually agree. The certificated<br/>employee or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator:</p>
<p>In most cases the evaluator shall be a unit member's principal unless another<br/>certificated administrator is designated by the District. If the District designates another<br/>certificated administrator as the evaluator instead of the principal, the unit member shall be<br/>so notified by October 15. In the unusual circumstance where an evaluator becomes</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>incapable of continuing service in that role during the evaluation cycle, the District may<br/>designate another qualified certificated administrator to complete the service as the evaluator<br/>for the unit member’s evaluation. The designated evaluator shall not be the Superintendent.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Meeting Regarding Evaluation:</p>
<p>Evaluators shall, by October 15 of each year, hold one or more staff meetings to<br/>review the procedures for setting standards and techniques for assessment, and for reviewing<br/>the evaluation calendar for the year.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for Setting Standards and Assessment Methods—Professional<br/>Development:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator and unit member jointly shall determine the unit member's<br/>professional goals and performance objectives for the school year. Development of these<br/>objectives and the criteria for their assessment shall be completed by October 31 except<br/>where extenuating circumstances cause a delay. Professional goals and performance<br/>objectives shall be stated in terms of the students wherever appropriate, and may include<br/>specific instructional methods, activities, and course content.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator may suggest additional goals and objectives for the unit<br/>member relating to criteria listed in the evaluation form. These suggestions must be<br/>identified as &quot;goals and objectives set by administrator.&quot;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of either the unit member or the evaluator, the standards<br/>established shall be subject to review and possible revision during the school year. The<br/>timing of the implementation of such revision shall be reasonably adapted to the<br/>circumstances of each case.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged that there may be constraints which hinder the attainment<br/>of objectives. Either the unit member or the evaluator may propose such constraints as part<br/>of the evaluation process subject to the provisions of Section F of this Article.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for Evaluation:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not formally or informally evaluate other unit members.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator may observe a unit member's performance at any time and may<br/>evaluate a unit member's performance at any time. If the evaluator requests that a unit</p>
<p>SMTA/SMUSD<br/>AGREEMENT Rev. 8/26/14</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>member present a particular type of lesson, the evaluator shall notify the unit member at least<br/>two (2) days in advance. Each formal evaluation shall be preceded by at least one formal<br/>classroom observation lasting at least thirty (30) minutes. In the absence of reasonable need,<br/>there will normally be two such formal observations preceding each annual evaluation. Each<br/>observation to be used for evaluation purposes shall be followed by a written observation<br/>report, a copy of which shall be given to the unit member. A conference between the<br/>evaluator and the unit member to discuss the observation and written observation report shall<br/>be held at the request of either party.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize that there are instances when the<br/>professional responsibilities of a unit member are not commonly observed during the course<br/>of a classroom observation. These instances shall be noted in Part 2, Section 7 of the unit<br/>member’s Observation Record.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written copy of the completed evaluation (Appendix D) shall be presented<br/>to the unit member no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the last student day of the<br/>school year in which the evaluation takes place.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have the right to initiate a written reaction or response<br/>to the evaluation. This response shall become a permanent attachment to the employee’s<br/>personnel file. Before the last school day scheduled on the school calendar, a meeting shall<br/>be held between the unit member and the evaluator to discuss the evaluation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of disagreement between the evaluator and unit member regarding the<br/>evaluation, the unit member may appeal to the Superintendent who may modify the final<br/>assessment made by the evaluator. If the unit member continues to object to the evaluation,<br/>he/she shall have a period of five (5) workdays following receipt of the final assessment to<br/>prepare and submit a written reaction in response to the evaluation. Such response shall<br/>become a permanent attachment to the evaluation which shall be placed in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with their sixth year in the District, unit members may be eligible for<br/>the Alternative Evaluation process as outlined in Appendix D, Part II.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawful Non-School Related Activities</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>The District shall neither inquire into nor predicate any adverse evaluation upon a<br/>unit member’s lawful political or lawful employee organization activities or preferences<br/>which have no impact on his/her effectiveness as an employee.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controversial Teaching Materials</p>
<p>No negative evaluation of classroom performance shall be solely predicated upon the<br/>unit member’s use of controversial teaching materials provided that such materials are<br/>consistent not only with the age and maturity level of the affected students but also with the<br/>District’s educational and curriculum guidelines and policies.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Aide Performance</p>
<p>Unit members will not be evaluated based upon their aides’ independent performance<br/>in the classroom.</p>
<p>SMTA/SMUSD<br/>AGREEMENT Rev. 8/26/14</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII: LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>A. General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leave of absence is an authorization for a unit member to be absent from<br/>duty, generally for a specific period of time and for an approved purpose. The District and<br/>the Association recognize that the California Education Code requires that the District grant<br/>some types of leaves of absence. These required leaves are incorporated into this Agreement<br/>by reference as if fully set forth herein, as such leaves now exist or may be changed from<br/>time to time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leave protects the unit member by holding a place in the District for such<br/>unit member until the leave expires, usually with the right to return to the District in a<br/>position of the same status and rank at the conclusion of the leave, providing the position<br/>would have otherwise remained. There is, however, no assurance that the return assignment<br/>will be in the school or administrative site where such unit member was assigned when the<br/>leave was authorized.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A condition of each leave of absence is that the credential or permit held at the<br/>time the leave was granted, properly authorizing the service, must be maintained in full force<br/>by the unit member.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on a paid leave of absence, unless otherwise provided herein,<br/>shall receive wages and health and welfare coverage, and retirement credits, the same as if<br/>they were not on leave. Those who go on an unpaid leave shall continue to receive benefits<br/>through the end of the pay period, and they may be allowed to remain on continued coverage<br/>at their own expense pursuant to the terms of the District’s applicable insurance plan,<br/>provided they make advance payment of the premium in a manner reasonably required by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who regularly works less than five (5) days a week or less<br/>than a full school year of service (September to June) shall be entitled to leaves of absence, if<br/>granted, in the same ratio that his/her employment bears to full-time employment.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilization of leave provisions under this Article for whole or partial day(s)<br/>shall be deducted from a unit member's leave entitlement whether or not a paid substitute was<br/>employed to replace the unit member on leave.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member returning from any and all absences must contact the school or<br/>site before 2:00 p.m. of the workday preceding the workday of intended return. One who<br/>fails to provide such notice of intention to return to duty before 2:00 p.m. of the work day<br/>prior to the work day of intended return shall be permitted to return to duty that work day and<br/>shall be charged with the cost of the services of a substitute, provided the District is unable in<br/>its discretion to utilize the substitute elsewhere.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that a unit member who is absent from work other than for those<br/>days as authorized by State Law, or authorized leave provisions of this Agreement, is taking<br/>an unauthorized absence in breach of contract and in violation of this Agreement. The<br/>District will deduct a salary amount equal to the ratio of days absent to the days of required<br/>annual service.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of each month, the Unit Member shall complete the Monthly<br/>Employee Absence Report for absences incurred during that month.</p>
<p>B. Sick Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of sick leave utilization shall be for physical and emotional<br/>disability absences which make continued employment impracticable, or for legally<br/>established quarantine.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are employed full time for five (5) days a week for a<br/>school year of service (September to June) shall be entitled to ten (10) days of leave of<br/>absence annually (September through June) for illness or injury. Unit members shall receive<br/>full pay for sick days thus allowed in any school year, and the number of days not used shall<br/>accumulate from year-to-year. Every unit member who works less than five (5) days a week<br/>or less than a school year of service (September to June) shall be entitled to sick leave in the<br/>same ratio that his/her employment bears to full time employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable sick leave credit for any one school year need not be accrued prior<br/>to being taken by the unit member during said year. Such leave may be taken for workdays<br/>during the instructional school year (September through June) and summer school as<br/>provided in the Summer School Article XII. Should a unit member terminate employment<br/>prior to earning sick leave taken in advance of accrual, the District retains the right to recover<br/>any overpayment by any legal means of redress.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Earned or accumulated sick leave shall not be considered as vacation, nor<br/>shall a unit member be reimbursed for unused sick leave at the time of separation except for<br/>purposes of retirement as provided by law.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave shall not be transferable from one unit member's accumulated<br/>balance to that of another unit member under any circumstances.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unused sick leave credit may be used by the unit member for sick leave<br/>purposes, as defined, without loss of compensation. Upon exhaustion of all accumulated sick<br/>leave credit, a unit member who continues to be absent under the provisions of this Article<br/>shall receive the difference between his/her pay and the amount actually paid a substitute, or<br/>if no substitute was employed, the average amount that would have been paid to a substitute<br/>if one had been employed unless the unit member requests to use days without pay. In order<br/>to qualify for differential pay, a unit member shall utilize available leaves in the following<br/>sequence:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Industrial Accident or Illness leave days, when applicable;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All remaining current year days credited for sick leave;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no event shall days of differential pay exceed five (5) school months in any<br/>school year. Only one increment of differential pay shall be allowed for any single and<br/>continuous illness that continues into the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If requested to do so by the District, a unit member whose absence under this<br/>Article exceeds five (5) consecutive work days shall provide, at the District's expense, a<br/>statement from a medical doctor or licensed practitioner indicating an ability to return to<br/>his/her position classification without restrictions or detriment to the unit member's physical<br/>and emotional well-being, or to the physical and emotional well-being of his/her students.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the prerogative of the District to require verification of any absence<br/>if the District reasonably believes that the absence may not have been used for proper sick<br/>leave purposes. If the District does request any such verification referred to in this<br/>paragraph, said request and reasons therefore shall be put in writing. If the District requests<br/>verification from a doctor or licensed practitioner, the District shall pay the reasonable cost<br/>of obtaining the verification if illness is verified, and the unit member shall pay if illness is<br/>not verified.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>10. The District shall provide each unit member with an accounting of the number<br/>of days of illness/injury leave he/she has accumulated, plus the number of days to which the<br/>unit member is entitled for the current school year. An accounting of such days shall be<br/>provided to unit members by November 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Leave</p>
<p>The Association President or his/her designee shall have a maximum of three (3) days<br/>of paid leave to utilize for Superintendent-approved state or national conferences, such as<br/>PTA meetings. The Association may annually request up to ten (10) days of leave for other<br/>lawful Association business. The Association shall reimburse the District for five (5) of the<br/>days. It is agreed that no one unit member shall take all ten (10) days per year of Association<br/>leave. The representative(s) shall be excused from school duties upon two (2) days' advance<br/>written notification to the Superintendent by the Association President.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to a maximum of three (3)</p>
<p>days leave of absence, exclusive of other leaves, without loss of salary for attendance at the<br/>services conducted fewer than 300 miles (one way) from the District Office, for the death of<br/>any member of his/her immediate family as defined in Paragraph 3 below.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to a maximum of five (5) days leave of<br/>absence exclusive of other leaves without loss of salary for attendance at the services<br/>conducted 300 miles or more (one way) from the District Office for the death of any member<br/>of his/her immediate family as defined in paragraph 3 below.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;immediate family&quot; is defined as follows: the parent, legal guardian,<br/>child, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law,<br/>sister-in-law, son-in-law, and daughter-in-law of the unit member or the spouse or ex-spouse<br/>of the unit member; or significant other</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall also be entitled to a maximum of one (1) day leave of<br/>absence exclusive of other leaves without loss of salary for attendance at the services<br/>conducted either in California or out of state for the death of an aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew<br/>of the unit member or the spouse of the unit member.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Return from Unpaid Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is on unpaid leave and wishes to return prior to the scheduled<br/>or agreed upon termination date of the leave, the unit member may request in writing an<br/>immediate assignment to a unit position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District determines there is a vacancy for which the unit member is<br/>qualified, he/she shall be assigned to a position as soon as practical.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering its determination, the District is under no obligation to dismiss or<br/>terminate the services of another employee to make available a position for the returning unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident and Illness Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident and illness leave shall be granted to unit members in<br/>accordance with provisions of this Section for injury or illness incurred within the course and<br/>scope of the unit member's assigned duties.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to qualify for industrial accident or illness leave coverage or Workers'<br/>Compensation benefits, a unit member claiming such leave or benefits shall submit a<br/>statement from a District appointed physician or his/her treating physician and/or any<br/>physician appointed by the compensation insurance administrator indicating the unit<br/>member's disability, subject to the provisions of Paragraphs 4 and 5 below.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be permitted to return to service after an industrial<br/>accident or illness leave only upon presentation of a release from the treating physician<br/>and/or the compensation insurance administrator's appointed physician(s), if any, subject to<br/>the provisions of Paragraphs 4 and 5 below.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case where an examination is conducted or where a release is certified<br/>by a physician other than a District appointed physician and the District has a reason to<br/>believe the diagnosis issued or the release presented by such physician(s) is incomplete or<br/>unclear, the District may require, at its expense, a subsequent evaluation of the unit member<br/>by a District appointed physician certified in the area of diagnosis necessitated by the<br/>particular accident or illness. Furthermore, the District reserves the right to require an<br/>examination of a unit member at District expense by a District appointed physician within<br/>thirty (30) days of an industrial accident or illness provided, however, that a unit member</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>may utilize his/her own physician if he/she has on file at the District Office (prior to the<br/>occurrence of the industrial illness or injury) the name of the physician.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statements and/or releases as referred to in Paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 above shall<br/>attest to the unit member's ability to perform the full schedule of duties and responsibilities of<br/>his/her position without restrictions and without detriment to his/her physical and emotional<br/>well-being or to the physical and emotional well-being of his/her students. Such statements<br/>or releases shall be made on a form provided by the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who has sustained a job-related injury or illness shall report<br/>the injury to his/her immediate administrator on the District Accident Report Form the same<br/>work day the injury or illness occurs or the work day which the unit member reasonably<br/>should have known of the illness or injury or no later than the next scheduled work day<br/>following the accident if such accident occurs after school hours, unless the unit member's<br/>condition makes it physically impossible to file such form.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall be for not more than sixty (60) work days in any one<br/>fiscal year for the same illness or accident. Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from<br/>year-to-year. If the same illness or injury extends into the next fiscal year the unit member<br/>shall be allowed to use only the amount of leave remaining from the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of absence,<br/>and shall be charged by one (1) day for each day of authorized absence regardless of a<br/>temporary disability indemnity payment.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member receiving benefits as a result of this Section shall, during<br/>periods of injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless the District<br/>authorizes travel outside the state.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any industrial paid leave of absence, the unit member may endorse to<br/>the District the temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of the industrial<br/>accident or illness. The District, in turn, shall issue the unit member appropriate salary<br/>warrants for payment of his/her salary less normal deductions, authorized contributions, and<br/>temporary disability indemnity amounts equal to the indemnity checks retained by the unit<br/>member, if applicable. Payment of such salary warrants by the District is contingent upon<br/>the unit member providing the required accident report and physician(s) statements.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon conclusion of the industrial paid leave, the unit member may utilize any<br/>available sick leave benefits. However, any sick leave utilization, when combined with any<br/>temporary disability indemnity, compensatory time, or vacation, shall not result in payment<br/>of more than full salary. For sick leave purposes, the absence under this procedure shall be<br/>deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the industrial paid leave.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member receiving benefits under this industrial accident or injury<br/>section who has been medically released for return to duty and who fails or refuses to accept<br/>an assignment for which he/she is credentialed and competent may be deemed to have<br/>abandoned his/her position on the effective date of the assignment.</p>
<p>G. Jury Duty Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jury duty leave is granted to enable a unit member to serve as juror if an<br/>official notification calling for such duty is received. Leave shall be granted for the period of<br/>time directed by the court.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall receive his/her regular salary if jury duty is served<br/>during the regular school year. Any jury duty fees, less mileage allowance, shall be<br/>forwarded to the Business Office. A court attendance report shall also be submitted at the<br/>end of each calendar month.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent on jury duty shall count toward all benefits as though active<br/>service were rendered.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members desiring exemption or postponement shall notify the site<br/>principal in writing and attach the official jury duty notification. A written request for an<br/>occupational exemption or postponement will be sent to the appropriate court for the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who would require class coverage (a substitute) will be paid the<br/>daily substitute rate for each day of jury duty if such duty is served during the summer<br/>vacation, winter break, or spring break instead of during the regular school year. The teacher<br/>must begin jury duty at least ten working days prior to the first day of the new school year.</p>
<p>To be paid, the teacher must submit to the district a time sheet supported by the jury duty<br/>service voucher indicating the number of jury days served.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of such leave of absence, the unit member may be employed<br/>by the District to perform such less than full-time service requiring certification<br/>qualifications, as may be mutually agreed upon. Such absence shall not affect in any way the<br/>classification of such unit member.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within six (6) months after the term of office of such unit member expires,<br/>he/she shall be entitled to return to the position held by him/her at the time of his/her<br/>election, at a salary to which he/she would have been entitled had he/she not absented<br/>himself/herself from the service of the District under this Article.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision of the Education Code to the contrary, a<br/>person employed to take the place of such unit member shall not have any right to such<br/>position following the return of such unit member to the position.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth,<br/>and recovery there from are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be<br/>treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available<br/>in connection with employment by the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided herein, written and unwritten employment policies and<br/>practices of the District shall be applied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the<br/>same terms and conditions applied to other temporary disabilities.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Care Leave</p>

<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons that are serious in nature, which cannot be expected to<br/>be disregarded, which necessitate immediate attention and which cannot be dealt with during<br/>off-hours.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subsection the reasons for personal necessity shall be<br/>judged in relation to the seriousness, unexpectedness and necessity of (a)-(l) above.</p>
<p>2. Unused personal necessity leave entitlement shall not be accumulated from<br/>year-to-year. The number of days of personal necessity leave shall not exceed the number of<br/>full days of unused sick leave to which the unit member is entitled annually.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be required to verify the nature of such necessity if<br/>requested by the District, except that such statement shall be filed with the site administrator<br/>no less than five working days in advance of a religious holiday or court appearance whether<br/>or not requested by the District. Advanced notice may be given but is not required to be<br/>given when the leave is for other than religious holidays or court appearances. The site<br/>administrator shall take whatever steps are reasonably necessary to become satisfied that a<br/>personal necessity within the limits of the section did exist.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall make every reasonable effort to comply with District<br/>procedures designed to secure substitutes and shall notify the immediate administrator of the<br/>expected duration of the absence at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of questionable use of personal necessity leave, the District reserves<br/>the right to review and verify a unit member's use of such leave.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the remittance referred to in subsection K (i) (1) (2) above is submitted to<br/>the District Office, the unit member shall be paid the salary to which he/she is entitled. If the<br/>unit member does not make such remittance, the amount of the witness fee(s) shall be<br/>appropriately deducted from the unit member's salary warrant.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstance shall leave provided by this Section be applied to<br/>offset absenteeism taken by the unit member for the purpose of participating in a work<br/>stoppage in this or any other district or to interfere in any way with the normal and orderly<br/>operation of the District as specified in the Work Stoppage Article IV of this Agreement.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances shall leave provided by this Section be used for such<br/>purposes as vacation and/or recreational activities.</p>

<p>(3) days as paid confidential leave per year. Requirement of verification will be waived for<br/>these three (3) days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused confidential leave days shall not accumulate from year to year and the<br/>time taken will be charged against sick leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except where extenuating circumstances make such notice impossible, unit<br/>members are encouraged to notify their immediate supervisor as soon as possible of their</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>intent to take confidential leave so proper substitute coverage and any other necessary<br/>arrangements can be planned in advance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall continue to encourage its membership to be professional<br/>in its use of confidential leave days.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidential leave shall not be taken for extension of school holidays, school<br/>breaks, or staff development days.</p>

The Sabbatical Leave Committee<br/>shall be appointed, when necessary, by the Board of Education, and it shall be composed of<br/>non-unit members.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation. The unit member's compensation shall be one-half (1/2) of the<br/>base salary which he/she would have received had he/she been teaching his/her regular<br/>assignment during the period of leave.

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer. An involuntary transfer is a transfer initiated by</p>
<p>the District.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening. An opening is an unfilled position which the District has<br/>determined to be filled by a probationary or permanent employee rather than by a substitute<br/>or temporary employee. The District shall have the sole authority to determine when and<br/>where there is an opening.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicability. This Article shall apply to probationary and permanent<br/>unit members only, and not to temporary unit members.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting</p>

The<br/>opening notice shall contain a closing date for submitting requests for transfer, which shall be<br/>not less than ten (10) days after posting. The opening shall not be filled until after the<br/>closing date. The notice of opening shall include the position description and location, grade<br/>level, and/or subject matter assignment, credential and/or experience requirement, and other<br/>job-related qualifications, special skills or desired qualities upon which the site administrator<br/>intends to base his/her selection.

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a Voluntary Transfer/Reassignment Application shall not<br/>jeopardize the unit member's present assignment and may be withdrawn at any time prior to<br/>the applicant's notification of new assignment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall consider each Voluntary Transfer/Reassignment<br/>Application submitted in response to the posting and shall also consider each unit member<br/>who has previously submitted a Voluntary Transfer/Reassignment Application for the school<br/>in question. Such a standing application shall expire at the end of the school year or after six</p>
<p>(6) months, whichever is later. New hires, unit members returning from leave, and unit<br/>members being involuntarily transferred may also be considered.</p>
<p>d Qualified unit members who have been involuntarily transferred from<br/>their previous school shall be given first consideration for openings at that school.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent (or his/her designee) shall determine whether to<br/>grant or deny Voluntary Transfer/ Reassignment Applications. The criteria to be considered<br/>in such determinations shall include the credential(s) held by the unit member in relation to<br/>the staffing needs of the District, the unit member's instructional strength(s) in the subject<br/>matter required for the opening, and the quality of performance as determined by the<br/>supervisor responsible for evaluation.

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an involuntary transfer is deemed necessary, the initiating<br/>administrator will submit a written rationale to the Superintendent with a copy to the affected<br/>unit member. An opportunity must be provided for the unit member to meet with the<br/>administrator recommending the transfer prior to effecting the proposed transfer. The unit<br/>member may file a written response to the reasons given.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written request of the unit member, the written rationale and/or<br/>this response shall be placed in the unit member's personnel file.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members to be involuntarily transferred shall have the right to<br/>indicate their preferences in writing from a list of openings.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members involuntarily transferred shall be placed in positions as<br/>comparable as practicable.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be involuntarily transferred more than twice in<br/>any three year period.</p>
<p>B. REASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>

<p>members.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member desiring reassignment to any posted opening may<br/>submit a Voluntary Transfer/Reassignment Application.

After implementing such a change, the site administrator<br/>shall discuss the reasons for the change with the unit member, if the unit member so requests.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to implementing a change in a unit member's grade level, subject<br/>matter assignment, and/or classroom location, the site administrator shall (assuming the unit</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>member is available) consult with the unit member and shall consider the unit member's<br/>views and suggestions, if any.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OPENINGS OCCURRING BETWEEN AUGUST 15 AND OCTOBER 1</p>
<p>When an opening occurs between August 15 and October 1, it may be filled on an</p>
<p>interim basis with a new hire, or by a “surplused&quot; unit member from a school with a<br/>declining enrollment or reduced program, without regard to the posting procedures; it may<br/>also be filled by an involuntary transfer pursuant to Section I, D, above. However, if the<br/>opening is thus filled by a new hire, and the position is retained for the following year, it is to<br/>be posted as an opening in spring, and the new unit member shall then be considered along<br/>with any other applicants to fill the position for the subsequent year.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MISCELLANEOUS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When transfer, reassignment, or relocation of a unit member requires<br/>transportation of the unit member's materials to a different location, the District will provide<br/>packing and unpacking assistance and transportation if requested by the unit member.</p>

The District<br/>and SMTA can mutually agree to allow more than these two (2) days if circumstances<br/>warrant. The District and SMTA can also mutually agree to compensate teachers who move<br/>classrooms during summer months if impossible to move during the school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a school closure or other major change in operations (such as<br/>the elimination of a program), the District will consult with the Association regarding<br/>transfers resulting from such closure or change no less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to<br/>the implementation of such transfers.</p>
