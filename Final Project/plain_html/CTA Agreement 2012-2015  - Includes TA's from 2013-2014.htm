By notifying the<br/>Program Administrator, the teacher may take non-instructional time for personal<br/>convenience.

<p>Special Education - Non-instructional Program- Related Duties</p>
<p>5.15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that teachers in some county-operated classes are required to<br/>supervise and/or arrange supervision of the students to a greater extent than regular<br/>education teachers. This student supervision time (contact time) has increased with<br/>the program directive that mandates that county-operated classes be aligned with<br/>district classes for the daily beginning and ending times</p>
<p>To address the instructional, supervision, and teacher preparation requirements<br/>during the workday, it is acknowledged that there is teacher judgment on blending<br/>these components. Teachers, through collaboration with the program supervisors,<br/>shall identify regularly scheduled periods during the student day that will allow for<br/>non-instructional program-related work to be completed. It is also expected that<br/>there will be opportunities for the teacher to complete non-instructional program-<br/>related duties while students are on task and supervised by an Instructional<br/>Assistant or other approved supervisory staff.</p>
<p>Nothing in these statements is intended to distract or encroach on the instructional<br/>minutes as set by statute, or decrease the quality of instruction. It is acknowledged<br/>that non-instructional program-related duties are an essential part of the<br/>instructional program. Detailed planning, the completion of records, and IEPs are<br/>fundamental to the educational program.</p>

Should the employee choose to provide<br/>preapproved staff development which occurs outside the normal scheduled onsite<br/>hours, the staff development work will qualify for additional compensation at the<br/>daily rate of pay, prorated on the ratio of hours worked to the employee’s regular<br/>school year workday, (see 3.8)</p>

<p>8.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such statutory family and medical leave status includes up to 12 weeks per year<br/>(referring to the 12-month period beginning on the date any FMLA/CFRA<br/>commences) as leave of absence, due to:</p>
<p>8.11.1.1 childbirth, or adoption, commencement of foster care, or infant care of the<br/>employee’s child</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave taken to care for a newborn or foster or adopted child must be<br/>completed within one (1) year of the birth or placement. Also, in these<br/>circumstances, if both spouses are employed by the County Office of<br/>Education, the combined total FMLA/CFRA shall be limited to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State-required leave of absence (CFRA/PDL) due to employee disability<br/>caused by pregnancy, childbirth and related conditions, is not credited<br/>against the 12 (FMLA) weeks of leave.</p>
<p>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.11.1.2 the serious illness or health condition of the employee</p>
<p>8.11.1.3 the serious illness or health condition of the employee’s spouse (or<br/>registered Domestic Partner - CFRA only), the employee’s child or the<br/>employee’s parents.</p>

<p>primary care-giving responsibility, and the reference to “parent” includes<br/>biological, adoptive or foster parent, or any other person who had primary care¬<br/>giving responsibility for the employee when the employee was a child.</p>
<p>8.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have been employed by the County Office of Education at<br/>least one (1) full year and provided at least 1,250 hours of service immediately<br/>prior to such leave in order to qualify for the leave. Full-time teachers are<br/>presumed to work 1,250 hours.</p>
<p>8.11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule any such absence or<br/>related medical treatment so as to avoid disruption of the County Office of<br/>Education’s operations, and shall give the County Office of Education at least 30<br/>days advance notice of such leave plans. However, if the need for such leave is not<br/>foreseeable, the employee shall give notice within two (2) business days of<br/>learning of the need. Failure to provide timely notice may result in postponement<br/>of the protections of FMLA.</p>
<p>8.11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County Office of Education may require written certification to be issued by<br/>the health care provider of the person with the serious health condition, including<br/>certification of the date on which the condition commenced, the probable duration<br/>of the condition, an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to care<br/>for the individual, if the leave is due to the serious health condition of a child,<br/>spouse or parent, and a statement that the illness warrants the participation of the<br/>employee or renders the employee unable to perform his or her job functions. The<br/>County Office of Education may also require medical certification of fitness to<br/>return to work. Failure to produce any required certification shall result in denial of<br/>FMLA/CFRA. If the County Office of Education doubts the validity of the<br/>certification, it may require that the employee or other disabled person obtain a<br/>second opinion of a health care provider selected by the County Office of<br/>Education, at the County Office of Education’s expense. If the two opinions<br/>conflict, the County Office of Education may require a third opinion from a health<br/>care provider mutually agreed upon by the County Office of Education and the<br/>employee. The third opinion shall be final and binding on the County Office of<br/>Education and the employee. If the statutory leave is being granted concurrently<br/>with another leave under this Article, then the normal contract procedure shall<br/>prevail over the above special certification process.</p>
<p>8.11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent required by applicable laws, employees returning from a<br/>FMLA/CFRA leave shall be returned to the same position, or to a position<br/>comparable to the position, they occupied prior to their leave.</p>
<p>8.11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County Office of Education shall maintain the employee’s coverage under any<br/>applicable health plan for the duration of any family leave under this section in the<br/>same manner as if the employee were working.</p>

<p>8.11,8 If the employee fails to return upon expiration of the leave for a reason other than<br/>the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would<br/>itself have met the qualifications for FMLA/CFRA, then the County Office of<br/>Education may recover health insurance premiums paid pursuant to the above<br/>leave &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provisions.</p>
