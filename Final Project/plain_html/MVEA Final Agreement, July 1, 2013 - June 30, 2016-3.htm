<p>3.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than one before and/or after school staff meeting,<br/>district-wide grade level meeting, Back to School Night, or<br/>Open House shall occur in one week. Meetings held within the<br/>professional day specified by Section 3.1.2 shall not count as<br/>one of these activities.

<p>3.1.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the intent of the Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement relative to sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.6 is that a<br/>bargaining unit member who attends Student Study Team<br/>meetings, because the student in question is in their class, are<br/>performing the professional responsibilities outlined in section</p>
<p>3.1.3 and are not entitled to the compensation outlined in<br/>section 3.1.6 of the Agreement. On the other hand, bargaining<br/>unit members who are permanent members of Student Study<br/>Teams as outlined in section 3.1.6 of the Agreement are entitled<br/>to the compensation outlined in that section and in subsection<br/>5.8.</p>
<p>3.2 Preparation Time Within the Regular Workday</p>
<p>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time bargaining unit members at the middle schools shall have an<br/>average of one uninterrupted class period (based upon a seven period<br/>day) set aside each day for preparation purposes unless an unusual<br/>circumstance arises, e.g., emergency drills, state mandated testing.<br/>Bargaining unit members at the middle schools who have a regularly<br/>assigned class period that takes place before or after the usual school<br/>day, shall have one additional period each day, which shall be duty free.<br/>Should a scheduling problem arise, the solution shall be reached by<br/>mutual agreement of the teachers and administrators involved.</p>
<p>3.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bargaining unit member loses a preparation period, the<br/>bargaining unit member shall be compensated in accordance<br/>with section 5.8 of this Agreement, and shall be compensated<br/>at the highest hourly rate if the member provided instruction to<br/>students during such lost preparation period.</p>

<p>5</p>
<p>one adjusted day per week to be used for a sixty (60) minute preparation<br/>period and a minimum of forty (40) minutes of collaboration time as<br/>outlined in section 3.5 of this agreement. This schedule shall begin on<br/>the first week of school. If during the work year the adjusted day falls<br/>on a holiday or conference day, the adjusted day shall not be provided.</p>
<p>3.2.3 Preparation time is considered duty time.</p>
<p>3.2.4. In light of class size reductions at grades K-3 and increased instructional<br/>minutes at grade 4 and 5, the 4/5 grade bargaining unit members shall<br/>receive an average of two (2) forty-five (45) minute preparation periods<br/>per week for a total of seventy-two (72) preparation periods per year.</p>
<p>The District shall determine the method of coverage and content for<br/>these two preparation periods.</p>
<p>3.2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bargaining unit member loses a preparation period, the</p>
<p>bargaining unit member shall be compensated in accordance<br/>with section 5.8 of this Agreement, and shall be compensated<br/>at the highest hourly rate if the member provided instruction to<br/>students during such lost preparation period.</p>

Each elementary school and each middle school<br/>shall receive substitutes to cover release time for spring conferences to<br/>be determined by the principal. (Conferences shall be scheduled at times<br/>mutually agreeable to the teacher and the parents.)</p>
<p>3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the District's designated minimum days shall be used for<br/>bargaining unit members' preparation on the day of Back-to-School Night<br/>or Open House, to be determined by the staff.</p>
<p>3.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum day shall be considered a regular work day for staff.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Minimum Davs in Support of School Records</p>

<p>3.4.2 A total of four (4) minimum days will be scheduled pursuant to this</p>
<p>section each school year. This provision does not modify the practices of<br/>the District or provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement relative<br/>to the scheduling of other minimum days during the work year.</p>
<p>3.5 Collaboration Time</p>
<p>The Mountain View Educators Association and the District agree that the<br/>purpose of collaboration time is to enhance and promote student achievement<br/>of grade-level standards. During this collaboration time grade level bargaining<br/>unit members, or other forms of collaboration teams, will meet to discuss<br/>curriculum planning and instructional practices and to address the needs of their<br/>classroom and target students.

<p>3.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration meeting will not be interrupted by administrative, i.e., non-<br/>instructional, issues, except in emergencies.

An<br/>alternative teacher-in-charge will also be chosen from the list. If there</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>are no volunteers from the staff, the principal, in the same manner will<br/>solicit staff and then select a teacher-in-charge and alternate teacher-in-<br/>charge. The alternate teacher-in-charge will fill in if the teacher-in-charge<br/>is not available.</p>

<p>3.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Time</p>
<p>Upon mutual agreement, a substitute teacher may be hired to substitute<br/>for the teacher-in-charge if the administrator is out for a full day or more.<br/>The district or site, depending upon the reason for the principal's<br/>absence, will cover the cost of the substitute.</p>
<p>3.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation</p>

The bargaining unit member shall have ten (10)<br/>days from this notification to exercise a right of return to that<br/>site. If the bargaining unit member does not exercise this return<br/>right the bargaining unit member may still apply for the position<br/>but will no longer have return rights and shall be given<br/>consideration in accordance with the provisions set forth in 4.3.<br/>This provision shall not apply in cases of school closure.</p>
<p>4.4.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member involuntarily transferred shall not<br/>be involuntarily transferred again for a minimum of two (2) years<br/>without the consent of the bargaining unit member. This<br/>provision shall not apply to bargaining unit members who are<br/>transferred to a school that is subsequently closed.</p>

<p>** For unit members who are moving classrooms.</p>
<p>4.8 Elementary Combination Class Assignment</p>
<p>4.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the need for a combination class arises, volunteers will be sought<br/>from the affected grade levels at that site.

<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equivalent semester hours for professional growth shall be credited for<br/>advancement on the salary schedule in the same manner as courses<br/>taken at colleges and universities.</p>
<p>5.4 Experience Steps</p>
<p>The bargaining unit members' salary schedule shall contain experience steps:</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification I, II, III, and IV shall contain 10 steps, from 0 through 10<br/>years of experience.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bargaining unit members shall be placed on the salary schedule<br/>according to their educational qualifications and their satisfactory<br/>teaching experience as determined by the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum of 5 years shall be allowed for previous experience for those<br/>in Classification I, 6 years in Classification II, and maximum of 9 years<br/>allowed for those in Classification III through V.</p>
<p>5.4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals hired with preliminary or clear California credentials<br/>will be appropriately placed on the salary schedule and will<br/>experience subsequent schedule movement as outlined by the<br/>collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>5.4.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals who do not possess a preliminary credential (i.e.<br/>individuals who are enrolled in intern programs, or other such<br/>examples which may not be anticipated by the parties at this<br/>time) will be placed at step one, column one of the salary<br/>schedule as shall remain at step one, column one until they<br/>obtain a preliminary or clear credential.</p>
<p>5.4.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the District will not be required to make</p>
<p>a distinction as to the amount of experience credit a newly hired<br/>bargaining unit member with a preliminary or clear credential<br/>brings from another public school employer, even if prior service<br/>included year without a preliminary or clear credential. When<br/>initially placing a newly hired bargaining unit member on the</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>salary schedule, the District may rely solely on the experience<br/>credit history provided by the previous employer.</p>
<p>For example: if an individual worked in another school district<br/>for four years, three of which were with an emergency<br/>credential and one of which was with a clear credential, the<br/>previous employer would indicate to the District that the<br/>individual had four years of experience. Since this individual<br/>possesses a preliminary or clear credential they would be placed<br/>at Step 5.</p>
<p>On the other hand: if this individual had never obtained a<br/>preliminary or clear credential and had four years of<br/>employment with an emergency credential, they would be<br/>placed according to the provisions of 5.4.3.2.</p>
<p>5.4.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will develop appropriate criteria for placement of<br/>newly hired bargaining unit members who possess a preliminary<br/>or clear credential but whose experience was in private school<br/>settings. These criteria will be consistent in its application and<br/>will adhere to the uniform salary schedule provisions of<br/>Education Code Section 45028.</p>
<p>5.4.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5.4.3.4 of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement<br/>addresses initial placement on the salary schedule for newly<br/>hired bargaining unit members who possess a preliminary or<br/>clear credential. Under the provisions of this section, individuals<br/>who complete 75% of the work year with another public school<br/>employer are credited with a full year of experience for that<br/>service. As currently written, this section does not provide for<br/>initial placement credit for fully credential individuals who have<br/>worked part time for other public school employers.</p>
<p>5.4.4 A year of teaching experience must have been for at least 75% of the<br/>number of days in that school year except as noted in section 13.9 of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>5.4.4.1 Current Employee Movement: a year of teaching experience</p>
<p>must have been for at least 75% of the number of days in that<br/>school year. Credit for salary schedule movement for current<br/>bargaining unit members who participate in job sharing teams is<br/>governed by the provisions of section 13.9 of this agreement.</p>
<p>Credit for less than full time experience shall be granted to<br/>individuals who have completed at least 75% of the number of</p>
<p>days of their contractual assignment and who meet the other<br/>requirements for initial placement outlined in Section 5.6.6.</p>
<p>5.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day-to-day substitute teaching will not be considered as teaching<br/>experience to be credited for salary schedule placement.</p>
<p>5.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full year's credit for prior teaching experience shall be allowed for two<br/>one-half years of experience if they have been in the same year even<br/>though in two different school districts.</p>
<p>5.5 Longevity</p>
<p>Classifications I through V, steps 13-19, provide for recognition for years of</p>
<p>service in the District (longevity). Years of service in the District do not need to</p>
<p>be consecutive.</p>
<p>5.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals hired with preliminary California credentials will be<br/>appropriately placed on the salary schedule and will experience<br/>subsequent salary schedule movement as outlined by the collective<br/>bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>5.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals, who are enrolled in intern programs, or other such examples<br/>which may not be anticipated by the parties at this time, will be placed at<br/>step one, column one of the salary schedule and shall remain at step<br/>one, column one until they obtain a preliminary clear credential.</p>
<p>5.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the District will not be required to make distinction<br/>as to the amount of experience credit a newly hired unit member with a<br/>preliminary or clear credential brings from another public school<br/>employer, even if proof service included years without a clear credential.<br/>When initially placing a newly hired unit member on the salary schedule,<br/>the District may rely solely on the experience credit history provided by<br/>the previous employer.</p>
<p>5.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will develop appropriate criteria for placement of newly hired<br/>bargaining unit members who possess a clear credential but the<br/>experience is in private school settings. These criteria will be consistent in<br/>its application and will adhere to the uniform salary schedule provisions<br/>of Education Code Section 45028.</p>
<p>5.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5.4.4 of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement addresses<br/>initial placement credit on the salary schedule for newly hired employees<br/>who possess a preliminary or clear credentials. Under the provisions of<br/>this section, individuals who complete 75% of the work year with another<br/>public school employer are credited with a full year for experience for</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>that service. As currently written, this section does not provide for initial<br/>placement credit for fully credentialed individuals who have worked part<br/>time for other public school employers.</p>
<p>The parties recognize that some individuals work in part time<br/>assignments or are engaged in &quot;job sharing.&quot; It is the intent of the<br/>parties to credit newly hired unit members for part time assignments on a<br/>pro-rated basis. In order to achieve this goal, the parties agree as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>5.5.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to receive initial placement credit for a full or partial<br/>assignment with another public school employer, the newly<br/>hired individual must possess a preliminary or clear credential<br/>and must have worked at least 75% of the number of days of<br/>that contracted assignment.</p>
<p>Example I</p>
<p>An individual worked as a full time employee in a 187-day work<br/>year assignment, they would have had to work for 75% of 187<br/>days.</p>
<p>Example II:</p>
<p>An individual's full time equivalent status was 1.0 but they<br/>worked for only a single semester assignment in a 187-day<br/>work year, they would have had to work for 75% of 93 or 93.5<br/>days in order to be credited with one-half of a full year's credit.</p>
<p>5.5.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an individual meets the criteria in section (a), the District will<br/>determine the initial placement credit. In calculating the amount<br/>of credit an individual will receive for initial placement; the<br/>District will total the years, or partial years, of experience with<br/>the previous district(s). The calculated total will then be<br/>rounded off using a threshold of .75 or greater to determine<br/>whether a partial year will count as one year of credit or one-<br/>half year of credit. Below .75 rounds down. For example:</p>
<p>Employee &quot;A&quot; has worked five years full time for a previous<br/>employer. They receive five years service credit and are placed<br/>at Step 6.</p>
<p>Employee &quot;B&quot; has worked a total of 4.8 years, mixing full and/or<br/>part time employment, for a previous employer. The employee<br/>receives five years service credit (4.8 rounds up to 5.0) and is<br/>placed at Step 6.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Employee &quot;C&quot; has worked a total 4.6 years, mixing full and/or<br/>part time employment, for a previous employer. They receive<br/>four years service credit (4.6 rounds down to 4.0) and are<br/>placed at Step 5.</p>
<p>5.6 Benefits</p>
<p>5.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California school employees are covered by California Workers<br/>Compensation laws. Bargaining unit members are insured whenever<br/>they are at school. Bargaining unit members are also insured away<br/>from school when they are on duty and engaged in bona fide work for<br/>the District.</p>

<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive salary schedule advancement, the bargaining unit member must<br/>request and receive course work approval from the school principal and<br/>Assistant Superintendent. Such approval shall not be unreasonably denied. If<br/>salary schedule advancement is denied, the principal or assistant superintendent<br/>shall provide a written statement of the reasons for denial within 5 days of the<br/>bargaining unit member's request for course work approval.</p>

<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional growth activities will vary but they should relate to professional</p>
<p>and educational goals, such as:</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>□ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improved or updated knowledge of the subject area or techniques</p>
<p>□ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeper understanding of the learning process</p>

Either party<br/>may ask to revert back to the traditional every other year schedule.</p>
<p>10.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of ascertaining the degree of progress toward agreed upon<br/>objectives, the evaluator shall conduct during the first trimester, when<br/>appropriate, at least one observation lasting at least 20 minutes. These<br/>observations shall be scheduled between the evaluator and teacher at least<br/>three (3) days in advance or by mutual agreement.

<p>10.16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>Permanent (tenured) bargaining unit member with five (5) years of District<br/>service may choose self-directed evaluation if the following criteria have been<br/>met:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recent evaluation is satisfactory in all areas.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principal agrees that a self-directed evaluation best serves the<br/>professional growth of the bargaining unit member.</p>

<p>12.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bargaining unit members shall notify the District Office absence<br/>notification system (650) 526-3560 when they will be absent. Such<br/>notice shall be given as soon as possible so a substitute may be<br/>obtained if necessary. An absent bargaining unit member may submit<br/>the name of a preferred substitute teacher.</p>
<p>12.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeated, unexcused failure to provide notice to the District of an<br/>absence may result in disciplinary action.</p>

<p>12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;sick leave&quot; is construed to mean the automatic leave of<br/>absence granted to bargaining unit members when such absence is the<br/>result of an illness, injury, disability, accident, or quarantine of the<br/>teacher, or bargaining unit member's children, spouse, or parents.</p>
<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members employed full-time five days a week during<br/>the regular school year shall be entitled to one day per month worked</p>

<p>12.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members who are absent from duty because of a legally<br/>established quarantine are entitled to the same salary consideration as<br/>though they were personally ill. The absence shall be counted as sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>12.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each school year, bargaining unit members shall<br/>receive a sick leave allotment credit equal to the anticipated sick leave<br/>entitlement for the school year. Bargaining unit members may use any<br/>credited sick leave at any time during the school year for sick leave<br/>purposes.</p>
<p>12.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five (5) consecutive workdays of absence, the bargaining unit<br/>member shall furnish satisfactory proof of necessity for sick leave if<br/>such proof is requested by the Superintendent or designee.

<p>12.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member is absent from duties due to illness,<br/>temporary disability or accident for a period of five (5) school months<br/>or less, whether employment related or not, the amount deducted from<br/>salary due in any month of absence shall not exceed the cost of the<br/>substitute, whether or not a substitute was hired.

Personal necessity leave shall not be used for the sole<br/>purpose of extending a holiday or vacation period.

<p>12.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member shall submit a completed personal<br/>necessity leave request form including the specific reason for the leave<br/>for days (that are not-discretionary) to the school principal or<br/>immediate supervisor whenever possible within three (3) working days<br/>prior to requesting the leave. The principal or immediate supervisor will<br/>forward the leave request to the Superintendent or designee. The<br/>District retains the right to deny personal necessity leave (including<br/>discretionary days) provided the denial is not arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p>12.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member shall not be required to secure prior<br/>permission for personal necessity leave for any of the following<br/>reasons:</p>

<p>12.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each<br/>day of authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability<br/>indemnity award.</p>

<p>12.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal<br/>year, the bargaining unit member shall be entitled to only the amount<br/>of unused leave due for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>12.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the<br/>bargaining unit member shall be entitled to the benefits provided in<br/>Education Code Sections 44977, 44978, 44983. For the purposes of<br/>each of these sections, absence shall be deemed to have commenced<br/>on the date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave,<br/>provided that, if the bargaining unit member continues to receive</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>temporary disability indemnity, the bargaining unit member will, after<br/>having full written notification, begin to use accumulated sick leave.<br/>When this is added to the temporary indemnity, it will result in a<br/>payment of not more than full salary.</p>
