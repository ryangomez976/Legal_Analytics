<p>If premium costs for any plan selected by the bargaining unit member exceed<br/>the corresponding amounts listed above, then the full amount of excess cost<br/>shall be the responsibility of the bargaining unit member. For example if the<br/>premium amount of the employee only Scripps plan in Premium Year 2014 is<br/>$1,672.00 more than $6,179.40, then the bargaining unit member’s contribution<br/>shall be the full $1,672.00 difference.

<p>At nny time the parties may meet informally to address committee<br/>recommendations.
