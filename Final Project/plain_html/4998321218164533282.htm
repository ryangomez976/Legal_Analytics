<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article protects the rights of individual employees without restricting<br/>HPTA/CTA/NEA's right to require every bargaining unit employee, except<br/>those exempt from these provisions, to pay a fair share of the cost of<br/>collective bargaining activities.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as expressly provided herein, all employees in the bargaining Unit<br/>who do not maintain membership in good standing in HPTA/CTA/NEA are<br/>required as a condition of employment, to pay service fees to<br/>HPTA/CTA/NEA, in the amounts that do not exceed the periodic dues of<br/>HPTA/CTA/NEA, for the duration of this agreement.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee shall be obligated to pay dues or service fees to<br/>HPTA/CTA/NEA until the first of the month following 30 calendar days<br/>after the employee first comes into the bargaining unit.</p>

<p>from revising the assignment if the instructional needs of<br/>students warrant the revision.</p>
<p>12.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a single subject credentialed unit member is reassigned more<br/>than one new prep then they shall be deemed as involuntarily<br/>reassigned and shall have the right of first return to prior assignment<br/>should it become available in the future.</p>
<p>A multiple subject unit member who is involuntarily reassigned to<br/>another grade level shall have right of first return to prior assignment<br/>should it become available in the future.</p>
<p>12.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member shall not be required to change classrooms involuntarily more<br/>than once in a 3 year period without compensation. If such additional<br/>involuntary classroom change is deemed necessary by the district, the<br/>member will be compensated by one release day or one day sub<br/>compensation for each additional move in a three year period.</p>
<p>12.5 Release Time</p>
<p>Unit members who are transferred or reassigned during the school year shall<br/>be allowed three (3) days of release time for preparation prior to the<br/>effective date of the transfer or reassignment.

<p>ARTICLE 13 - JOB SHARING</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing shall refer to a District approved assignment in which two (2)<br/>unit members share one (1) full time position. Job sharing assignments<br/>shall be filled only by credentialed teachers who have jointly agreed to<br/>work together and have submitted a proposal of tandem teaching to the<br/>Superintendent or designee who shall have the right to approve or deny the<br/>job sharing request. A permanent unit member is defined as a teacher who<br/>holds tenure status in the District or has two years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>In addition, the job sharing team must be Highly Qualified, under No Child<br/>Left Behind, and hold the appropriate credentials for the assignment.</p>
<p>13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new employee of the district assigned to a job share shall be hired<br/>inititially on a temporary contract.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will have no more than two job share positions in one academic<br/>year.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall submit a written proposal to the Superintendent or<br/>designee for approval to participate in job sharing. This proposal must be<br/>received on or before March 15<sup>th</sup> prior to the year in which the job sharing<br/>will occur. Unit members shall be informed of the status of their proposal<br/>by April 15*.</p>
<p>13.4 Participants shall be placed appropriately on the unit member’s salary</p>
<p>schedule, receive a prorated portion of the individual’s yearly salary and<br/>paid leaves, and be given appropriate added increments for advanced<br/>certificates.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of job sharing, neither of the job sharing permanent unit<br/>members shall receive credit for a full year of service for the purpose of<br/>advancement on the salary schedule (a half year equals a half year of years<br/>of credit).</p>
<p>13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both job share participants shall be formally evaluated once during the year.</p>
<p>13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both job share participants are mutually responsible to disseminate<br/>information communicated to one participant from faculty or team<br/>meetings.</p>
<p>13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one member of the job share team is absent for any reason, the<br/>remaining team member will take over full-time unless a suitable<br/>replacement is found. When one member substitutes for the other member,<br/>he/she will be paid at the current substitute rate.</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job sharing program does not preclude any employees from receiving a<br/>layoff notice under California Education Code.</p>
<p>13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either member of the job share team voluntarily leaves the job share<br/>assignment, the other member must assume the full assignment until a<br/>suitable replacement has been selected.</p>
<p>13.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Administrator shall approve the calendar and duty assignments of<br/>job share participants including non-teaching duties.</p>
<p>13.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent has the sole discretion to grant or deny a job share team<br/>continuing services the following year. If the Superintendent decides to not<br/>renew a job sharing team, the Superintendent shall notify the team, in<br/>writing, by April 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 14 - LEADERSHIP TEAMS</p>
<p>14.1 Each site will establish Leadership Team. The Leadership Team is an</p>
<p>advisory board, offering suggestions and ideas of how to improve the site<br/>and student learning. The team will be comprised of two teachers and the<br/>site Principal. The group will meet once a trimester, during the academic<br/>year only.</p>
<p>14.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher at the elementary site serving on the Leadership<br/>Team will be volunteering his/her time.</p>
<p>14.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary site the leadership team will be comprised<br/>of teachers who have an extended prep period.</p>
<p>The District and HPTA agree the existing contract that expires June 30, 2013, will be<br/>extended for an additional 3 years and will expire June 30, 2016.</p>

<p>COUNTY</p>
<p>SUPERINTENDENT OF</p>
<p>SCHOOLS</p>
<p>Cary S. Tiinmas, Fd.D., Suprrtntprufent</p>
<p>A partnership between<br/>San Bernardino County California Teachers Associations,<br/>Small School Districts in San Bernardino County<br/>and the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools<br/>May 4, 2000</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In the fall of 1999, the San Bernardino County School District Peer Assistance and Review Task Force, comprised of<br/>district and teacher association members, and staffed by county office personnel, developed PAR model contract<br/>language to support districts as they developed their PAR programs. Upon examining the completed document, small<br/>district superintendents in San Bernardino County, indicated that they would like to have a document that would play<br/>a similar role in supporting the development of a regional small school district PAR consortium. A subcommittee<br/>from the original task force comprised of county office and CAT staff was formed at the request of the small district<br/>superintendents.</p>
<p>The document is the result of the work of that task force and is presented as the PAR program for the small school<br/>district consortium. The following are key components of the consortium:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint Panel will consist of seven members as specified in the consortium document.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first year. Districts will be designated, by lottery, to appoint a teacher or an administrator<br/>representative to the Joint Panel. By lot. one of the districts will select both a teacher and an administrator.<br/>For subsequent years, a rotation system will be established.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participating districts will keep their PAR and mentor funds and maintain their own budgets.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Districts will select their own providers and other eligible support provider candidates and will submit<br/>names, applications, and interview and observation information to the Joint Panel for selection as<br/>Consulting Teachers.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating districts needing consulting teacher services will contract directly with support providing<br/>districts.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating districts receiving consulting teacher services from another district will pay the service<br/>providing district $1,500 per participating teacher. This amount shall be considered full payment for<br/>services rendered.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home district of the Joint Panel Chairperson will provide administrative support for Joint Panel<br/>activities.</p>
<p>Individual district/associationMOUs (page 11) will need to be signed by parties in participating districts establishing<br/>this consortium as the district's negotiated PAR agreement.</p>
