<p>10</p>
<p>grievance. The supervisor shall have ten days to submit a written response to<br/>the grievant.</p>

The appeal shall include a copy of the original<br/>grievance from Level I and a clear, concise statement of reasons for the appeal.<br/>On receiving this formal grievance, the Deputy Superintendent, or his/her<br/>designee shall meet with the grievant, if requested by the grievant, in an effort<br/>to resolve the grievance. The Deputy Superintendent shall provide a written<br/>response to the grievant within five days.</p>

The Association<br/>then has ten days to request that the Deputy Superintendent, or his/her designee,<br/>jointly initiate the process outlined below.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arbitrator shall be selected from a panel of names provided by the<br/>State Conciliation Service. After drawing lots to determine the party<br/>making the first strike, the parties shall alternately strike a name until<br/>one remains. That person shall be the arbitrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to the rules and<br/>procedures of the State Conciliation Service or the voluntary rules for<br/>labor arbitration of the American Arbitrators Association as appropriate.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties<br/>of this agreement unless overruled by the County Superintendent of<br/>Schools.</p>
<p>Cost of Arbitration and Mediation</p>
<p>In all arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator’s or mediator’s fees and expenses<br/>shall be paid fifty percent by the Association and fifty percent by the County <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>11</p>
