<p>ARTICLE VII: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>7.1 General Provisions</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>2013-2014</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the procedure is to attempt to secure equitable solutions<br/>to grievances. All parties agree that these proceedings should be kept<br/>informal and confidential, and that the grievant and immediate supervisor<br/>should attempt to resolve the grievance at the informal level.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the<br/>Board to proceed in carrying out its management responsibilities subject<br/>to the final decision of the grievance.</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herein will be construed as limiting the right of any</p>
<p>grievant to discuss a grievance informally with his/her immediate<br/>supervisor or to have the grievance adjusted, prior to Step 4, without<br/>intervention of the Association, provided that the adjustment is not<br/>inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. If a grievant resolves a<br/>grievance at steps 1, 2, or 3 without the assistance or intervention of the<br/>Association, the Association shall be provided a summary of the<br/>grievance and the resolution and the Association may submit a written<br/>response to the District regarding the grievance resolution. However, the<br/>grievance will be deemed resolved upon the agreement of the grievant<br/>and the District, unless it violates the terms of this agreement. Such an<br/>agreement shall be non-precedential and shall constitute a settlement<br/>only of the grievance.</p>
<p>7.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a grievance shall not reflect unfavorably upon the grievant, or<br/>upon the supervisor with whom it may be filed.</p>
<p>7.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant shall have the right to request the presence of other<br/>employees who are material witnesses at any step of this process as is<br/>reasonably necessary to explain or resolve the grievance. These names<br/>shall be made available to both parties upon request. Such witnesses<br/>shall be in addition to the conferee that either party may select.</p>
<p>7.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a specific time period is provided for administrative decisions at</p>
<p>each level of the grievance procedure, it is recognized that multiple<br/>grievance claims must be processed in a sequential manner.<br/>Consequently, at each level of the procedure, grievance claims shall be<br/>assigned consecutive numbers, based upon the time and date on which<br/>written grievances are received. Administrative personnel shall process<br/>such numbered grievances in a sequential manner, following a pattern</p>
<p>LTA/LUSD</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>2013-2014</p>
<p>that first filed will be first considered. Regardless of specific time periods<br/>provided for decisions at the various levels of this procedure,<br/>administrative personnel shall not be required to consider more than one<br/>grievance claim per day.</p>
<p>7.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the formal requirements stated herein shall be strictly adhered to,</p>
<p>and the time limits indicated at each step shall be considered as<br/>maximums. The time limits specified, however, may be extended by<br/>mutual written consent of the parties. The failure by the District to meet a<br/>deadline set forth in this Article shall provide the grievant the right to<br/>proceed to the next grievance step. The failure of a grievant, or the<br/>exclusive representative on behalf of the grievant, to adhere to the time<br/>limits set forth in this Article shall terminate the grievance and constitute a<br/>waiver of the grievance. As such, the grievance shall be deemed resolved<br/>at that step and shall not be grievable or arbitrable nor shall the grievant<br/>be entitled to re-file further grievances on the same incident(s).</p>
<p>7.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identical grievance claims, the District may elect to hear</p>
<p>only the first written grievance filed. When the decision is rendered, it<br/>shall be applicable to all claims on the same issue arising from the same<br/>set of circumstances.</p>
<p>7.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreement of the Association and the Superintendent, a</p>
<p>grievance may be taken directly to arbitration.</p>
<p>7.1.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be filed regarding the following:</p>
<p>7.1.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandatory suspension, discipline or termination of any<br/>permanent or probationary unit member pursuant to<br/>Education Code.</p>
<p>7.1.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure or refusal of the District to rehire or retain in<br/>employment any temporary or probationary unit member.</p>
<p>7.1.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to deny or grant permanent status to a<br/>probationary employee.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Records of Decision</p>
<p>A copy of the written decision of an arbitrator shall be given to the District and to the</p>
<p>Association for disposition.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release Time</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>2013-2014</p>
<p>All preparation, filing, investigation, processing, hearing (and arbitration) of grievances<br/>shall be conducted during the non-working time of all involved employees, and no<br/>release time shall be provided, except for the actual hearing, should it occur during the<br/>school day. Only necessary personnel will be released at such time. Such release time<br/>shall not be granted for such purposes without the express, prior, written permission of<br/>the superintendent/designee.</p>
<p>7.4 Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ONE</p>
<p>The teacher shall meet with the immediate supervisor or designee to<br/>discuss the potential grievance, in an attempt to resolve it informally. The<br/>teacher and/or the immediate supervisor may bring a conferee to this<br/>informal meeting. If the potential grievance is not resolved at this level,<br/>the grievance shall be presented in writing using the grievance form<br/>within thirty (30) days of the occurrence that gave rise to the grievance.<br/>The written grievance must include the specific action and events alleged<br/>to violate this Agreement and the article(s) violated; the steps taken to<br/>resolve differences through informal means; and the specific steps the<br/>grievant recommends the District take to remedy he grievance. The<br/>supervisor shall respond in writing to a written grievance within five (5)<br/>days thereafter and shall forward a copy to the Association and to the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TWO</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the response in Step One, or if no<br/>disposition has occurred pursuant to the provisions of Step One, within<br/>five (5) days thereafter the written grievance may be presented to the<br/>District Superintendent. The Superintendent shall, upon request, meet<br/>promptly with the grievant, during regular business hours, to discuss the<br/>grievance, and shall respond in writing to the grievant within seven (7)<br/>days of receipt of the grievance appeal.</p>
<p>7.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THREE</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition at Step Two or if the<br/>Superintendent has not rendered a decision within the stated time limit,<br/>the grievant may request that the District petition the California State<br/>Conciliation and Mediation service for the assistance of a mediator. The</p>
<p>LTA/LUSD</p>
<p>2013-2014</p>
<p>grievant must do so in writing within five (5) days after the date of the<br/>Superintendent’s disposition or five (5) days after the last date of the time<br/>limit if no response is provided. Upon appointment of a mediator,<br/>mediation shall be scheduled according to availability of the mediator and<br/>the parties. However, unless mutually agreed upon by the parties,<br/>mediation shall not proceed beyond one full day. If the grievance is<br/>resolved at the mediation, the agreement shall be reduced to writing and<br/>be signed by the parties. Unless stated otherwise, such an agreement<br/>shall be non-precedential and shall constitute a settlement only of the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>7.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOUR</p>
<p>If mediation does not result in the resolution or withdrawal of the<br/>grievance, the Association may submit the grievance to binding<br/>arbitration. This submission must be filed with the District in writing within<br/>fifteen (15) days of the date of the mediation. A copy of the submission<br/>must be received by the District within a fifteen (15) day time limit in order<br/>to be timely. Thereafter, if within ten (10) days of such request, the parties<br/>have not by mutual agreement selected an arbitrator, they shall jointly<br/>request a list of seven (7) potential arbitrators from the California State<br/>Conciliation and Mediation Service. Upon receipt of the list, the parties<br/>shall select an arbitrator by alternate striking of names until one name<br/>remains who shall then serve as arbitrator. Upon appointment of the<br/>arbitrator, the arbitration hearing shall be scheduled according to<br/>availability of the arbitrator and the parties.</p>

Only<br/>after first determining any issues relating to arbitrability of<br/>the grievance shall schedule and conduct a hearing on the<br/>merits and consider evidence and arguments pertaining to<br/>the grievance(s).</p>
<p>7.4.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the close of the hearing and presentation of briefs if<br/>applicable, the arbitrator shall submit a written decision</p>
<p>LTA/LUSD</p>

<p>2013-2014</p>
<p>which sets forth findings of fact, reasoning, and<br/>conclusions on the precise issue(s) submitted. The<br/>arbitrator’s determination shall state whether the grievance<br/>is approved or denied and if approved, the proper remedy,<br/>and the basis for such remedy. The decision of the<br/>arbitrator will be final and binding. The arbitrator’s decision<br/>shall be limited solely to the interpretation and application<br/>of this Agreement to the precise issue(s) submitted for<br/>arbitration. Under no circumstances shall any remedy<br/>include compensatory damages, or attorney’[s fees or<br/>costs of proceedings. The arbitrator will be without power<br/>or authority to make any decision which requires the<br/>commission of an act prohibited b law or which is in<br/>violation of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.4.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally for one</p>
<p>(1) arbitration per school year and thereafter borne solely<br/>by the losing party.</p>
