<p>Article VI</p>
<p>Salaries, Advancement on the Salary Schedule,</p>
<p>Health and Welfare Benefits, and Use of Personal Automobile</p>
<p>A. 1. The payroll period shall be defined as monthly, beginning with September 1,<br/>unless previously contracted on a twelve (12) month basis. Salary payments<br/>shall be made not later than the last day of each month.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall be placed on the appropriate Column of the salary schedule in<br/>accordance with the degree and advanced preparation they have completed.<br/>Compensation for part-time employment shall be calculated upon a percentage<br/>of minutes at a school site required of full-time employees. Teaching time,<br/>preparation period, and passing period shall be included in the total number of<br/>school site minutes designated by the District for both full-time and part-time<br/>employment. School site time required before and after school shall be included<br/>in the total number of minutes designated by the District for full-time employment<br/>only. Lunchtime shall be excluded from both calculations.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial placement on the salary schedule shall be automatically granted<br/>according to prior experience up to five (5) years. The District may grant more<br/>than five (5) years for prior experience in cases where the District finds that to be<br/>appropriate. Advancement on the salary schedule shall be at the rate of one<br/>step for each year of teaching experience. If a teacher is employed full-time for<br/>more than one semester of a school year, he/she shall be given credit for the<br/>year's experience for salary schedule advancement purposes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who works 50% or more in a school year shall be entitled to move<br/>on the step and column as a full-time employee. For each step and column<br/>movement, teachers who work less than 50% on a given year must work two<br/>years or more until the sum of their annual % equals or exceeds 50%.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarter units are converted to semester units by multiplying the quarter units<br/>by two-thirds (2/3). If this calculation results in a fraction, the fraction will be<br/>rounded to the nearest whole number and the teacher shall be placed on the<br/>appropriate column.</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each teacher a statement of the number of units and<br/>credited years upon request.</p>

<p>B. Advancement on the Salary Schedule</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College and University Course Work</p>
<p>When a teacher desires to take courses for credit for advancement on the salary<br/>schedule, he/she must submit the course title and its relation to the scope of the<br/>District curriculum to his/her principal. Should the principal deem the course<br/>unacceptable, he/she would refer it to the Director of Curriculum and Instruction.<br/>The Director of Curriculum and Instruction would then call a meeting of the<br/>Professional Growth Committee. The Professional Growth Committee will be<br/>comprised as follows: one administrator, one teacher appointed by the<br/>Governing Board, and two teachers appointed by the Moraga Teachers<br/>Association. The Committee will review the course and decide if it is acceptable.<br/>Professional advancement categories include the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses which develop increased competence in the present teaching<br/>area.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses which are preparation for a teacher who changes, or plans to<br/>change, from one curriculum to another.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses which would develop competencies in an additional curriculum<br/>area.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses which may not apply directly to the curriculum taught, but<br/>contribute to the background which the teacher uses to stimulate<br/>students.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All official transcripts of advanced units must be submitted to the District<br/>Office by October 1 to be retroactive to the current school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After October 1<sup>st</sup>, verification of professional growth activities should be<br/>submitted to the District Office by the first of the month. The salary adjustment<br/>will be reflected by the next paycheck.</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District approved inservice training sessions will be evaluated on the basis of<br/>fifteen hours for one unit.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel. A month of travel time is the minimum for which units will be allowed.<br/>The value of the trip should result in the development of materials (slides,<br/>artifacts), language skills, cultural understandings, or in the personal<br/>development of the teacher. Neither distance covered nor time taken is of prime<br/>importance. A comprehensive report of the value of the trip is required. An<br/>outline map giving the itinerary of the trip should be included. Of the 75 units<br/>beyond the B.A. required for maximum salary, only 12 may be earned by travel.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer Travel. For travel with specific educational itinerary (directly<br/>related to classroom activity), up to four units per month will be granted.<br/>The maximum number of units for any trip is six.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Travel. Extended travel may be on a straight leave of<br/>absence. The maximum number of units to be allowed is six.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Activities or Achievement</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Work: Published material or evidence of completed projects<br/>must be submitted. The number of units granted will depend on the value<br/>of the work completed.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Instruction:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private instruction in areas such as art, music or language will<br/>be evaluated on the basis of one unit for fifteen hours. A letter of<br/>verification is required.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit may be granted for experience or employment in<br/>technical, professional, or commercial work resulting in the learning<br/>of new techniques or use of equipment related to the teaching<br/>area. One workweek (approximately forty hours) will equal one<br/>unit. Maximum number of units is six for one summer. A report of<br/>the value of the experience as well as verification of employment is<br/>required.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since credit is to be granted for summer work on the following September's<br/>salary schedule, it will be necessary for the Professional Growth Committee to</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>assign tentative value to the activity to be undertaken. All preplanning for work<br/>to be done during the summer must be in the hands of the Committee by May</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired, or those meeting retirement eligibility, certificated employees who<br/>have been continually enrolled or have a COBRA qualifying event may enroll in<br/>health and welfare and dental plans offered by the District to employees, at their<br/>own expense as provided for in Education Code 7000-7007. This enrollment will<br/>be allowed and enrollment will be continued only if it results in no increased cost<br/>to the District or to non-retired District employees, and only if it continues to be<br/>acceptable to the District's insurance providers.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide benefits offered under this Article to eligible<br/>domestic partners to the same extent that such benefits are offered to spouses.<br/>To establish eligibility, the employee shall submit a copy of his/her domestic<br/>partner certificate showing registration with the California Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Article VII</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preface</p>
<p>Matters not in this Agreement are not within the scope of this procedure. This<br/>Grievance Procedure is and shall be the exclusive procedure for processing grievances.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>A &quot;grievance&quot; is a formal written allegation by a unit member who has been<br/>adversely affected by a violation of the express and specific provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>A “grievant” is one or more unit members of the district covered by the terms of<br/>this Agreement with an alleged grievance. The Association may file on behalf of a<br/>grievant or on its own behalf.</p>
<p>A &quot;day&quot; is a contracted work day for unit members.</p>
<p>The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having immediate<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant who has been designated by the District to adjust<br/>grievances.</p>
<p>&quot;Binding&quot; arbitration means that both the grievant and the District shall abide by<br/>the decision of the arbitrator.</p>
<p>&quot;Advisory&quot; qualifies decisions rendered by an arbitrator as being nonbinding and<br/>noncompulsory on the parties involved. An advisory decision shall be considered a<br/>recommendation which may be followed, modified, or rejected by the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Teachers to Representation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by any<br/>member or representative of the administration or the Board against any aggrieved<br/>person, any party in interest, any member of the Association, or any other participant in<br/>the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by<br/>him/herself, his/her attorney, or, at his/her option, by a representative selected by the<br/>Association. If a teacher is not represented by the Association or its representative, the<br/>Association shall have the right to be present and to state its views at all stages of the<br/>formal level.</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by<br/>an informal conference with the grievant's immediate supervisor. The grievant may<br/>bring a MTA representative to any and all face-to-face conferences with prior<br/>notification to immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I - Within ten (10) days after the grievant is aware of or should have<br/>been aware of the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance,<br/>the grievant must present such grievance in writing on the appropriate form to<br/>the immediate supervisor and present a copy to the President of the Moraga<br/>Teachers Association.</p>
<p>This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the<br/>circumstances involved, the explicit provision of this Agreement alleged to have<br/>been violated, the decision rendered at the informal conference, and the specific<br/>remedy sought. The supervisor shall inform the grievant in writing within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does not respond within the<br/>time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>Within the above time limits, either party may request a personal<br/>conference with the other party.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II - In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I,<br/>the grievant may appeal the decision on the appropriate form to the<br/>Superintendent or designee within ten (10) days. This statement should include<br/>a copy of the original grievance, the decision rendered, and a clear, concise<br/>statement of the reasons for the appeal.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall communicate a decision to the grievant in<br/>writing within ten (10) days after receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the<br/>Superintendent or designee may request a personal conference within the above<br/>time limits. If the Superintendent or designee does not respond within the time<br/>limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III - In the event that the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at<br/>level II, or if no written decision has been rendered by the<br/>Superintendent/designee within the prescribed ten (10) day period, the grievant<br/>may within ten (10) days submit a written request to the Superintendent for<br/>conciliation of the grievance. Upon receipt of a timely request, the<br/>Superintendent will request the California Conciliation Service to provide a<br/>conciliator to assist the parties in resolving the grievance. If no conciliator is<br/>assigned within ten (10) days of the Superintendent's request, then the grievant<br/>may proceed to Level IV. The conciliator shall not make written or public<br/>recommendations relative to the grievance. The conciliator shall attempt to<br/>resolve the grievance within twenty (20) days of his/her appointment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV - In the event the conciliation process has not resolved the grievance<br/>within the twenty (20) days, the grievant may within five (5) days submit a<br/>request in writing to the Association for arbitration of the dispute. A copy of the<br/>request will be simultaneously submitted to the Superintendent. As soon as<br/>possible and in any event no later than ten (10) working days after the District<br/>receives written notice of the Association's desire to arbitrate, the parties shall<br/>agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement is reached within said ten (10) days,<br/>they shall request the State Conciliation Service to supply a panel of five (5)<br/>names of persons experienced in hearing grievances in public schools. Each<br/>party shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The order of<br/>the striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>F. Power of Arbitrator</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered by the arbitrator shall set forth in writing findings of fact,<br/>reasoning, and conclusions on issues submitted.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall be empowered to decide whether a grievance is<br/>arbitrable; however, his/her decisions shall be appealable to the court of law.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages for personal injury.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator may hear and determine only one grievance at a time, unless<br/>the District and Association expressly agree otherwise.</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>5. The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms<br/>of this Agreement, or the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures of<br/>the District.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on<br/>the issue or issues submitted to him/her. If the parties cannot agree upon a statement<br/>of what issues are involved, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the<br/>written grievance and the answers thereto. After a hearing and after both parties have<br/>had an opportunity to make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all<br/>parties his findings and conclusions which shall be binding to the parties. If any<br/>financial award against the District, except for any award for back salaries and fringe<br/>benefits, is in excess of $1,000, his/her decision shall be advisory.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fees and Expenses</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the losing party. All<br/>other expenses, including attorney fees, shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclusions</p>
<p>Neither the Superintendent's judgment, as contained in Article IX, Transfers,<br/>shall be subject to the grievance procedure, nor shall the evaluator's judgment and<br/>recommendations contained in classroom observation reports and formal evaluations,<br/>as referred to in Paragraphs E, F and K of Article VIII, Evaluation Procedures, be<br/>subject to the grievance procedure. Under no circumstances shall this arbitration<br/>procedure be deemed to vest in any person or authority the right to determine the<br/>policies of the District, and the Association agrees that such authority is vested solely in<br/>the Governing Board.</p>

<p>Article VIII</p>
<p>Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every probationary and temporary certificated employee will be formally<br/>evaluated by the administration in writing at least twice each school year. The first<br/>evaluation will take place on or before December 1, and the second evaluation will take<br/>place on or before March 1.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every permanent certificated employee covered under this Agreement will be<br/>formally evaluated by the administration in writing at least every other year. Said<br/>evaluation shall be no later than May 1 of the school year in which the evaluation takes<br/>place.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the end of the seventh school week of the year in which evaluation<br/>is to take place, the evaluator and the certificated employee shall have developed<br/>objectives. The failure to reach agreement on proposed objectives will necessitate that<br/>the evaluator and the certificated employee meet with the Superintendent to mediate<br/>the disagreement.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each formal evaluation shall be preceded by at least two classroom<br/>observations, one of which will be at least twenty (20) minutes in length. Within five (5)<br/>working days the evaluator will comment to the employee relative to the observation<br/>and provide a written copy of the observation evaluation to the employee to be signed<br/>by both the employee and the evaluator.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the formal evaluation, the evaluator will hold a conference<br/>and give the evaluatee a duplicate copy of the completed evaluation report, which is to<br/>be signed by both parties. The signature of the evaluatee shall not imply either<br/>agreement or disagreement with the evaluation report, but an acknowledgment that the<br/>evaluation has taken place and been discussed. If the evaluatee is in disagreement<br/>with the content of the report, he/she may so state in writing within ten (10) days. This<br/>statement will become a permanent part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator will confer with the evaluatee and make specific recommendations<br/>in writing, relative to techniques and procedures for improving deficiencies that were<br/>noted as unsatisfactory on the evaluation report.</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any certificated employee who does not meet District standards in any area on<br/>his/her formal evaluation report shall, as necessary, be formally reevaluated the<br/>following year.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If subsequent remedial action eliminates a rating below &quot;meet District standards&quot;<br/>on the formal evaluation report, the evaluatee may request that the evaluation citing<br/>such deficiencies be removed from his/her file after a period of four (4) years from the<br/>date the deficiencies were judged to be satisfactory.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an evaluator and evaluatee have conferred and recommendations<br/>regarding a rating below &quot;Meets District Standards&quot; have been put in writing, the<br/>Moraga Teachers Association, if requested by the Superintendent, will meet with a<br/>District representative to agree upon two teachers qualified to provide collegial support.<br/>The evaluated teacher will then choose one of the teachers who will counsel and assist<br/>him/her as specified in the plan. The assisting teacher will not be held responsible for<br/>evaluating the assisted teacher. If assistance beyond the regular school day is<br/>required, the assisting teacher will be paid at planning day rates.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of formal evaluations will be distributed by the immediate supervisor as<br/>follows:</p>

<p>Article IX<br/>Transfers</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “reassignment” is a change of position and/or classroom at the same<br/>school site.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “voluntary transfer” is a change of position to a new site initiated by the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “involuntary transfer” is a change of position initiated by the<br/>Superintendent/designee, which results in the movement of an employee from<br/>one school site to another.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A principal may reassign an employee to a different position and/or classroom<br/>within the same school.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrators responsible for multi-school programs may reassign<br/>employees depending on program needs.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request a reassignment to a different position within the<br/>same school. It is the principal’s discretion to grant or deny this request.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies within a school will be open first to employees within said school.<br/>Vacancies not filled through reassignment shall be posted and transfer requests<br/>will be considered.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Transfer</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent bargaining unit member may request a voluntary transfer. Any<br/>request shall be made on a “Request for Transfer” form (Appendix E) and sent to<br/>the present site Principal and the District Office.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any known vacancy requiring certification will be sent electronically within ten<br/>(10) days from the time the superintendent declares that the vacancy exists.<br/>During July and August, vacancies will be sent by email, and a copy sent to the<br/>MTA president. Those persons who wish to be notified regarding vacancies<br/>during the summer vacation period shall inform the District office in writing,</p>
<p>MTAF1NA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>indicating the address where notices shall be sent. Notices shall be sent as<br/>vacancies are announced. The employee will notify the District Office of his/her<br/>interest in a vacancy within ten (10) working days of the posting date of the<br/>vacancy. Such vacancies shall not be filled prior to the expiration of the ten (10)<br/>working day period.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall annually survey all certificated staff to determine requests<br/>for site transfer or grade level change for the following year. An employee may<br/>request a voluntary transfer to take effect during the school year or at the<br/>beginning of the next school year. When a vacancy occurs during the school<br/>year, a request for a voluntary transfer to fill that position must be made within<br/>ten (10) days of the posting of the vacancy. If the voluntary transfer of the<br/>personnel involved would cause undue disruption of the existing instructional<br/>program, a long-term substitute may be employed by the District to complete the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fill the position for the ensuing year, all qualified employees submitting a<br/>voluntary “Request for Transfer&quot; form within the ten (10) day notice period will be<br/>considered along with, and in the same manner as, other applicants on the basis<br/>of the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credentials held by the employee:</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the employee’s college subject matter - major(s) and minor(s);</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the professional abilities of the employee for the specific position;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the employee's recent training and experience;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ability to work well with others;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the recommendation of the employee's current supervisor;</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the quality of past service rendered by the employee. If, in the<br/>Superintendent’s judgment, two or more employees appear to be equally<br/>qualified, the decision shall be based upon District-wide seniority. Likewise,<br/>when an employee and an outside candidate have equal qualifications, the<br/>employee shall be given preference.</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>5. If, after due consideration, a voluntary transfer request is denied, the<br/>employee may request the specific reasons. A written response shall be<br/>provided by the Superintendent with the specific reasons for the denial within ten<br/>(10) workdays from the time the request is made.</p>
<p>D. Involuntary Transfer</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent/designee maintains his/her rights to involuntary transfer<br/>certificated employees to positions based upon qualifications, enrollment,<br/>specialized services, opportunities for performance improvement, or other<br/>educationally related needs of the District. Employees being involuntarily<br/>transferred to a different site, shall be provided the reasons, in writing, upon<br/>written request, for such assignment to one of the posted vacancies.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All involuntary transfersmade as a result of reorganization will be<br/>implemented only after consideration of the following non prioritized criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the educational needs and efficient operation of the District;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the qualifications, including recent training, of the employee;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the expressed desires of the employee;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credential requirements;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommendation of involved supervisors;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if “a through e” above are considered equal by the Superintendent, an<br/>employee's length of service with the District shall be the determining<br/>factor;</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;once all involuntary transfers have been completed, section C of this<br/>article shall be applied.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of this article shall be administered by the District in a<br/>manner that is not arbitrary, capricious or illegally discriminatory.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any permanent unit member who is involuntarily reassigned or transferred<br/>shall not be involuntarily reassigned or transferred fora period of two years.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave shall be considered to be earned by personnel at the rate of<br/>one (1) workday per month of service. Sick leave may be accumulated<br/>from year to year indefinitely and may be transferred to the next<br/>employing district at full credit upon the employee's request. Upon<br/>retirement, unused sick leave is credited in computing years of service in<br/>STRS (State Teachers Retirement System).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that employment is terminated prior to the sick leave<br/>having been earned, a refund to the District by the employee in the<br/>amount of the unearned portion will be required. In such cases, the<br/>employee is required to remit to the District at the ratio of the number of<br/>unentitled days used to the number of contract days times the amount of<br/>the full contract.

<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are entitled to use sick leave for disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery<br/>therefrom. Such leave shall not be used for child care, child rearing, or<br/>preparation for child bearing, but shall be limited to those disabilities as<br/>set forth above. The length of such disability leave, including the date on<br/>which the leave shall commence and the date on which the duties are to<br/>be resumed, shall be determined by the employee and the employee's<br/>physician; however, if there is reason to believe that an employee may be<br/>abusing her sick leave, the District may adopt further procedures for<br/>verification.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of official quarantine of the employee's place of residence, the<br/>employee shall be allowed full pay during the period of enforced<br/>quarantine, even though this is greater than the employee's accumulated<br/>sick leave.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each<br/>day of authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity<br/>award.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal<br/>year, the employee shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave<br/>due him/her for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the<br/>employee shall be entitled to the benefits provided in Section A.1., Use of<br/>Sick Leave, in this Article. For the purposes of each of these benefits,<br/>his/her absence shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of<br/>termination of the industrial accident or illness leave.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the employee may endorse to the<br/>District the temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of<br/>his/her industrial accident or illness.

<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee receiving benefits as a result of this section shall, during<br/>periods of injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless the<br/>Governing Board authorizes travel outside the state.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher shall be deemed to have recovered from an industrial<br/>accident or illness, and thereby able to return to work, at such time as<br/>he/she and his/her physician agree that there has been such a recovery. <sup>30</sup></p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee may donate sick leave credits unless they have a<br/>minimum of fifteen days of accumulated leave credits and may donate<br/>only days in excess of fifteen days.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are only entitled to catastrophic leave when eligible leave<br/>credits have been donated to the sick leave bank.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care for the employee’s child, spouse, or parent with a serious health<br/>condition;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s own serious health condition that keeps the employee<br/>from performing his/her job function.</p>
<p>d) Advance Notice of Leave and Medical Certification</p>
<p>Employees will provide (1) advance written notice of the leave request<br/>and (2) medical certification whenever a serious health condition is<br/>involved.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the need for the leave is foreseeable, employees will provide<br/>thirty-day (30) advance written notice. If the need for the leave is<br/>unforeseen (i.e., an emergency), notice is required to be given as soon as<br/>practicable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave is to care for a child, spouse or parent with a serious<br/>health condition, or because of the employee’s own serious health<br/>condition, the employee will provide medical certification from a health<br/>care provider or physician. The medical certification must include:</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a second and third medical opinion<br/>regarding an employee’s serious health condition at the District’s expense.<br/>If the original leave granted is less than twelve (12) weeks, leave may be<br/>extended up to the twelve (12) week maximum only with additional<br/>medical certification.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave is needed for planned medical treatment or supervision,<br/>the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment or</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>supervision to minimize disruptions to the District, outside of working<br/>hours whenever possible.</p>
<p>5. An employee’s advance notice and medical certification may be<br/>required to be given to the Personnel Office. The Personnel Office will<br/>then determine the adequacy of the notice and medical certification and<br/>whether or not the leave will be approved/recommended for approval.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation of Health Coverage and Other Job Benefit Plans</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee taking leave will continue to participate in any group<br/>health care benefits plan under the same terms and conditions, including<br/>any necessary co-payments, in which the employee was enrolled prior to<br/>the first day of the leave. Co-payments are due monthly. Failure to pay<br/>the premium within thirty (30) days of the due date may result in<br/>termination of benefits coverage.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee fails to return from the leave for any reason other<br/>than the recurrence, continuance, or onset of a serious health condition,<br/>the employee will be liable to the District for premiums paid for<br/>maintaining the employee’s health coverage.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth or placement of a child;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever it is medically necessary to care for a family member<br/>with a serious health condition, or because the employee is seriously ill<br/>and unable to work the employee’s regular work schedule.</p>
<p>g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitution of Paid Leave and Other Leave Requests</p>
<p>MTAFINA 2014-17 Final</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees must use paid leave and family care leave concurrently<br/>if the reason for the paid leave meets the requirements of the Section 10</p>
<p>(c) (reasons for taking leave);</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any paid or unpaid leave taken which meets the requirements of<br/>Section 10 (c) will be counted as part of the employee’s family care leave<br/>entitlement.</p>
<p>h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity</p>
<p>Women on maternity leave will not start using family care leave until their<br/>disability period is over (i.e., when their physician takes them off disability after<br/>the birth of their child). Thus, although family leave due to an employee’s serious<br/>health condition would normally run concurrently with sick leave where the<br/>employee is out for three (3) days or more, this will not apply in the case of<br/>disability due to maternity.</p>
<p>i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouses Who Work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District</p>
<p>Spouses employed by the District are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12<br/>workweeks of family leave for the birth or placement of a child with them. There<br/>is no limitation of entitlement for leaves taken for the serious health condition of<br/>their child.</p>

<p>k) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority Employee Benefits and Break in Service</p>
<p>An employee on leave will not lose any seniority or employment benefits that<br/>accrued prior to the start of the leave. An employee on unpaid Family Medical<br/>Leave (not paid leave such as vacation or sick leave) will not accrue additional<br/>benefits, such as vacation, sick leave or similar benefits, during the leave. The<br/>leave will not constitute a break in service for purposes of longevity and seniority.</p>
<p>l) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoration of Employment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitness for Duty Report</p>
<p>Employees returning from an approved leave will be reinstated to the same or<br/>equivalent position. Employees returning from an approved medical leave for<br/>their own serious health condition may be required to provide a fitness for duty</p>

<p>A personal leave of absence without pay may be granted by the Superintendent<br/>for periods of up to ten (10) days. Such leave shall not be granted for vacation,<br/>recreation, Association related or social activities.
