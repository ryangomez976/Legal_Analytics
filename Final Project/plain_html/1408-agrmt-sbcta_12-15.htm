<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>This is an Agreement made and entered into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540-<br/>3549 of the Government Code between the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools<br/>(hereinafter referred to as “County”) and the San Bernardino County Teachers’ Association, an<br/>affiliate of the California Teachers’ Association, and the National Education Association<br/>(hereinafter referred to as “Association”). This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect<br/>from July 1, 2012 up to and including June 30, 2015. Although we will continue an open and<br/>ongoing negotiation process, both parties agree to notify each other no later than March 1, 2015<br/>to begin negotiations on a successor agreement.</p>
<p>Article 1; RECOGNITION</p>
<p>The County confirms its recognition of the Association as the exclusive representative<br/>from that unit of employees recognized by the County per its Resolution dated May 10, 1976 and<br/>subsequent amendments.</p>
<p>Article 2; COUNTY RIGHTS</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to paragraph 2.2 herein below, it is understood and agreed that the County<br/>retains all of its powers and authority to direct, manage, and control to the full extent of the law.<br/>Included in, but not limited to, those duties and powers are the right to: determine its<br/>organization; direct the work of its employees; determine the times and hours of operation;<br/>determine the kinds and levels of services to be provided, and the methods and means of<br/>providing them; establish its educational policies, goals, and objectives; insure the rights and<br/>educational opportunities of students; determine staffing patterns; determine the number and<br/>kinds of personnel required; maintain the efficiency of County operations; determine the<br/>curriculum; build, move, or modify facilities; establish budget procedures and determine<br/>budgetary allocation; determine the methods of raising revenue; contract out work; and take<br/>action on any matter in the event of an emergency. In addition, the County retains the right to<br/>hire, classify, assign, evaluate, promote, terminate, and discipline employees for just cause as set<br/>forth in Education Code.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of the foregoing powers, rights, authority, duties, and responsibilities<br/>by the County; the adoption of policies, rules, regulations, and practices in furtherance thereof;</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith; shall be limited only by the<br/>specific and express terms of this Agreement, and then only to the extent such specific and<br/>express terms are in conformance with law, and further limited by its obligation to consult with<br/>the Association according to the Education Employment Regulations Act upon specific request<br/>of the Association.</p>
<p>2.3 The County retains its right to temporarily suspend any provisions referred to in<br/>this Agreement that are affected by an emergency for the duration of the emergency.

<p>Article 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>A “grievance” is a formal written allegation by one or more unit members or the<br/>Association alleging a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>A “day” is a day in which the grievant is scheduled to work. The “immediate<br/>principal/supervisor” is the lowest level administrator having immediate jurisdiction over the<br/>grievant who has been designated by the County to resolve grievances.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an<br/>informal conference with the grievant’s immediate supervisor. The grievant may have a<br/>representative from the Association if he/she so desires.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level</p>
<p>3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I</p>
<p>The grievant must present such grievance in writing on the appropriate form,<br/>provided by SBCTA, to the immediate supervisor within thirty (30) working days of the time the<br/>grievant knew, or should have knowledge, of the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall communicate a decision to the employee in writing within<br/>ten (10) working days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does not respond within the<br/>time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level. Within the above time limits, either party<br/>may request a personal conference with the other party.</p>
<p>3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the grievant<br/>may appeal the decision on the appropriate form to the Assistant Superintendent, Student<br/>Services or designee. This is to be accomplished within ten (10) working days of the receipt of<br/>the grievance decision from Level I.</p>
<p>The Assistant Superintendent, Student Services or designee shall communicate a<br/>decision within ten (10) working days after receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the<br/>management representative may request a personal conference within the above time limits. If<br/>the management representative does not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal<br/>to the next level.</p>
<p>3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III</p>
<p>In the event the grievance is not resolved in Level II, a written notice of appeal to<br/>Level in shall be served to the County within ten (10) working days following the disposition of<br/>the grievance in Level II. The matter may be submitted to a mediator upon mutual agreement<br/>between the County and the grievant. Such an agreement shall be reached within ten (10)<br/>working days. If no such agreement is reached within ten (10) working days, the County or the<br/>grievant may take the grievance to Level IV. If there is mutual agreement, a facilitator/mediator<br/>will be utilized to assist in the communication between the grievant and the County. This<br/>individual shall be selected from the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service<br/>(CSMCS). The role of the facilitator is to enhance communication and provide alternative<br/>means of dealing with the grievance. The work of the facilitator is non-binding on either party.</p>
<p>3.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV</p>
<p>If not satisfied with the outcome at Level III, the grievant may appeal to Level IV<br/>on the appropriate form to the County Superintendent within ten (10) working days from the date<br/>of mediation in Level III. The County Superintendent or designee shall communicate in writing<br/>a decision within ten (10) working days after receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the<br/>County Superintendent or designee may request a personal conference within the above time<br/>limits.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant shall be entitled to have any person of the grievant’s choice present<br/>during any step of this procedure to act as a representative within the limitations as set forth in<br/>Article 10, Association Rights.</p>
<p>3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from a decision on the part of the County management at a<br/>level above Level I, the grievant may submit such grievance in writing to the appropriate level at<br/>which the alleged decision was made.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to file a grievance, or to appeal from one level to another, within the time<br/>limitations specified herein shall constitute a waiver of the grievance, and the grievant shall be<br/>barred from pursuing the matter further under this Article. The time limits specified should be<br/>considered to be maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time<br/>limits, however, may be extended by mutual written agreement.</p>
<p>3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by any member or<br/>representative of the County against any grievant, any party of interest, any member of the<br/>Association or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by<br/>himself/herself or, at his/her option, by a representative of the Association. If a unit member is<br/>not represented by the Association or its representative, the Association shall have the right to be<br/>present and to state its views at all stages of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>Article 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be paid according to attached Appendix A and/or current<br/>Memorandum’s of Understanding (MOUs) as mutually negotiated.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be provided health and welfare benefits according to attached<br/>Appendix B and/or current MOUs as mutually negotiated.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the supervisor’s approval, when a unit member takes another unit member’s<br/>entire student load/caseload for a half or full instructional day due to the unavailability of a<br/>substitute the unit member shall be entitled to the amount of money that would have been paid<br/>the substitute. When, in this circumstance, a class of students is divided into two parts, each unit<br/>member shall be entitled to one half of the amount of money that would have been paid to the<br/>substitute. In the event that the class is divided into three parts, each unit member will be<br/>entitled to one third of the amount of money that would have been paid to a substitute. The<br/>distribution of payment will not be greater than stated in this section.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members employed as Speech and Language Pathologist (SLP) may request<br/>reimbursement for actual costs incurred by the unit member for annual required fees for the<br/>Certificate of Clinical Competence, and/or license fees for the Audiology Hearing Aid Dispenser<br/>Board, and/or CASHA membership dues up to a maximum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500)<br/>annually. Continuing education credits pertaining to this article are not eligible for<br/>reimbursement. Unit members accepting reimbursement shall submit Medi-Cal billing on behalf</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>of the Superintendent for speech therapy services for eligible special education students on<br/>his/her assigned caseload, in addition to billing for assessment services to students.</p>
<p>Article 5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOURS</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members employed in special education settings including teachers and<br/>school nurses, shall be at the assigned work location and responsible for assigned duties for<br/>seven and one-quarter (7 Vi) hours per day, inclusive of lunch. Unit members employed in<br/>alternative education settings including Juvenile Court Schools, County Community Schools,<br/>Community Day Schools, or as contract teachers in Independent Alternative Education (IAE)<br/>shall be at the assigned work location and responsible for duties for seven (7) hours per day,<br/>inclusive of lunch. In addition, unit members employed in State Preschool Programs shall be at<br/>the assigned work location and responsible for duties for eight (8) hours per day, inclusive of<br/>lunch.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are responsible for other duties which include, but are not limited<br/>to, program development, in-service activities, parent conferences, committee assignments,<br/>faculty and District meetings, special help to student(s). Parent Teacher Association (PTA),<br/>Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) and Open House, Individual Education Plan (IEP) team<br/>meetings, student supervision, and other assignments which are determined by the County to be<br/>necessary for the efficient operation of the County. The County will make every effort to ensure<br/>that duties required of a unit member beyond the workday will be distributed on a reasonable and<br/>equitable basis.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County will ensure a minimum of a thirty-minute duty-free lunch as provided</p>
<p>by law.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of scheduled workdays for unit members employed in: (a) Special<br/>Education, Community Schools and Community Day Schools shall be 182 days with no more<br/>than 180 days of student contact (b) Juvenile Court Schools Specialized Academic Instructors<br/>shall be 219 with no more than 217 days of student contact, and (c) State Preschool shall be 182<br/>days with no more than 180 days of student contact.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County has primary responsibility in developing a calendar. The County<br/>recognizes the Association’s right to meet and collaborate on the distribution of workdays,<br/>including the starting and ending dates.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have a minimum of thirty (30) minutes of preparation time<br/>each day except when, in the judgment of the County, daily safety conditions or transportation</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>schedules preclude such preparation time. It is agreed that unit member’s student contact time<br/>may vary from year to year; however, the County is required to provide preparation time as<br/>noted above.</p>
<p>5.7 Whenever possible, the County shall schedule I.E.P. meetings during the unit<br/>member’s workday as defined in Articles 5.1 and 5.2 of the contract. If the unit member is<br/>required to be away from class, the County, whenever possible, shall attempt to secure a<br/>substitute teacher during that time. Anticipated dates for I.E.P. meetings shall be established by<br/>the County at least one month in advance, except where legal requirements or local policy dictate<br/>a shorter timeline. The County agrees to notify the involved unit member of rescheduling to a<br/>later date from the established target dates of any I.E.P. meetings.</p>
<p>Article 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSIGNMENT.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRANSFER AND FILLING OF VACANCIES</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>“Program” shall refer to the classification, age, and handicapping condition of students,<br/>and credentialing requirements.</p>
<p>“Transfer” shall refer to any change in the program of a unit member. For itinerant<br/>teachers, transfer shall refer to any change in the program or region of a unit member.</p>
<p>“Assignment” shall refer to the school, program, hours, percentage of time, and<br/>beginning date of service for the school year.</p>
<p>“Voluntary Transfer” shall refer to a change in the program of a unit member upon<br/>direction of the unit member. Candidate selection for voluntary transfers shall be based on the<br/>considerations listed in Section 6.5, Transfer Considerations.</p>
<p>“Involuntary Transfer” shall refer to a change in the program of a unit member upon<br/>request of the County. Involuntary transfers shall be made based upon the considerations listed<br/>in Section 6.5, Transfer Considerations.</p>
<p>“Vacancy” shall refer to a position that is open due to resignation, transfer, or newly<br/>created position.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County shall make preliminary assignments prior to the start of the ensuing<br/>school year as early as is feasible. Such assignments shall consist of the school, program, hours,<br/>percentage of time, and beginning date of service for the school year. Nothing in the preliminary<br/>assignment shall be construed as limiting the right of the County from making any changes in<br/>assignments or programs at any time during the school year.</p>
<p>6.3 Voluntary Transfers</p>
<p>The county will provide all unit members the opportunity to give notice of his/her interest<br/>in transferring to another position should a vacancy occur. Notice will be given via email<br/>through the San Bernardino County email system indicating the vacant position and a link to the<br/>EDJOIN web site where the position will be posted. As vacancies occur, the Human Resources<br/>Office will post the position on EDJOIN for five (5) working days to give unit members the<br/>opportunity to show interest. Unit members shall submit to the Human Resources Office via the<br/>EDJOIN web site a completed application for each position indicating his/her interest in<br/>transferring. Consideration will be given to all unit members who have indicated an interest in<br/>the vacant position. In the event that no unit members have indicated an interest or none are<br/>selected following the consideration process the position will be filled by reassignment or<br/>recruitment from outside candidates.</p>
<p>In the event that any vacancy attracts a significant number of transfer requests the Human<br/>Resources Office may establish a “paper screening” process to narrow the transfer candidates to<br/>a reasonable number. This process will not apply to openings or vacancies that arise as part of<br/>preliminary assignments made between June 1 and September 15 as described in 6.2. If the<br/>opening and assignment would result in a change of pay, this position should be flown.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers may be initiated by the County at any time pursuant<br/>to Section 6.5 below.</p>
<p>6.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member affected by such transfer shall be given written notice as<br/>soon as administratively attainable and, when possible, a conference will be held between the<br/>appropriate management person and the unit member to discuss the reasons for the transfer.</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, the County shall avoid transferring unit members<br/>more than twice per year from one school site to another. Should a unit member be transferred<br/>from one school site to another more than twice a year, consideration shall be given to such unit<br/>member when applying for a vacancy within that year under Section 6.5 herein above. Transfers<br/>made under this section shall not be punitive.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer Considerations</p>
<p>In selecting unit members for transfer, the County shall apply, but not be limited to, the<br/>following considerations: Credentials, level and degree of training and experience, special</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>interests and strengths, length of service in the County, geography of the county, and program<br/>needs. The application of these considerations and the final selection shall be within the<br/>discretion of the County.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County will meet with a unit member upon request to discuss rejection of a<br/>unit member’s application for internal transfer.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Teaching Assignments</p>
<p>6.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shared Teaching Assignment Program is a plan whereby two (2)<br/>regular contract teachers share the full responsibilities and the contract of employment of one (1)<br/>identifiable full time equivalent (FTE) teaching position.</p>
<p>6.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interested teachers must seek another teacher who wishes to participate in<br/>a shared teaching assignment. Participants must be tenured teachers, with overall satisfactory<br/>evaluations willing to submit a request for assignment in a part-time teaching position in a shared<br/>teaching capacity except as provided below:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second year probationary teachers may be considered if his/her first year<br/>of performance has been satisfactory.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special circumstance situations will be considered on an individual basis<br/>by the Director, Human Resources, for recommendation to the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>6.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential participants shall submit a written proposal to his/her Principal<br/>showing the names of the participants, position affected, the proposed sharing schedule, the<br/>reason for the request and the benefit(s) that will result. Mutual agreement between the two<br/>teachers, the Principal, Area Director, and Human Resources is required before the Plan can be<br/>implemented.</p>
<p>6.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared assignment shall be written for a minimum of one (1) year. Return<br/>to a regular full time position shall be contingent upon:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher requesting return to full time must have an overall satisfactory<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacant position must be available to receive the requesting teacher.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A satisfactory replacement teacher is available to maintain the shared<br/>assignment with the remaining teacher.</p>
<p>6.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary will be on a prorated share of the salary a teacher would earn had<br/>the teacher not elected to exercise the option of a part-time employment. Contributions to the</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) will be based upon the prorated salary actually<br/>earned by the participants.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher in a part-time assignment will not receive credit for a full step<br/>on the salary schedule because the teacher has not worked the requisite<br/>time for such credit.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher participating in a shared assignment shall receive credit for<br/>one (1) year of experience on the salary schedule for each two (2) years of<br/>participation in such an assignment. If only one (1) year is served in a<br/>shared assignment, that partial year shall not be credited toward salary<br/>placement.</p>
<p>6.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher in a shared assignment will receive all contractual leaves on a</p>
<p>prorated basis.</p>
<p>6.7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher sharing an assignment will receive district paid benefits in<br/>the same percentage as his/her contract. The teacher will be charged for the remaining<br/>percentage through payroll deduction.</p>
<p>6.7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher in a shared assignment will be expected to participate in all<br/>professional responsibilities such as, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/faculty meetings and activities,</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public school observances,</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervision of students at school sponsored or approved activities such as<br/>field trips and similar events,</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional meetings,</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/teacher and I.E.P. meetings,</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report card preparation.</p>
<p>6.7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher in a shared assignment is absent, the other party may substitute<br/>for him/her in a regular substitute status at the regular substitute rate. This will require that the<br/>teacher be signed up as a substitute in advance. It does not necessitate that either party agree to<br/>substitute at any other time; however, they may do so if his/her schedule permits.</p>
<p>6.7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared assignment situation can be terminated by the County upon<br/>showing that the termination is in the best interest of the county schools. The assignment-sharing<br/>participants affected shall be given a statement of the reasons for the termination. Upon<br/>termination of the assignment sharing arrangement by the County the participants affected shall<br/>revert to the employment status held prior to the assignment sharing.</p>
<p>6.7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one of the participants in a shared assignment should resign, go on<br/>leave, or return to full-time employment, the position being shared shall be filled by the<br/>remaining participant if he/she so requests.</p>
<p>6.7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of the shared assignment, a request to be reinstated as a<br/>full-time teacher will be handled as a voluntary transfer request.</p>
<p>6.7.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revision or termination of the Shared Teacher Assignment Program will<br/>not modify the status of personnel who entered the program prior to the effective date of the<br/>modification or revision.</p>
<p>6.8 CalSTRS Reduced Workload Program - The Reduced workload Program allows<br/>a unit member to receive full-time service credit while working part-time (at least 50%) for up to<br/>ten years, normally the last ten years before retirement. Should a unit member wish to<br/>participate in the Reduced Workload Program, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>6.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adhere to Section 6.7 above, with the following exceptions: full-time<br/>service credit will be earned by the participating unit member and the County Schools will pay<br/>full-time contributions to California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS). These<br/>contributions will be paid on the full-time eamable salary rather than the actual part-time salary<br/>earned while participating in the program.</p>
<p>6.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be 55 years old or older;</p>
<p>6.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has to have been employed full-time for a minimum of<br/>(10) years performing creditable service;</p>
<p>6.8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has to have been employed full-time performing<br/>creditable service (5) five consecutive years immediately before entering the program;</p>

<p>15.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous information shall not constitute the sole basis for reasonable<br/>suspicion.</p>

<p>Salaries of unit members shall be paid in accordance with the Teachers’ Salary Schedule<br/>established for the current year.</p>
<p>All returning unit members shall be paid in twelve (12) equal payments.</p>
<p>For the first year, newly hired unit members will be paid on a monthly basis determined<br/>by his/her assigned calendar.</p>
<p>Any additional service beyond the assigned contract year required of the unit member<br/>that is comparable in hours and duties to the regular contract day shall be paid at a per diem rate.<br/>Sick leave for these days shall be earned on a pro-rata basis. During extended year/summer<br/>school or additional days beyond the contract year, current and accumulated sick leave can be<br/>used, but extended illness leave (differential pay) may not be used.</p>
<p>Additional service for extended year programs where hours are less than the regular<br/>contract day shall be paid at the unit member’s daily hourly per diem. Sick leave shall be earned<br/>on a pro-rata basis.</p>
<p>SALARY SCHEDULES</p>
<p>Contact Human Resources for current salary schedules. Adjustments to salary schedules<br/>are determined through the negotiations process. To be effective by July 1 of the new fiscal year<br/>(retroactive if mutually agreed are effective upon to the July 1 date) Unit members may contact<br/>Human Resources for current salary schedules.</p>
<p>1. Using the twelve benchmark districts (Apple Valley, Chaffey, Chino, Colton,<br/>Fontana, Ontario-Montclair, Redlands, Rialto, San Bernardino City, Upland, Victor<br/>Valley, Victor Elementary) the annualized percentage adjustments of each district<br/>shall be added together and divided by 12 (or a number which represents the districts<br/>having settled by May 1 of the current school year or other mutually agreed upon<br/>date) to identify an average annualized salary adjustment. If this average plus 0.25%<br/>is greater than the current year cost of living adjustment previously added to the<br/>salary schedules, then the difference will be added to the salary schedules retroactive<br/>to July 1. In the event no salary increase is given by the benchmark districts, no<br/>additional salary adjustment shall be made (including no addition of 0.25%). In the<br/>event there is a negative COLA/salary rollback by the benchmark districts, any salary<br/>schedule adjustments will be discussed in negotiations and mutually agreed upon.</p>

Unit members shall pay for the portion of the premium that is in excess of the<br/>current negotiated dollar amount. Payment from unit members shall be through payroll<br/>deduction.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent will offer medical, dental and vision insurance benefits to unit<br/>members and eligible dependents, and life insurance benefits to unit members hired after June<br/>30<sup>th</sup> who work 50% or more of full-time.

<p>45</p>
<p>Members who meet this criterion may enroll for eligible coverage outside of the open enrollment<br/>period.</p>
<p>G. Benefits for Teachers in Needles/Trona</p>
<p>Effective January 1, 1999, both parties agree to participate in a Medical<br/>Reimbursement Program for unit members that have been assigned to the Needles and Trona<br/>area of the County. This SBCSS Medical Reimbursement Program would reimburse unit<br/>members for out of pocket medical expenses as outlined in the chart below.</p>
<p>To participate in the SBCSS Medical Reimbursement Program, eligible unit<br/>members are required to inform SBCSS if they and/or his/her dependents are covered under any<br/>other medical insurance programs. Unit members are required to submit evidence that they have<br/>met his/her annual deductible and met his/her maximum out-of-pocket expenses for eligible<br/>medical treatments (determined by SBCSS Anthem Blue Cross plans) to participate in the<br/>SBCSS Medical Reimbursement Program.</p>

<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County will make available to all interested unit members an IRC-125<br/>Flexible Benefits program (as long as a carrier will provide same).</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiree Benefits. Retirees have the option of purchasing available health and<br/>welfare benefits from the San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools at a rate set by the<br/>benefit providers plus an administrative fee. This option must be exercised within thirty (30)<br/>days of losing active employee coverage or exhausting COBRA coverage. This option is open to<br/>retirees, his/her spouses and/or the surviving spouses of retired unit members.</p>
<p>Unit members who retire from the County after having reached age 55 and completed ten</p>
<p>(10) consecutive years of full-time service with the County prior to such retirement, may</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>continue to receive existing available medical insurance coverage for the unit member and<br/>spouse only until the unit member reaches age 65 or qualifies for Medicare, whichever comes<br/>first. For purposes of determining eligibility for retiree benefits, participation in the Shared<br/>Teaching Assignment Program (Job Share) does not constitute a break in service. Such retired<br/>unit members must reimburse the County for fifty percent (50%) of the cost of medical insurance<br/>coverage for the employee and seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost for the spouse’s medical<br/>insurance coverage in accordance with the current schedule of premium costs incurred by the<br/>County for such coverage. Should the County not receive such reimbursement by the first of the<br/>month following a covered insurance month (30 day grace period), the County may terminate<br/>such coverage immediately.</p>
<p>The County will accrue all costs necessary to initiate a Medicare program effective<br/>January 1 or July 1 (whichever comes first) following the completion of Division (approximately<br/>12-18 months after the coverage process begins). Division divides the retirement system into two<br/>groups for the purposes of Medicare coverage. The first group consists of those individuals who<br/>elect not to be covered by Medicare. The second group consists of those individuals who elect to<br/>be covered, plus any unit members who were in employment prior to 4/1/86, but who became<br/>eligible for membership in S.T.R.S. after the Division date. All expenses will be calculated as of<br/>July 1 of each year and deducted from the salary calculations in subsequent years as if it were a<br/>salary schedule payment and used in fact finding or as a point of comparison of salary schedules.</p>
