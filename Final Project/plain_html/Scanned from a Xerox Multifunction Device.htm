If, at any time after the ratification of this<br/>Agreement, there should be a loss in assessed valuation of the District and/or a loss in<br/>assessed valuation per pupil of the District, the District may terminate at its discretion any<br/>increase in the salary schedule tor any school year provided by this provision on Salaries.<br/>If the District should determine to terminate any increase in the salary schedule for any<br/>school year provided by this provision, the Association may seek to negotiate any<br/>increase in the salary schedule for that school year.

<p>B. The District in the 2013-2014 school year will contribute up to a maximum of $650 per<br/>full-time employee per month for current coverage for employee only under current<br/>health, dental and life insurance policies. If an eligible employee chooses the available<br/>HMO coverage any savings from not choosing the other available plan may be used by<br/>the employee to pay part of the costs for dental or spousal coverage.</p>
<p>Any increase in Health Benefits for 2013-2014,2014-2015 and/or 2015-2016 is subject to<br/>limited re-opener negotiations during 2013-2014,2014-2015 and/or 2015-2016.</p>
<p>If, in any month after June 30, 2013, the costs exceed the specific maximum contribution<br/>by the District, the amount over the specific maximum contribution will be deducted from</p>
