<p>ARTICLE XI: CUSS SIZES</p>
<p>11.1 District Class Sizes</p>
<p>The provisions of this Agreement are intended to maintain class size at a reasonable and equitable</p>
<p>level. The following provisions shall be effective commencing with the 2013-2014 school year:</p>
<p>11.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Local Control Funding Formula does not go into effect and the District operates Class<br/>Size Reduction (CSR), the program will be operated within State guidelines and Education<br/>Code requirements in effect during each fiscal year. In the event that the Local Control<br/>Funding Formula is enacted or the District elects not to participate in the Class Size<br/>Reduction program, the District will use its good faith efforts to maintain a school-site wide<br/>average maximum class size as follows:</p>
<p>Classes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26:1</p>
<p>1st .3rd &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26:1</p>
<p>4th _ 8th &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32;i</p>
<p>11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students in special education classes who are mainstreamed into the regular classroom will<br/>be counted in that classroom’s enrollment.</p>
<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site principals will make every effort to avoid the creation of a blend. In the event the<br/>creation of a blend cannot be avoided, the site principals will make every effort to lower class<br/>sizes in blended classes. Once the non-blended grade classes at the school reach the<br/>agreed upon class size set forth in Article 11.1, then an additional student could be added to<br/>the blend.</p>
<p>11.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education classes will not exceed legal state maximums unless a State Board of<br/>Education waiver is received.</p>
<p>11.2 Modifications</p>
<p>11.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The listed District class size averages are subject to modification for purposes of:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoidance of blended classes or low enrollment classes;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large group or innovative instruction;</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abrupt changes in enrollment, or;</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other valid reasons as mutually agreed upon by the school staff and principal.</p>
<p>11.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the above modifications (11.2.1) will result in denying the benefits listed in 11.3.1,<br/>unless the modification was initiated by the teacher. For the purposes of this paragraph the<br/>term initiated shall be defined as follows - If a position is posted or created as a result of the<br/>above modifications (11.2.1), it is considered to be initiated by the district. A teacher can<br/>initiate a modification by written notice to the administration.</p>
<p>BTA Agreement</p>
<p>Page 27</p>
<p>11.2.3 At the middle schools, class sizes for non-core classes will be determined by the site principal<br/>given the following criteria:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music class sizes determined in consultation with the music teacher(s).</p>
<p>2) PE will not exceed 45 students. Any modification to the cap of 45 must be mutually<br/>agreed upon by three equal parties being the site P.E. teachers, site staff and site<br/>administration.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elective / Enrichment classes - every effort will be made to not exceed target ADA as<br/>delineated in 11.1.1.</p>
<p>11.3 Exceeding Class Size</p>
<p>11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site principals will make every effort to maintain individual class sizes as noted above in</p>
<p>11.1.1. When the enrollment of any single K-5 class or 6-8 total teacher contact exceeds the<br/>threshold below (22 for K-3 and 33 for 4-5) the teacher shall receive additional planning time<br/>provided the excess enrollment continues for 16 consecutive days or more. Any such planning<br/>time shall be one-half (1/2) day for each student in excess of the stated threshold per trimester.<br/>Teacher may choose to take !4 day in-district teacher substitute rate in lieu of planning time per<br/>Article 17.4.8.1.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-3 Class Size Threshold: Enrollment reaches 21 students (i.e. compensation starts with<br/>the 22<sup>nd</sup> student).</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4-5 Class Size Threshold: Enrollment reaches 32 students, (i.e. compensation starts with<br/>the 33<sup>rd</sup> student).</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6-8 Classes: The class size threshold shall be the daily total student contacts above 31.2<br/>students (31.3 students), times the number of periods taught each day, excluding PE and<br/>music. This threshold will be used except in classes where the teacher and administrator<br/>mutually determine a need for a higher number of students per class (over the threshold).</p>
<p>&gt;Daily number of periods taught (excluding PE and Music) times 31.2 = number of<br/>student contacts per day.</p>
<p>11.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers of 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade classes will receive one day per trimester of certificated assistance<br/>for assessments.</p>

<p>14.3 Evaluation Process/Procedures</p>
<p>14.3.1 Four Point Rubric: Evaluation is a continuing process including, but not limited to, the formal<br/>process outlined in this contract. It is the responsibility of the District to evaluate and assess<br/>employee competency as it reasonably relates to the California/Buckeye Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession, the Education Code, the contract, the teacher's job description, and Board<br/>policy. The evaluation shall include a goal setting process and be based on the following four point<br/>rubric.</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubric&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluated</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory/</p>
<p>Does Not Meet<br/>Standard</p>
<p>Performance is<br/>clearly</p>
<p>unacceptable, does<br/>not meet<br/>standards, and<br/>needs to be<br/>improved<br/>immediately.</p>
<p>Re—evaluation and<br/>professional support<br/>plan are required</p>
<p>Developing/<br/>Professional<br/>Support Needed</p>
<p>Teachers are not<br/>expected to remain at<br/>this level; performance<br/>has deficiencies which<br/>must be addressed.</p>
<p>A professional support<br/>plan will be<br/>implemented to meet<br/>standards (if indicated<br/>above).</p>
<p>Effective/</p>
<p>Proficient</p>
<p>Describes solid,<br/>expected<br/>professional<br/>performance which<br/>meets or exceeds<br/>standards.</p>
<p>Areas for growth<br/>will be identified.</p>
<p>Highly Effective/<br/>Innovating</p>
<p>This level is reserved for<br/>truly outstanding<br/>teaching that meets very<br/>demanding criteria and<br/>exceeds standards.<br/>Includes teacher<br/>leadership at the school<br/>or district level.</p>
<p>Areas for growth will be<br/>identified.</p>
<p>14.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late Hires: Teachers hired after September 1st shall meet with their evaluator within two weeks<br/>to initiate the Evaluation Process.</p>
<p>14.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Evaluation Non-Tenure/Two Year Cycle Tenured Employee: Evaluation and assessment<br/>of the performance of each teacher shall be made on a continuing basis, every year for non-<br/>tenured teachers and at least every two (2) years for tenured teachers with permanent status,<br/>unless the provisions of 14.3.4 apply.</p>
<p>14.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five Year Evaluation Cycle: Permanent teachers who have been employed by the District for at<br/>least ten (10) consecutive years as a teacher who are considered “highly qualified” pursuant to<br/>the regulations under “No Child Left Behind” (20 U.S.C. 7801, et. seq.) and whose most recent</p>
<p>BTA Agreement</p>
<p>Page 70</p>
<p>evaluation ratings have been satisfactory may be evaluated every five (5) years, provided the<br/>teacher and his/her primary evaluator consent. At any time, the teacher or the evaluator may<br/>withdraw consent returning to the “every two (2) years” cycle. The withdrawal of consent shall not<br/>be subject to the grievance /arbitration procedure.</p>
<p>14.4 Goal Setting Process</p>
<p>14.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Responsibility Prior to Goal Setting Conference: Prior to the Goal Setting Conference<br/>the teacher will:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conductthe Self-Assessment on the Continuum of Teaching Practice (Appendix D-3).<br/>(Self-Assessment is not turned in to evaluator.)</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete usm§ the Student Data Analysis and Reflection Form (Appendix D-7). At least<br/>five (5) workdays prior to the goal setting conference, the principal will notify the evaluatee of the<br/>necessary and readily available data to use for analysis. The evaluatee may bring to the goal<br/>setting conference any additional data of their choice.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review identified areas for continuing growth from previous evaluation.</p>
<p>14.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal Setting Conference: At the goal setting conference, the evaluator and teacher shall:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discuss the teacher's reflection on Self-assessment on the Continuum of Teaching<br/>Practice (Appendix D-3).</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discuss how the teacher will use results from the Student Data Analysis and Reflection<br/>Form (Appendix D-7).</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discuss identified areas for continuing growth from previous evaluation.</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the evaluator, the teacher will identify one C/BSTP’s, in addition to Standard 5, to be the<br/>focus of the evaluation. (Appendix D-2 and D-3) The teacher would be evaluated on all<br/>elements contained within the chosen C/BSTP. During the goal setting conference, the<br/>teacher may choose to change the C/BSTP based upon the conversation with the<br/>evaluator. The teacher and evaluator will fill out the Goal Setting Conference Agreement<br/>Form (Appendix D-4)</p>
<p>v. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator and teacher will mutually decide on the type and scope of evidence used to show<br/>that goals have been adequately addressed. Evidence may include: Sample lesson/unit<br/>plans, Student work/ projects, Class rules and procedures, Discipline records,</p>
<p>Professional Learning Communities, Membership in professional organizations, Formal<br/>and informal mentoring, Participation on committees, Technology used, Use of student<br/>learning teams, Materials to promote critical thinking and problem solving, Collaborative<br/>lesson planning, Video tapes of lessons/students performances, Audiotapes of<br/>lessons/student performances, Photographs, Use of professional literature to inform<br/>instruction, Writing professional articles, Data/feedback collected by teacher, Data/feedback<br/>collected by coach/administrator, Artifacts from professional conference, workshops, and<br/>reading, Records of student progress (grade book, charts, graphs, tables) on curricular<br/>goals.</p>
<p>BTA Agreement</p>
<p>Page 71</p>
<p>vi. Every effort should be made to reach agreement on goals and model for evaluation, but In<br/>the event that the teacher and evaluator cannot agree upon goals under subsesction iv.<br/>above, the teacher shall have the final responsibility for choosing the goals. If the teacher<br/>and evaluator cannot agree upon goals, and the teacher’s previous evaluation included a<br/>“Needs Improvement”, “Unsatisfactory” or the teacher has been pulled back into the<br/>evaluation cycle, is on a Remediation Plan or PAR, the evaluator shall have the final<br/>responsibility for choosing goals.</p>
<p>14.5 Observations</p>
<p>14.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Observation Conference: Using the Pre Conference Conversation Questions (Appendix D-5) as a<br/>guide, the teacher and evaluator will discuss and outline a plan for the observation period, including dates<br/>and times for formal observations and the communication and timing of feedback. The Pre Conference<br/>Conversation Questions are meant as suggestions for guiding the conversation; they are not a required list<br/>and written responses are not expected.</p>
<p>14.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Observations</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be two (2) formal observations. These observations shall be scheduled at a mutually<br/>agreed-upon time, and shall be no less than one half-hour and no more than 50 minutes to<br/>ensure full understanding of the lesson's objectives. An administrator shall provide a minimum of<br/>five (5) working days’ notice of any change in the formal observation schedule, but if the<br/>employee elects to hold the observation sooner they may mutually agree with their administrator<br/>to do so.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher shall sign acknowledging receipt of any observation report identified in this<br/>Article, however, such signature does not necessarily constitute agreement with the<br/>contents of the document.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, during the observation period, the evaluator identifies a need for immediate improvement in<br/>an area that was not identified during the goal-setting process, an addendum to the Goal<br/>Setting Conference Agreement Form may be developed (Appendix D-4(A)). An improvement<br/>plan will be developed and discussed, including specific means for assessing improvement<br/>(e.g., an additional formal observation). The teacher will be given an opportunity to attach to<br/>the improvement plan any comments that the teacher may wish to prepare within ten (10)<br/>work days of the discussion.</p>
<p>14.5.3 Post-Observation Conference Timelines/Content</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evaluator is observing the teacher in a cluster (usually three class meetings in a<br/>row), the evaluator shall meet with the teacher within five (5) working days of the last<br/>cluster observation.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evaluator is observing the teacher over an extended period, the evaluator shall<br/>meet with the teacher within five (5) working days of each observation.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the Post Conference Conversation Questions (Appendix D-6) as a guide, the<br/>teacher and evaluator will discuss and reflect upon the observations. The Post</p>
<p>BTA Agreement</p>
<p>Page 72</p>
<p>Conference Conversation Questions are meant as suggestions for guiding the<br/>conversation; they are not a required list, and written responses are not expected.</p>
<p>iv. Based on the observations, the evaluator will identify areas of strength and areas of</p>
<p>needed improvement. If there are not areas identified as needing improvement, then no<br/>written post-observation report is needed. The evaluator shall communicate either<br/>verbally or in an informal manner (i.e., email, etc) a summary of the observation to the<br/>teacher. If there are areas identified as needing improvement/development, then the<br/>evaluator shall identify the concerns and document the same in writing and provide a written<br/>report to the teacher. If areas of immediately-needed improvement are identified, an<br/>additional formal observation will be scheduled to assess improvement. The teacher will<br/>be given an opportunity to attach to the observation report any comments that the<br/>teacher may wish to prepare within ten (10) days of the discussion.</p>
<p>14.5.4 Informal Observations</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of an informal observation is to obtain a candid, unscripted (and possibly brief)<br/>snapshot of the teacher's practice. The district may conduct informal observations as<br/>needed.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An informal observation is any observation that does not require a pre- and post¬<br/>observation conference.</p>
<p>iii. Informal observations may be either scheduled or unscheduled. If a concern,<br/>based upon an informal observation, is reduced to writing, then a conference with the<br/>teacher will be offered and the teacher will be given an opportunity to attach to the<br/>observation report any comments that the teacher may wish to prepare within ten (10)<br/>work days of the discussion.</p>
<p>14.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Observation (Optional)</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the teacher’s discretion, a half-day of release time will be provided to the evaluatee to observe<br/>peers within the district. Opportunities may also be encouraged/provided at the principal’s<br/>discretion.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peer Observation Form (Appendix D-8) is meant as a guide for reflection on what the<br/>teacher might bring to his or her own teaching as a result of observing the peer. This<br/>reflection may be part of the discussion at the Final Evaluation Conference.</p>
<p>14.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Feedback Reflections</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher will administer the Student Survey (Appendix D-9-D11)to all classes (for classroom<br/>teachers) or a reasonable sample of students (for specialists).</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher will read and reflect on completed Student Surveys. The completed surveys are not<br/>shared directly with the administrator.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher will fill out the Student Survey Teacher Reflection Form (Appendix D-12) and share it</p>
<p>BTA Agreement</p>
<p>Page 73</p>
<p>with the evaluator, who will provide &quot;Administrator Response&quot; as appropriate on the form.<br/>This reflection may be part of the discussion at the Final Evaluation Conference.</p>
<p>14.6 Final Evaluation</p>
<p>14.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Report: The final written evaluation report shall be based on the teacher's performance<br/>in the areas of instructional and non-instructional duties, attainment of the agreed-upon curricular<br/>objectives, the teacher’s professional conduct within the scope of his/her assigned responsibilities,<br/>and other provisions of Education Code 44662 (E.C. 44662 - progress of pupils toward the state-<br/>adopted academic Content Standards and the California/Buckeye Union Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession).

<p>APPENDIX H<br/>BUCKEYE UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>CREDENTIAL AUTHORIZATION - TEACHING ASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>One Time Agreement re:</p>
<p>Teaching Assignments Credential Authorization</p>
<p>With California Education Code and requirements set forth by NCLB and the California Commission on<br/>Teacher Credentialing, it is the desire of BUSD that teachers meet credentialing mandates and be placed in<br/>the classrooms that are most suitable for the credential that they possess. This agreement is being offered<br/>as an option for those teachers who are currently teaching in a subject area under a credential authorization<br/>signed by the Board of Trustees. This type of authorization is intended to be a temporary solution to meet<br/>the demands of master scheduling needs at an individual site in a given year only. If a teacher does not wish<br/>to participate in this agreement, the administration will make every attempt to reassign that teacher to their<br/>appropriate credentialed subject area when possible, given the challenges of scheduling.</p>
<p>The intent of this agreement is to give the teachers listed below, a period of time within which they may work<br/>to obtain a credential so that they may remain in a teaching assignment in a subject for which they are<br/>currently under an annual authorization by the Board of Trustees, and show progress towards a plan to<br/>obtain the appropriate certifications.</p>
<p>Effective dates: Agreement is to be signed prior to September 30, 2011, with intent to obtain the needed<br/>credential by June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that the specific coursework needed for each teacher to complete his/her<br/>credential/supplemental will be different. Therefore, any teacher wishing to participate in this<br/>agreement shall complete the following steps:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet with a credential specialist to determine coursework needed</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research options and institutions for obtaining classes</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a tentative plan/timeline to obtain the needed classes within the dates of the<br/>agreement</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review the above information with his/her administrator prior to September 30, 2011</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the work involved in obtaining the certification, the District agrees that the<br/>teachers involved will have the option to bank the units taken as part of their accumulated units<br/>for their next longevity step.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher will have the option to work with the site administrator to adjust the non-student<br/>contact part of the work day in order to attend dasses for the purpose of addressing<br/>credentialing needs.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff meetings are part of the collaboration time.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation time and the collaboration meetings are to be held within the 7 !4 hour workday.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period of this one-year agreement, adjustments will be made to Article III and Article IX<br/>because certain language is affected by an early release schedule. Refer to the articles for specific<br/>changes.</p>
