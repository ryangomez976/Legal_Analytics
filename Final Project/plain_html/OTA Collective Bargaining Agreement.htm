<p>ARTICLE IX &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is an allegation by a grievant that said grievant has been adversely affected by a violation,<br/>misapplication or misinterpretation of the specific provisions of this agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is the person or persons, including the Association or representatives thereof, making the<br/>claim.</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>3. A “party in interest” is any person who might be required to take action, or against whom action might be<br/>taken, in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, equitable solutions<br/>to the problems which may, from time to time, arise affecting the welfare or working conditions of<br/>teachers. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept informal and confidential as may be<br/>appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any unit member having a grievance<br/>to discuss the matter informally with any member of the administration, to enlist the aid of the<br/>Association or a representative in the process, or to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by<br/>the Association, provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement and that<br/>the Association president has been given written dispositions of the adjustment by both parties.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits specified at each<br/>level should be considered maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time<br/>limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in this<br/>grievance procedure by the end of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the<br/>following year, could result in harm to a grievant, the time limits set forth herein shall be reduced so that<br/>the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year, or as soon as possible.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, either in its own behalf or in behalf of the affected teachers, may initiate a grievance<br/>which affects more than one unit member in a single building, or teachers in more than one building at<br/>Level Two.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of the grievance takes place, the grievant shall fulfill or carry out the original<br/>administrative order, requirement or other directive, provided that the District employee issuing the order,<br/>requirement, or other directive, states in writing to the unit member that the request is, in the opinion of<br/>the administration, within the provisions of the Agreement and the law and does not create an unsafe<br/>working condition for the unit member.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member should first discuss a potential grievance with the appropriate Association representative<br/>to determine whether a contract violation has occurred.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: A grievant shall first discuss the grievance with the appropriate principal or immediate<br/>supervisor, either directly or through the Association’s designated grievance representative, with the<br/>objective of resolving the matter informally.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level One, or if no<br/>written or verbal decision has been rendered within five (5) days after the presentation of the grievance,<br/>he/she shall, within ten (10) days thereafter, file the grievance in writing simultaneously with the<br/>president of the Association and the superintendent.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after the receipt of the written grievance by the superintendent, the superintendent or<br/>his/her designee will meet with the grievant and a representative of the Association in an effort to resolve<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at Level Two, or if<br/>no written decision has been rendered within ten (10) days after he/she has first met with the<br/>superintendent or the superintendent’s designee, the Association may request Advisory Arbitration.</p>
<p>Q</p>
<p>4. Level Four - Advisory Arbitration: The grievance procedure is modified, effective July 1, 2001, to<br/>provide advisory arbitration for the entire Collective Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”). The American<br/>Arbitration Association (“AAA”) shall be the provider of lists from which to select arbitrators and all<br/>proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA Voluntary Rules for Labor Arbitration. The<br/>Arbitrator’s decision shall be forwarded to the Board for implementation or rejection. If an award is<br/>rejected, the Association may initiate a court action. Each party shall bear the costs of its own<br/>representation except that the costs of the Arbitrator and the court reporter, if any, shall be borne equally<br/>by the parties.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Teachers to Representation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the superintendent or by any member or representative of the<br/>administration or the board against any grievant, any party in interest, any member of the Association, or<br/>any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be represented at all stages of the grievance by himself/herself, or at his/her option,<br/>by a representative selected by the Association. If a unit member is not represented by the Association or<br/>its representative, the Association shall have the right to be present and to state its views at all stages of<br/>the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the administration at the level<br/>above the principal or immediate superior, the grievant shall submit such grievance in writing to the<br/>superintendent and the Association directly and the processing of such grievance will be commenced at<br/>Level Two. The Association may process, at its own expense, a class action grievance through all levels<br/>of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at Levels One and Two of the grievance procedure will be in writing, setting forth the<br/>decision and the reasons therefore, and will be transmitted promptly to all parties in interest and to the<br/>president of the Association. Time limits for appeal provided in each level shall begin the day following<br/>receipt of the written decision by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative to be designated by the Association to investigate a grievance or<br/>attend a grievance meeting or hearing during the day, he/she will, upon notice to his/her principal or<br/>immediate superior by the president of the Association, be released without loss of pay or leave in order<br/>to participate in the foregoing activities. Any part of the 30 days available for preparation/negotiations<br/>may be used in this area. Any unit member who is requested to appear in such investigations, meetings,<br/>or hearings as a witness will be accorded the same right, with the Board paying 100% of normal<br/>compensation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance will be filed in a<br/>separate grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any one of the participants.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and recommendations, and<br/>other necessary documents will be prepared jointly by the superintendent and the Association and given<br/>appropriate distribution by the Association so as to facilitate operation of the grievance procedure. The<br/>costs of preparing such forms shall be borne by the Board.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any concern not covered in the agreement will be handled through normal line and staff procedures<br/>which would include immediate supervisor, principal, superintendent, and school board, in that order.</p>
<p>The concerned person may enlist the aid of the Association or a representative in that process. These<br/>concerns will not be considered a part of the agreement and, thus, not applicable in the grievance<br/>procedures established in this agreement.</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>ARTICLE X</p>
<p>TEACHER EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Evaluation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary/Temporary Unit Members</p>
<p>Each probationary and/or temporary unit member shall be evaluated on a continuing basis. A formal<br/>evaluation shall be completed each school year. These unit members will also receive interim evaluations<br/>on or before December 1, and on or before February 1.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Unit Members</p>
<p>Each permanent unit member shall be evaluated on a continuing basis. Permanent unit members<br/>performing satisfactorily shall be formally evaluated at least once every other year. Permanent unit<br/>members given a rating of “progress toward standards not evident” in any category on the Formal<br/>Evaluation Summary shall be formally evaluated each school year.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rating of “progress toward standards not evident” in one(l) out of</p>
<p>the first four (4) categories shall be rated “unsatisfactory” overall and referred to the Peer<br/>Assistance and Review (PAR) program (if implemented). In order for the category to be<br/>unsatisfactory overall, a majority of the elements must be marked “progress not evident”.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory Overload: If a significantly greater number of teachers in the first years of<br/>PAR (if implemented) receive an overall rating of unsatisfactory compared to the number<br/>that received an overall unsatisfactory in 1998/1999, the administrator will be asked to<br/>prove that each of this unit members’ teaching behavior has changed dramatically since<br/>their last individual evaluation. This must be done before the teachers begin the PAR<br/>process.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas of Evaluation</p>
<p>The District shall evaluate and assess certificated unit member performance as it reasonably relates to: Pupil<br/>Progress Towards Standards of Expected Achievement: the progress of students toward the Governing<br/>Board’s established standards of expected pupil achievement at each grade level in each area of study; the<br/>Establishment and Maintenance of a Suitable Learning Environment within the scope of the unit member’s<br/>responsibilities; the unit member’s Adherence to Curricular Objectives; the Instructional Techniques and<br/>Strategies used by the unit member; and the performances of non-instructional duties and responsibilities,<br/>including supervisory, participatory and advisory duties.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Publishers’ Norms</p>
<p>The evaluation and assessment of a unit member’s performance pursuant to this Article shall not include the<br/>use of publishers’ norms established by standardized tests.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice to Unit Members</p>
<p>No later than October 1 of the year in which the formal or informal evaluation is to take place, the District<br/>shall give unit members a copy of the evaluation procedures, the criteria upon which the evaluation is to be<br/>based, the Governing Board’s established Standards of Expected Pupil Achievement at each grade level in<br/>each area of study, and the identity of their evaluator. The primary evaluator shall normally be the principal<br/>of the school.</p>
<p>Under special circumstances and for good cause an evaluatee may request an alternate OUSD site<br/>administrator for their primary evaluator. The request is heard and decided upon by the Superintendent. If the<br/>Superintendent’s decision is unsatisfactory to the evaluatee, the evaluatee may appeal the decision to a three-<br/>member panel consisting of one (1) OTA appointee, one (l)District appointee and a third member to be<br/>mutually agreed upon. The decision of the panel shall be final.</p>

<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative Evaluation</p>
<p>The District and the Orland Teachers Association (OTA) share the belief that offering alternatives to the<br/>traditional evaluation system will improve excellence in instruction by promoting the professional growth of<br/>experienced teachers.</p>
<p>1. Participants</p>
<p>The following certificated personnel will be eligible to participate in an alternative evaluation system,</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employees</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voluntary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the permanent certificated unit member with the</p>
<p>approval of the site administrator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no limit on the number of participants at each site.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative evaluation option, if mutually agreed upon, shall take the place of the<br/>traditional evaluation methods as outlined in Article 10 of the Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement</p>
<p>2. Process</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal Setting</p>
<p>The certificated employee will develop goals as the foundation for his/her alternative<br/>evaluation option. During the goal-setting conference, the site administrator and the<br/>certificated employee will:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree on the goals and the selection of the alternative evaluation option.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop timelines for completion.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review how the alternative evaluation option will enhance student learning.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative Evaluation Options</p>
<p>The certificated employee should select alternative evaluation options that are in close<br/>alignment with his/her annual goals. The district-wide approved alternative options are<br/>described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Growth Activities</p>
<p>Individual growth activities are designed to improve the employee’s performance<br/>through the use of selected professional growth activities combined with self-analysis<br/>techniques. Examples of activities in this category are:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video-taping a classroom lesson (self analysis)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portfolio assessments (training, development and use)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self evaluation (formative and summative)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student and parent feedback</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher-created projects</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational Team Growth Activities</p>
<p>These activities are designed to reduce the isolation of the classroom teacher. The<br/>District and the Association agree that an increased level of collaboration contributes to<br/>the professional growth of each employee. Examples of Educational Team Growth<br/>Activities are:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive coaching</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video taped lessons (with peer reviewer)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter/intra disciplinary grade level teams</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative teaching and presentations to staff</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher team created projects</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational Research</p>
<p>The teacher may outline an instructional strategy or learning theory to be researched<br/>and implemented in the classroom. The design of the research and method of</p>
<p>IT</p>
<p>evaluation shall be included in the project. This may be completed in conjunction with<br/>graduate coursework or a District curriculum project.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration</p>
<p>The District and OTA believe the most effective professional growth occurs through<br/>collaboration</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and the site administrator will work together in the selection of the options<br/>and the development of the specific activities.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants in the alternative evaluation option will be encouraged to share the<br/>progress and results of their alternative individual or educational team activities with<br/>other colleagues. The time and format for this collaboration will be developed at each<br/>individual site.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines</p>
<p>The certificated employee will submit a written alternative evaluation plan/goals.<br/>Timelines are to be predetermined by the participants and the site administrator.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Report</p>
<p>Prior to the end of the year, the teacher and administrator will meet to review the progress<br/>of the selected teacher activities. Both the teacher and the administrator will provide a<br/>written response. Upon satisfactory completion of the selected activities, a form<br/>indicating completion of the alternative evaluation plan and meeting District Standards<br/>will be included in the personnel file.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI PROFESSIONAL DUES OR FEES AND PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of the Association, or who has applied for membership, may sign and<br/>deliver to the board an assignment authorizing deduction of unified membership dues, fees, and general<br/>assignments in the Association. Such authorization shall continue in effect from year to year unless revoked<br/>in writing between June 1 and September 1 of any year. Pursuant to such authorization, the Board shall<br/>deduct one tenth of such dues from the regular salary warrant of the unit member each month for ten months.<br/>Deductions for teachers who sign such authorizations after the commencement of the school year shall be<br/>appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon appropriate written authorization from the unit member, the Board shall deduct from the salary of any<br/>unit member and make appropriate remittance for annuities, credit union, savings bonds, charitable donations,<br/>or any other plans or programs jointly approved by the Association and the Board. Changes in salary<br/>deductions, with the exception of W-4 changes, for the school year may be made at the unit member’s option<br/>between July 1 and October 1 of any school year.</p>
<p>Exceptions to be made only in case of emergency. All Association dues and representation fees not assigned<br/>to payroll deduction by October 1 shall be paid to the Orland Teachers’ Association by December 31, in full.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees covered by this agreement who are not members shall, as a condition of continued employment,<br/>pay to the Orland Teachers’ Association a representation fee equivalent to 100% of the total Association dues<br/>(OTA, CTA, NEA).</p>
<p>Payment may be made by payroll deduction as per Article XI (A), or by cash. Said payroll deduction<br/>authorization shall be completed within 30 days. Cash payment shall be completed by the non-member within<br/>90 days of the date he/she commences teaching for the District each year.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>D. Any employee who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to<br/>joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support<br/>the Orland Teachers’ Association/CTA, NEA. Said employee shall pay, within 90 days commencing from the<br/>first day of teaching service, his or her representative fee as required in Article XI (C) as a condition of<br/>continued employment to the Orland Community Scholarship Association or another charitable organization<br/>exempt from taxation under Section 501 (c) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIZE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of certificated staff assigned to all schools shall be determined by the projected enrollment, and<br/>adjusted the first Monday after Labor Day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education teachers who consider their caseload to be excessive may request a meeting with the<br/>principal and the director of special education to determine if there are options to reduce the load. If such a<br/>meeting does not have a satisfactory result, the teacher may bring the issue to the Superintendent for<br/>resolution.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teaching staff at Mill Street and Fairview Schools shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>For grades not involved in the “class size reduction program” as implemented in 1996/97, the total number of<br/>students in those grades at that school shall be divided by 27. The resulting number, rounded mathematically,<br/>shall be the number of teachers in those grades.</p>
<p>For grades in the program, the total number of students in those grades at that school shall be divided by 20<br/>and the number of teachers employed for those grades shall be the result with any decimal rounded up to the<br/>next whole number. The classes in the program shall be monitored so that the total number of students<br/>enrolled in any class shall be 20 or less as an average for the ending day of the first seven school months.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.K. Price School</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the first Monday after Labor Day, the teacher/pupil staffing ratio will be computed as<br/>follows: The enrollment will be divided by 26. Staffing will .5 greater than the resulting number.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of applying the class size formula, a non-classroom assignment charged to categoricals<br/>will not be used to determine staffing.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orland High School</p>
<p>1. No later than the first Monday after Labor Day, the teacher/pupil staffing ratio shall be computed as<br/>follows: The enrollment will be divided by 26.7. One additional teacher will be supplied to compensate<br/>for ROP classes. Other categorical programs will not count within the class size ratio, nor will additional<br/>periods used for activities, athletics, projects, or other purposes (up to a total of five).</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may exceed the number of staff called for by this formula for support staff and/or categorical<br/>programs as it chooses. The District will consult with the Association before adding or deleting support staff.<br/>No reduction will be made in teacher preparation time without negotiation to agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and Association may agree to waive the use of the staffing formula on a temporary basis if the<br/>number of classrooms available will not allow for additional staff. The District will consult with the<br/>Association and will jointly determine the support to be provided for those whose class size exceeds the ratio.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to consult with the Association should the enrollment at a school site exceed the staffing<br/>ratio for more than a temporary period after the first Monday after Labor Day, and will provide support for<br/>those whose class size exceeds the ratio. Additional staff may be employed as a solution after discussion with<br/>the Association.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In classes where the safety of students is dependent upon the number of students in the classroom (wood, auto,<br/>welding, and other classes of similar nature involving tools and equipment), the ratio shall be one teacher for<br/>every 24 students, or shall not exceed the number of safe working stations.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School staff may agree, by consensus, to utilize personnel assigned to their schools in other than classroom<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVAILABILITY OF AGREEMENT</p>

<p>A. Health Insurance Plan:</p>
<p>1. The District agrees to provide an insurance program for 2000/2001 and succeeding years, including</p>
<p>health, life, dental, and vision insurance for all eligible unit members. The medical plan benefit level for</p>

In subsequent years, the District contribution shall be limited to 103% of<br/>the previous year’s allowable maximum contribution before any cost-sharing, plus half of any insurance<br/>premium increase in excess of 3%.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will be allowed to opt out of the District-offered health coverage under the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of other health insurance. See Group Benefit Program Plan for coverage details.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-enrollment will be available annually in the District Plan only during the window<br/>period (September).</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premium for 2000/2001 and subsequent years shall be established through a study by an independent<br/>actuarial firm selected by the Insurance Committee and approved by die District, provided the insurance<br/>continues with the existing self-funded plan; otherwise, the premium shall be subject to approval by all<br/>parties.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Insurance Committee will be composed of four certificated, four classified, and four<br/>supervisory or management employees of the District. The Associations will select their members. The<br/>Insurance Committee will meet at least once each quarter. Members of the Insurance Committee will<br/>receive financial statements as received by the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Committee will review content of the plan and make recommendations on plan changes or<br/>modifications. The Insurance Committee will recommend the insurance plan, carrier, and broker for<br/>1994/1995 and subsequent school years, subject to negotiations and ratification by all parties. If the<br/>Insurance Committee has recommended, and the OTA/CSEA negotiations team has accepted, a program<br/>with premium at or below the premium of the District-proposed program (or the existing plan premium),<br/>the District will pay the increased cost.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Committee shall be granted reasonable and sufficient release time and<br/>budget to complete its assignments.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the existing self-funded plan is dissolved during the life of this contract, all funds<br/>remaining after all costs and expenses are fully paid shall be placed into a separate fund<br/>and utilized to cover the shared portion of premium cost increases for both the District</p>
<p>and employees.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the employment of a unit member terminate during the school year, the paid District coverage shall</p>
<p>terminate at the end of the month containing the last paid day of employment.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a unit member’s employment terminate following the last day of the school year and before the<br/>commencement of the ensuing school year, such unit member shall be entitled to continued coverage under<br/>the health, dental, and vision care plans until September 1<sup>st</sup> of the ensuing school year.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member will be responsible for a prorated payment of health and welfare benefits for each month in<br/>which the unit member is on unpaid status for more than half of the work days possible in the month. The<br/>prorated share is based upon the number of work days missed compared to the total number of work days in<br/>the month. Payments will be deducted through payroll deduction.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the death of a unit member or a retired unit member who is not Medicare eligible, previously-<br/>covered family members shall continue to be covered at District expense for three calendar months after the<br/>end of the current calendar month.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is 55 or older and has been employed in the District for ten or more years of full-time<br/>service or the equivalent thereof may elect to retire and the District will pay the premium for the same medical<br/>insurance (not dental or vision) at the same level as that provided for active unit members for the unit<br/>member, spouse and qualified dependents. District-paid coverage will terminate, for the unit member, on the<br/>last day of the month in which the unit member is eligible for Medicare-age cutoff. Health benefits for the<br/>retired unit member’s spouse shall be covered by the District, at the same coverage level as the retired<br/>member, until the spouse or the unit member becomes eligible for Medicare.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Member retires at 55, spouse is 60: Spouse shall be covered approximately 5 years (or until spouse is<br/>Medicare eligible) and member shall be covered approximately 10years (or until Medicare eligible).</p>
<p>IQ</p>
<p>Member retires at 55, spouse is 50: Spouse shall be covered approximately lOyears (or until member is<br/>Medicare eligible) and member shall be covered approximately lOyears (or until Medicare eligible).</p>
<p>(This provision for spouse coverage and termination on Medicare-age cutoff eligibility shall apply<br/>beginning with the retirees activating during the 2003/2004 school year only and thereafter.)</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will pay a percentage of the premium for a unit member who retires and has worked ten or more<br/>years but less than the full-time equivalent of ten years. The percentage of ten full-time years worked shall be<br/>the percentage of the premium paid.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who retired prior to July 1, 2004, do have the option of continuing insurance coverage past<br/>Medicare age by contributing the full cost of such benefits. Effective July 1, 2004, the retired unit member<br/>and spouse will no longer have the option of buying back into the insurance plan</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Insurance</p>
<p>1. The District will provide $15,000 in life insurance for each unit member covered by the District medical<br/>plan.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Protection Insurance</p>
<p>1. Available by individual.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Sheltered Annuities</p>

<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave is considered to be an investment in the employee’s future value to the District more<br/>than a reward for past services. Therefore, two full years of service to the District shall immediately<br/>follow a sabbatical leave.</p>
