<p>The children of non-resident certificated unit members of the District may be enrolled at<br/>any time, in accordance with Board Policy 5117: Eligibility of Non-Resident Student<br/>Eligibility, Section 3. If this provision to BP 5117 is eliminated, the children of certificated<br/>unit members who are enrolled at that time may complete their K-8 education in the<br/>District, so long as the unit member parent remains an employee of the District.</p>
<p>A certificated unit member who has children too young for school at the time the BP 5117<br/>provision is eliminated may enroll those children and their future siblings in the District,<br/>so long as the parent remains an employee of the District.</p>

Revisions in projected vacancies shall be made known<br/>to unit members as they occur. Projected vacancies shall remain open for five [5) work<br/>days; closing dates will be specified. If more than one unit member requests the same<br/>vacancy, the criteria set forth in section 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 shall apply to determine which<br/>request is granted.</p>
<p>10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Change Of Assignment Requests</p>
<p>A unit member may request a voluntary change of assignment by placing the request in<br/>writing and submitting same to the Superintendent. If a unit member has requested<br/>reassignment to a position within the unit that is, or will be, vacant, the unit member will<br/>be considered for the vacancy before it is offered to a new hire. If a request for a change<br/>of assignment is ultimately denied, the unit member shall be provided with reasons for<br/>the denial.</p>
<p>10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Staff Assignments</p>
<p>By April 15 of each school year, preliminary staff assignments for the next academic year<br/>shall be communicated in writing to each unit member. Before preliminary assignments<br/>are made, the principal and/or Superintendent will meet with any unit member who may<br/>be given an assignment different from his/her current assignment. A unit member may<br/>always request a conference regarding his/her assignment.</p>
<p>10.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary Teachers Assignment</p>
<p>Temporary teachers will be notified of their status for the upcoming school year by<br/>May 15.</p>
<p>10.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Vacancies After April 15</p>
<p>If new vacancies are created after April 15, existing unit members will be given the<br/>opportunity to apply for a voluntary change in assignment on an equal basis with outside<br/>applicants as required by Education Code Section 35036. The District will make a good<br/>faith effort to hire new staff to fill whatever vacancies remain, with the exception of a<br/>vacancy in a multi-grade class. If it becomes necessary, after a good faith effort, to<br/>reassign an existing unit member to fill a vacancy, the unit member will be notified of the<br/>reassignment at the earliest possible date. Projected vacancies shall remain open until<br/>filled. Vacancies arising during the summer will be announced to all unit members<br/>through unit member District e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>-21-</p>
<p>10.9 Support For Unit Member Given Change In Assignment</p>
<p>Any unit member given a change in teaching assignment shall receive support. The unit<br/>member and administration will consult and mutually agree on the level of support<br/>needed based on unit member experience. The support could include, but is not limited<br/>to: conferences, trainings, curriculum planning times, classroom observations, meeting<br/>time with a curriculum coach or buddy, or supplies. If non-work days are used for<br/>support, the unit member will receive the extended hourly rate for such days.</p>
<p>10.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Certificated Positions</p>
<p>If the District creates a new certificated position at any time, existing unit members will<br/>be given the opportunity to apply for a voluntary change in assignment or transfer to the<br/>new position.</p>
<p>10.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplementary Instruction</p>
<p>All of the above provisions shall apply to the assignment of state-mandated<br/>supplementary instruction duties, except that such duties shall be voluntary.</p>
<p>10.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Special Assignments&quot;</p>
<p>The District, at its discretion, may determine the need for a &quot;special assignment.” Any<br/>such assignment, part-time or full-time, shall be clearly defined and posted as a vacancy<br/>to all current unit members prior to filling the position.</p>
<p>10.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment Due to Layoff</p>
<p>10.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Article, &quot;reassignment due to layoff' shall be defined as a<br/>change in assignment and/or a movement from one work site to another as a<br/>result of layoff pursuant to Education Code Section 44955, and which may be<br/>necessary to ensure the retention of certificated unit members with seniority<br/>greater than those laid off. This definition excludes any transfer or assignment<br/>change that does not result from the District’s obligation to reassign pursuant to<br/>Education Code Section 44955.</p>
<p>10.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Notice</p>
<p>Any unit member scheduled to be reassigned due to layoff shall be entitled to a<br/>written notice of the reassignment within ten [10] calendar days of the effective<br/>date of the reassignment and in addition, upon request, will be entitled to a<br/>conference with the site administrator and the Superintendent regarding the<br/>reassignment at which time the unit member will be provided with the reasons<br/>for the reassignment and with the opportunity to discuss those reasons.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 11: CLASS SIZE AND STAFFING CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>11.1 Class Size Considerations</p>
<p>11.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the provisions of Section 11.2.1 will be mutually agreed upon<br/>by the teacher and site administrator, subject to review by the Superintendent<br/>and the Association President.</p>
<p>11.1.1.1 The maximum class size shall be 24 in grades K-3; 30 in grades 4-5; and 33 in<br/>grades 6-8. These class size numbers shall apply to physical education.</p>
<p>If a class size is nearing the contractual maximum, a plan for support will be<br/>developed by the site administrator and unit member involved. Support will<br/>be provided immediately when the maximum is exceeded, subject to normal<br/>time frames for securing such resources (e.g., hiring additional personnel].</p>
<p>11.1.1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music classes in grades K-6 and physical education classes in grades 1-5 are<br/>not intended to exceed 1 class section per teacher at any one class period.<br/>Examples of short-term circumstances in which there may be 2 class sections<br/>per teacher include but are not limited to special schedules for assemblies,<br/>accommodating preparation time or grade level meetings and a short-term<br/>strategy to address increased enrollment. Each short-term circumstance<br/>shall not exceed ten [10] school days.</p>
<p>In grades 7-8, the maximum class size for music classes shall be 50.</p>
<p>11.1.1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum caseload for resource specialist teachers shall be 28.</p>
<p>11.1.1.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average caseload for language and speech specialists shall be 55.</p>
<p>11.1.1.5 For purposes of this Article, class sizes in grades K-5 shall include students<br/>who are mainstreamed from a Strategies class into a regular classroom<br/>teacher's class 50% or more of the regular student instructional day.</p>
<p>11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any teacher, the total number of pupils enrolled in her/his classes shall not<br/>exceed an average of 150 a day. For part-time teachers, the total pupil limit<br/>will be in the same proportion to 150 that their service bears to full time.</p>
<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-graded classes in grades 4-5 shall have at least two fewer pupils than the<br/>average single-grade class of the grade level having the larger number of<br/>pupils, unless such difference is caused by pupil withdrawal from the school, or<br/>unless mutually agreed upon by the Association and the administration.</p>
<p>Should participation in the California Class Size Reduction Program cease for<br/>all of the classes at a given grade level, this provision shall also apply to that<br/>grade level [K-3].</p>
<p>11.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In single-grade classes [K-5] no class shall be more than two pupils larger than<br/>any other at the same grade, unless such difference is caused by pupil<br/>withdrawal from the school except as provided by Article 13.3.</p>
<p>-23-</p>
<p>In 6-8 core classes, no class shall be more than four pupils larger than any<br/>other at the same grade, unless such difference is caused by pupil withdrawal<br/>from the school. For the purpose of this section, &quot;Core&quot; is defined as a language<br/>arts and social studies class taught by a single teacher for a time period<br/>equivalent to at least 1/3 of the normal instructional day for the grade level.</p>
<p>-24-</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12: SUBSTITUTE DUTIES</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make a good faith effort to provide substitutes for all regularly scheduled<br/>classes including in circumstances set forth in section 12.3.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers in grades 6 through 8 will substitute for teachers who are on a field trip if they<br/>have been relieved of students for one or more periods as a result of the field trip. A<br/>teacher will be obliged to substitute for up to the number of periods for which he/she has<br/>been relieved. Teachers will be informed by the administration of the need to substitute<br/>at least one week in advance, and they will be provided with lesson plans at least one day<br/>in advance.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher of a self-contained or core class who elects not to accompany his or her class on<br/>an overnight trip may be required to substitute for another teacher who agrees to go on<br/>such trip in his or her place, as long as the substitute assignment is for a self-contained or<br/>core class. A teacher may voluntarily agree to substitute for a class or classes other than a<br/>self-contained class.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher who is relieved of students is not assigned a suitable substitute position, he or<br/>she may be required to perform professionally appropriate duties by the principal. These<br/>duties will be performed during the same hours he/she normally teaches, unless the<br/>teacher agrees to a different schedule.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exceptions stated in Sections 12.2 and 12.3 above, teachers will not be required<br/>to substitute for other teachers or to have members of other teachers’ classes assigned to<br/>them for supervision, except in cases of emergency as provided in Administrative<br/>Guidelines for the Assignment of Substitutes. (See Appendix #5.) The provisions of this<br/>article in no way prevent the exchange of pupils between teachers by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13: INCLUSIVE EDUCATION</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose: The purpose of this Article is to support general education teachers in<br/>their commitment to provide inclusive education students with the same quality<br/>education programs afforded to all students.</p>
<p>13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this Article, inclusive education students are defined as:</p>
<p>13.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students with a current IEP;</p>
<p>13.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who receive the assistance of a paraeducator as written in the IEP;<br/>and</p>
<p>13.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are mainstreamed from a Strategies class or fully included into<br/>a general education classroom teacher’s class.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a student described in Section 13.1 is initially assigned to a general education<br/>classroom each school year, a planning meeting will be scheduled with the general<br/>education classroom teacher, the special education case manager, and an administrator to<br/>review the student's IEP requirements and identify and provide any additional<br/>information, training, and/or support needed by the classroom teacher to implement IEP<br/>requirements for which the teacher is responsible. This meeting shall be scheduled<br/>within 15 days of the student's assignment to the class or as soon as practical. Additional<br/>meetings may be held as requested by unit members or the District.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination of the size and makeup of classes that will include the inclusive<br/>education student(s) shall take into consideration any extraordinary demands on<br/>physical space, classroom climate, and/or teacher supervision and planning.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will ensure the regularly scheduled presence of paraeducators, including<br/>securing substitutes, in order that they perform required duties. Unit members<br/>acknowledge their professional responsibility in cases of emergency (as defined by<br/>section 3.2 or a 911 call).</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be afforded the opportunity to give input regarding the schedules for<br/>paraeducators developed by the paraeducator's supervisor.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and Association acknowledge and agree that the purpose of this Article as set<br/>forth in section 13.1 above is well served by making student assignments in accordance<br/>with legal requirements in a manner in which as many general education self-contained<br/>and core classroom teachers as practical gain relevant experience and expertise. These<br/>assignments will be allocated equitably across unit members within grade levels. (Core is<br/>defined as a language arts and/or social studies class taught by a single teacher for a time<br/>period equivalent to at least 1/3 of the normal instructional day for the grade level.)</p>
<p>13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members, in consultation with District and site administrators, shall be provided<br/>support and assistance (such as scheduling consideration, released time, training, and/or<br/>paraeducator support) to carry out responsibilities and requirements (such as training,<br/>meetings, and curriculum development) associated with inclusive education student(s).</p>
<p>-26-</p>
<p>13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in cases of emergency (as defined in section 3.2 or a 911 call), no unit member<br/>shall be required to perform specialized services such as assisting with personal care<br/>tasks or health and/or medical procedures unless he/she has volunteered to be<br/>designated as a unit member who will perform such services as permitted by law and has<br/>been trained. &quot;Volunteer&quot; means the decision to be designated as set forth in this section<br/>is entirely at the initiative and discretion of the teacher. A unit member's volunteering to<br/>do so does not set a precedent for the ongoing provision of such services by a unit<br/>member assigned to a particular grade level.</p>
<p>13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings between unit members and support specialists and/or parents should be<br/>scheduled, whenever possible, before or after class hours. This shall not preclude the<br/>scheduling of all-day, consecutive IEP meetings.</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the distinct efforts made by general education unit members to<br/>accomplish the purpose of this Article as set forth in section 13.1 above, the District will<br/>provide support as follows:</p>
<p>13.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the request of the unit member or principal, &quot;support meetings&quot; shall<br/>be held to discuss alternatives for supporting the general education teacher<br/>with regard to section 13.1 above. Examples of such alternatives may<br/>include but are not limited to paraeducators, prep time, restructuring of the<br/>student's day, clerical support, etc.</p>
<p>13.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-5 general education unit members providing inclusive education for 50%<br/>or more of the regular student instructional day as defined in this Article<br/>shall, upon written request to the site administrator and Director of<br/>Student Services, receive an annual stipend of $500.</p>
<p>13.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A K-5 general education teacher may request additional support beyond<br/>that described in section 13.10 through the process set forth in sections</p>
<p>13.11.1 through 13.11.3.</p>
<p>13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to inclusive education students as defined by this Article, the parties recognize<br/>that there are exceptional cases in which general education teachers may be required to<br/>devote additional time and resources to other students with complex needs, behavioral<br/>issues, and/or other circumstances that present challenges to establishing the most<br/>effective learning environment for the student. This may include situations in which the<br/>student's supports may not have been fully identified. In such cases, the following shall<br/>apply:</p>
<p>13.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A K-8 general education teacher, site administrator or the Director of<br/>Student Services may initiate a request that the teacher receive the<br/>supports set forth in section 13.10.</p>
<p>13.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon agreement by the involved administrator and the unit member, such<br/>request shall be granted.</p>
<p>13.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the foregoing parties are not able to reach agreement, the unit member<br/>may request review by the Superintendent. The decision of the<br/>Superintendent shall be final.</p>
<p>-27-</p>
<p>ARTICLE 14: EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator</p>
<p>Unit members covered by this Agreement shall be evaluated by an administrator who</p>
<p>shall be identified as the &quot;immediate supervisor.”</p>
<p>14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency (Education Code 544644fa))</p>
<p>Evaluation and assessment of the performance of each bargaining unit member shall be</p>
<p>made on a continuing basis as follows:</p>
<p>14.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary unit members shall be evaluated at least once each<br/>school year.</p>
<p>14.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members shall be evaluated at least every other school year,<br/>unless they qualify for and elect evaluation at least every five (5) years as detailed<br/>in Section 14.2.2.1.</p>
<p>14.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members with permanent status shall be evaluated at least<br/>every five years if the unit member and evaluator consent to this<br/>schedule if the unit member meets the following criteria:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been employed at least ten (10) years with the District</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is highly qualified (if their position requires this designation<br/>as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801 (23) (ESEA) and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose previous summative evaluation rating was &quot;meets<br/>standards.”</p>
<p>14.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon unit member and evaluator consent, the form to indicate that<br/>the five-year schedule has been chosen shall be completed at the<br/>goal setting meeting to be held no later than October 15.</p>
<p>14.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the evaluator withdraw consent, the unit member shall be<br/>notified by May 15 and provided with reasons for the denial. Should<br/>either the evaluator or the unit member withdraw consent, a<br/>standard, formal evaluation will be conducted in the following<br/>school year.</p>
<p>14.2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves of absence shall not be construed as a break in the ten (10)<br/>years of service required for this evaluation schedule.</p>
<p>14.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are not scheduled to be evaluated during the current year, but<br/>who have requested and received a change in grade level or subject matter<br/>assignment may be required to participate in the formal evaluation process,<br/>contingent upon prior experience.</p>
<p>-28-</p>
<p>14.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who receives a &quot;does not meet standards” summative evaluation<br/>rating shall be evaluated annually until a positive evaluation is achieved or the unit<br/>member resigns, is dismissed, or otherwise leaves the District.</p>
<p>14.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is scheduled to be evaluated during a particular school year, but<br/>is granted a leave of absence for one (1] semester or longer, the evaluation shall<br/>take place during the first year of the unit member's return to duty. The<br/>provisions of this Section 14.2.5 shall not apply to unit members granted a leave of<br/>absence for the purposes of a &quot;job share.” Unit members on a job share assignment<br/>will be evaluated according to the schedules described above.</p>
<p>14.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are not on a formal evaluation cycle will meet with their<br/>supervisor no later than October 15 of each year to review the prior year's goals,<br/>to establish three goals for the current year, and to plan for professional<br/>development.</p>
<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Criteria (Education Code §44661.5.44662)</p>
<p>The California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) as periodically revised (see<br/>Appendix 9), shall be used to assess a unit member's performance.</p>
<p>14.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-classroom (e.g., counselors, nurse, librarian, etc.) unit members whose<br/>responsibilities cannot be evaluated under the above standards shall be evaluated<br/>according to standards and criteria set forth in evaluation-related forms specific to<br/>their classification.</p>
<p>14.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment shall not include the use of publishers' norms<br/>established by standardized tests.</p>
<p>14.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Steps</p>
<p>No later than September 15 of the year in which the evaluation is to take place, unit members to<br/>be evaluated shall be furnished a copy of the evaluation procedures, the name of the immediate<br/>supervisor to whom he/she is assigned for evaluation purposes, a copy of the CSTP (Appendix 9)<br/>upon which the evaluation is to be based, copies of the goal-setting form, and a copy of this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>14.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Process</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall include the following activities at a minimum:</p>
<p>14.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal classroom observations shall be scheduled with the unit member at<br/>least two (2) work days prior to their occurrence and shall be followed by an<br/>observation conference within three (3) work days of the observation. A unit<br/>member, upon request, shall be entitled to additional classroom observations.<br/>Nothing in this Article shall preclude informal classroom visits by<br/>administrators.</p>
<p>14.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observation form will become part of the personnel file.</p>
<p>-29-</p>
<p>14.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a summative evaluation rating of &quot;does not meet standards&quot;, the</p>
<p>principal and the immediate supervisor shall take positive action to assist the<br/>unit member in correcting any cited deficiencies, including assignment to a<br/>Consulting Teacher under the provisions of Article 15: Peer Assistance Review<br/>Program. The role of the immediate supervisor and/or Consulting Teacher to<br/>assist the unit member shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<p>14.5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific recommendations for improvement;</p>
<p>14.5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direct assistance to implement such recommendations;</p>
<p>14.5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provision of additional resources to be utilized to assist with<br/>improvement;</p>
<p>14.5.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;techniques to assess improvement;</p>
<p>14.5.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a time schedule to monitor progress.</p>
<p>14.5.4 Because Education Code §44664 requires the evaluation to be continuous in</p>
<p>nature, the evaluation shall include data collection during the entire evaluation<br/>period, including but not limited to, data collected under the appropriate<br/>evaluation model. (See Appendix 8)</p>
<p>14.5.5 A unit member shall not be evaluated on, or held accountable for, any aspect of<br/>the educational program over which the unit member has no authority to<br/>correct or modify.</p>
<p>14.6 Evaluation Process Models</p>
<p>14.6.1 Intensive Evaluation Process</p>
<p>14.6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;intensive evaluation” process shall be provided for all unit<br/>members who are designated as probationary/temporary or for<br/>permanent unit members who have received a summative<br/>evaluation rating of &quot;does not meet standards&quot; in the prior year's<br/>evaluation. (See definition in Section 15.3.1.1] Probationary unit<br/>members who held permanent status in their previous district<br/>within the last three years may choose the &quot;standard evaluation”<br/>process.</p>
<p>The unit member shall be assigned a &quot;Consulting Teacher&quot; in<br/>accordance with the provisions of the District's PAR Program.</p>
<p>14.6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor and the unit member shall meet no later<br/>than October 15 of each year to review the prior year's goals, to<br/>establish three goals for the current year, and to plan for<br/>professional development. The supervisor may modify or add<br/>objectives at any time during the evaluation period.</p>
<p>14.6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor, the Consulting Teacher, and the unit<br/>member shall determine a specific number of formal observations to</p>
<p>-30-</p>
<p>be conducted throughout the course of the school year. However, in<br/>no case shall there be fewer than three formal observations by the<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>Prior to each formal observation, the immediate supervisor and the<br/>unit member will confer regarding the objectives and strategies to<br/>be reflected in the lesson and the elements of the CSTP to be<br/>emphasized. Following each formal observation, the immediate<br/>supervisor will meet with the unit member to discuss the<br/>observation. A written summary of the observation and the<br/>conference will be given to the unit member within five (5] working<br/>days of the formal observation.</p>
<p>14.6.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than 30 calendar days prior to the end of the school year,<br/>the immediate supervisor and the unit member shall meet to discuss<br/>and review the summative evaluation.</p>
<p>14.6.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Education Code § 44664 requires the evaluation to be<br/>continuous in nature, the summative evaluation will be based upon<br/>data collection during the entire evaluation process, as well as data<br/>collected through both formal and informal classroom observations<br/>and/or information discussed in supervisor/unit member<br/>conferences. [See Appendix 8.) In addition, the results of a unit<br/>member’s participation in the Peer Assistance and Review Program<br/>(Article 15) shall be made available to the supervisor for his/her<br/>discretionary use in the summative evaluation.</p>
<p>14.6.2 Standard Evaluation Process</p>
<p>14.6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;standard evaluation&quot; process shall be provided for all<br/>permanent unit members who received a summative evaluation<br/>rating of &quot;satisfactory&quot; in the most recent evaluation. (Probationary<br/>unit members who held permanent status in their previous district<br/>within the last three (3) years may choose the &quot;standard evaluation&quot;<br/>process.)</p>
<p>If the unit member requests, he/she may be assigned a &quot;Consulting<br/>Teacher&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the District's PAR<br/>Program, Article 15.</p>
<p>14.6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor and the unit member shall meet no later<br/>than October 15 to review the prior year's goals, to establish three</p>
<p>(3) goals for the current year, and to plan for professional<br/>development. The unit member and the supervisor shall mutually<br/>identify the goals and objectives upon which the summative<br/>evaluation will be based, except that the supervisor may add one<br/>goal.</p>
<p>14.6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor, the Consulting Teacher (if one is<br/>assigned), and the unit member shall determine a specific number of</p>
<p>-31-</p>
<p>formal observations to be conducted throughout the course of the<br/>school year. In no case, however, shall there be fewer than one (1)<br/>formal observation by the immediate supervisor. At the conclusion<br/>of each scheduled observation, the immediate supervisor shall<br/>complete an Observation Checklist form and will meet with the unit<br/>member to discuss the observation. A written summary of the<br/>observation and the conference will be given to the unit member<br/>within five (5] working days of the formal observation.</p>
<p>14.6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than 30 calendar days prior to the end of the school year,<br/>the immediate supervisor and the unit member shall meet to discuss<br/>and review the summative evaluation.</p>
<p>14.6.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Education Code § 44664 requires the evaluation to be<br/>continuous in nature, the summative evaluation will be based upon<br/>data collection during the entire evaluation process, as well as data<br/>collected through both formal and informal classroom observations<br/>and/or information discussed in supervisor/unit member<br/>conferences. (See Appendix 8.)</p>
<p>14.6.3 Alternative Evaluation Process</p>
<p>14.6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;alternative evaluation&quot; process may be provided, with the<br/>consent of the immediate supervisor, for any permanent unit<br/>member who received a summative evaluation rating of &quot;meets<br/>standards” in the most recent evaluation.</p>
<p>14.6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor and the unit member shall meet no later<br/>than October 15 to discuss and agree upon the unit member’s<br/>selection of a research project or &quot;focus&quot; which is related to<br/>classroom instruction. Unit members who participate in this process<br/>shall continue to be held accountable for meeting the CSTP, but the<br/>emphasis of the evaluation process shall be on the individual project<br/>or identified instructional focus.</p>

<p>14.6.3.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Member Generated Options</p>
<p>Unit members may develop, in consultation with the<br/>immediate supervisor, new or innovative options.</p>
<p>14.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summative Evaluation Conference</p>
<p>A final written evaluation shall be transmitted to the unit member no later than thirty<br/>(30) calendar days prior to the end of the school year.

<p>A sabbatical leave is a privilege granted to qualified certificated personnel of<br/>the District. The intent of the sabbatical is to improve the effectiveness of the<br/>teacher through travel or study or both. The purpose of a sabbatical is to<br/>provide an opportunity for a qualified individual to grow professionally by<br/>means not available to her/him when carrying out a regular teaching<br/>assignment. It is expected that the benefits gained through sabbatical leave will<br/>be of immediate value to the District and extend beyond this to increase the<br/>potential contribution of the unit member to the total profession.</p>
<p>Within the limits of District policy, sabbatical leaves may be granted to<br/>certificated unit members after seven (7) years of consecutive service in the<br/>District. Seven (7) additional years of consecutive service will be required to<br/>establish eligibility for a second sabbatical leave. One sabbatical leave may be<br/>granted for each fifty certificated unit members in the unit, or major fraction<br/>thereof. By January 15 of each year the District will announce how many, if any,<br/>sabbatical leaves will be available for the next school year to qualified<br/>applicants.</p>
<p>Application</p>
<p>Application for sabbatical leave must be made to the Superintendent by letter<br/>before February 15 in order to be effective the following year.

<p>17.5 Paid Leaves</p>
<p>17.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>
<p>A certificated unit member is entitled to ten [10) days sick leave each school<br/>year, in addition to any leave days that fall under Worker's Compensation.</p>
<p>Such leave is applicable the first day of the school year, and is accumulative<br/>indefinitely. In addition to all illness/injury leave that a unit member may<br/>accumulate within the District, he/she shall also be entitled to all unused<br/>illness/injury leave which may have been accumulated while employed in a<br/>position requiring certification in another school district, provided that the<br/>teacher is coming directly from another California district without a break in<br/>service.</p>
<p>17.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave</p>
<p>A unit member may use sick leave and/or extended sick leave for disability due<br/>to pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, and recovery therefrom. Such leave shall<br/>commence with the onset of disability as determined by a physician and shall<br/>end when the unit member can return to work. The unit member may continue<br/>work until such time as her physician deems that her well-being and/or<br/>inability to perform her duties require commencement of disability leave. Such<br/>leave shall not be granted to provide periods of convalescence beyond<br/>disability prior to or following childbirth. Such leave shall not be granted to<br/>provide for childcare.</p>
<p>17.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave Bevond the Number of Earned and Accumulated Davs</p>
<p>When absence for personal illness or injury or pregnancy disability extends<br/>beyond the number of earned and accumulated days of sick leave, the unit<br/>member will be paid a salary differential for a period of time up to and<br/>including five months after all earned and accumulated sick leave has been<br/>used. The salary deduction for such absence shall be the established rate paid<br/>to the substitute teacher. A unit member may receive no more than five<br/>months of differentiated pay within a school year.</p>
<p>-51-</p>
<p>17.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Sick Leave</p>
<p>When absence for personal illness or injury extends beyond the number of<br/>earned and accumulated days of sick leave and allowable differentiated pay,<br/>the unit member will be granted Extended Sick Leave. The salary deduction<br/>during such leave shall be the lesser of the established rate paid to the<br/>substitute teacher or 50% of the Unit Member's regular salary. Any such<br/>payments will terminate at the conclusion of the school year.</p>
<p>17.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>17.5.5.1 It is the intent of the District to provide a Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>Program where unit members who are seriously ill may use sick<br/>leave credits donated by colleagues. The intent is to make available<br/>an extended period after a unit member exhausts his/her sick leave<br/>where he or she may continue to earn full pay while recuperating.<br/>Should the unit member exhaust catastrophic leave credits before<br/>the end of the school year, he or she may participate in the extended<br/>sick leave program as described in Article 17.5.4 through the end of<br/>the school year.</p>
<p>Unit members may apply for and be eligible to receive catastrophic<br/>leave pursuant to the following:</p>
<p>17.5.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is suffering from an incapacitating<br/>illness or injury which is expected to continue for an<br/>extended period of time, as verified by the attending<br/>physician, and which prevents the unit member from<br/>performing his/her regularly assigned work.</p>
<p>Physician verification shall set forth the diagnosis,<br/>prognosis and expected length of absence.</p>
<p>17.5.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time off work must create a financial hardship for<br/>the unit member because he or she has exhausted all<br/>accrued sick leave and any other paid time.</p>
<p>17.5.5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for catastrophic leave shall run concurrently<br/>with leave described in Articlel7.5.3 (Sick Leave<br/>Beyond the Number of Earned and Accumulated Days]<br/>in the Collective Bargaining Agreement for a<br/>maximum of five months.</p>
<p>17.5.5.1.4 In the event that the participating unit member is</p>
<p>unable to return to work after exhausting catastrophic<br/>leave described in Section 17.5.5.1.3 above, he or she<br/>shall be eligible for Extended Sick Leave as described<br/>in Article 17.5.4 of the Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement for the remainder of the school year.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 18: REDUCED WORKLOAD PROGRAM</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request to reduce his/her workload from full-time to part-time and<br/>receive full-time retirement credit under Section 44922 of the California Education Code.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements for eligibility are as follows:</p>
<p>18.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have reached the age of 55 prior to reduction in<br/>workload.</p>
<p>18.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have been employed full-time in a position requiring<br/>certification for at least ten years of which the immediately preceding five<br/>years were full-time employment.</p>
<p>18.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period immediately preceding a request for a reduction in<br/>workload, the unit member shall have been employed full time in a position<br/>requiring certification for a total of at least five years without a break in<br/>service. For purposes of this subdivision, sabbaticals and other approved<br/>leaves of absence shall not constitute a break in service. Time spent on a<br/>sabbatical or other approved leave of absence shall not be used in computing<br/>the five-year full-time service requirement prescribed by this subdivision.</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the program must be approved by the Superintendent. The<br/>Superintendent will consider whether the unit member meets the eligibility requirements<br/>as set forth above.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a unit member enters the program, participation is limited to a ten-year period<br/>during which time the District may not revoke the agreement without the consent of the<br/>unit member. By February 15 of each year, the unit member must notify the District of<br/>his/her intent to return to full-time status or to retire. After ten years of participation,<br/>the unit member must retire. No unit member shall participate after attaining the age of<br/>65. Any unit member in the program who reaches 65 during the school year may<br/>continue in the program for the balance of that year only.</p>
<p>18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum reduced workload employment must be the equivalent of at least half the<br/>number of days of service required by the member’s contract of employment during the<br/>last year served in a full-time, certificated position.</p>
<p>18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be paid a salary which is the pro rata share of the salary he or she<br/>would be earning had he or she not elected to exercise the option of part-time<br/>employment but shall retain all other rights and benefits for which he/she would be<br/>eligible if he/she remained on full-time employment. The District contribution to health<br/>and welfare benefits shall be the same as for a full time unit member.</p>
<p>18.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member and employer agree to submit contributions to the State Teachers<br/>Retirement System based on the compensation that would be earned for full-time<br/>employment.</p>
<p>18.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than those listed above, there must be no additional costs to the District in<br/>providing this program.</p>
<p>-59-</p>
<p>18.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments are determined on an annual basis. The part-time duties to be rendered by<br/>the unit member, as well as dates and times of service, shall be established by the District<br/>in consultation with the unit member. Approval to participate in the Reduced Workload<br/>Program does not ensure a certain assignment.</p>
<p>18.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By July 1, prior to the start of each school year, the unit member shall sign a contract of<br/>agreement setting forth these conditions and such other details as may be necessary to<br/>insure a mutually satisfactory understanding on the part of the unit member and the<br/>District of the Reduced Workload Program services to be rendered and the times at which<br/>they are to be performed.</p>

<p>The arbitrator shall limit his decision strictly to the interpretation<br/>and application of the specific provisions of this Agreement that may<br/>be at issue, and shall be without power or authority to make any<br/>decision that is:</p>
<p>20.6.3.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contrary to, or inconsistent with, or modifying,<br/>altering, amending, or varying in any way of the terms,<br/>conditions, or provisions of this Agreement or of<br/>applicable law or rules or regulations having the force<br/>and effect of law; or</p>
<p>20.6.3.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involves Governing Board discretion or Board Policy<br/>not covered by the terms of this Agreement, or Board<br/>action under all applicable statutes or rules or<br/>regulations of the State Board of Education, or matters<br/>as to which the Board is without authority to act; or</p>
<p>20.6.3.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limits or interferes in any way with the powers, duties,<br/>and responsibilities of the Governing Board under<br/>policies not covered by the Agreement, applicable<br/>statutes, and/or rules and regulations having the force<br/>and effect of law.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall be empowered to include in any award such<br/>financial reimbursement or other remedies judged to be proper.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall render a decision in writing to both parties<br/>setting forth the findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the<br/>issues submitted. Such decision shall be rendered as promptly as<br/>possible and shall be final and binding on both parties to the<br/>dispute.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 21: LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each<br/>had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to all<br/>proper subjects of collective bargaining, and that all such subjects have been discussed and<br/>negotiated upon, and the agreements contained in this Contract were arrived at after the free<br/>exercise of all such rights and opportunities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Governing Board and the Association, for the life of this Agreement, each agrees<br/>that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter<br/>not specifically covered in this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have<br/>been within the knowledge of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed<br/>this Agreement. This does not preclude negotiations on the contents of an Agreement to become<br/>effective after the expiration of this Agreement.</p>
<p>-66-</p>
<p>ARTICLE 22: PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES</p>
<p>22.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties recognize the desirability of continuous and uninterrupted operation of the<br/>instructional program during the normal school year and the avoidance of disputes that<br/>threaten to interfere with such operations. Since the parties are establishing<br/>comprehensive grievance procedures under which unresolved disputes may be settled,<br/>the parties have removed the basic cause of work interruptions during the period of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>22.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association accordingly agrees that during the period of this Agreement, no work<br/>interruptions of any kind shall be called or sanctioned by the Association.</p>

<p>APPENDIX #3</p>
<p>LAS LOMITAS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>Professional Day and Professional Year</p>
<p>BACKGROUND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1970’s the District’s administration and LLEA (Las</p>
<p>Lomitas Education Association) representatives, developed<br/>definitions for the “professional day” and the “professional year.”</p>
<p>This was done prior to the passage of collective bargaining laws, and<br/>the definitions have become part of accepted practice, rather than<br/>Board Policy or Contract Language.</p>
<p>It was agreed it would be advantageous, both to the administration<br/>and to the staff, to observe these definitions as ongoing practice,<br/>rather than to reduce the definitions to writing and include them in<br/>the first collective bargaining agreement (adopted in 1976).<br/>Throughout the period of our collective bargaining agreements, these<br/>definitions have been observed as past practice.</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL DAY During the “professional day” (defined as 8:00 am - 4:00 pm),</p>
<p>teachers are to be accessible to students, parents, and other staff.</p>
<p>The administration has the prerogative to require staff to observe<br/>these professional hours. This definition of the “professional day”<br/>has been modified through practice to adjust the requirements (1) for<br/>Wednesdays (8:00 am - 4:30 pm) and Fridays (8:00 am - 3:30 pm)<br/>and (2) for middle school teachers to move all times 15 minutes<br/>earlier to accommodate the 8-period day schedule. It has also been<br/>understood that staff will be given 24 hour notice when<br/>appointments and/or meetings are to be scheduled which require<br/>attendance at the opening or close of a “professional day.”</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL YEAR The “professional year” includes all instructional and professional</p>
<p>days in the Board adopted annual School District Calendar (183<br/>days in 1999-00 and 185 in 2000-01 and thereafter). The basis for<br/>extra remuneration for extra duties has been defined as “extended<br/>year service,” i.e., beyond the “professional year.” (Work done on<br/>weekends, on holidays and during vacation periods would qualify.)<br/>Adjunct duties beyond the professional day, e.g., attendance at<br/>evening events or committee meetings, have never been defined<br/>other than by past practice expectations at each school site.</p>
<p>-80-</p>
<p>APPENDIX #4</p>
<p>Administrative Guidelines for the Approval of Coursework</p>
<p>After initial employment, a maximum of 60 post-graduate semester units beyond the base salary<br/>requirement of 30 post-graduate semester units (for a maximum grand total of 90 post-graduate<br/>semester units) may be earned for additional salary credit. In order to qualify for salary credit,<br/>the units must:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be approved prior to enrollment by the immediate supervisor (usually the building<br/>principal) and the Superintendent;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be directly related to the unit member's current professional growth plan;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be awarded by an accredited college or university OR be approved/offered by the District;<br/>and</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be taken at the unit member's own expense. Coursework taken on District time, or paid for<br/>by the District, may not be used for salary credit.</p>
<p>Salary credit for additional post-graduate units will be awarded once a year, at the beginning of<br/>the school year. In order to receive credit in any given year, an original transcript (or signed<br/>verification of the completion of district offered training) must be received by the<br/>Superintendent no later than November 1.</p>
<p>Credit for College/University Units:</p>
<p>The following process must be used to receive approval of college/university units for salary<br/>credit:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the form.</p>
<p>Request Approval of Graduate Courses. This form must be completed in duplicate for each<br/>class. Attach a description of the proposed coursework, and identify the element(s) of your<br/>Plan for Professional Development that the course addresses.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get required signatures.</p>
<p>Signed approval from both the principal and the Superintendent must be obtained prior to<br/>beginning the coursework.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the course(s), request that an official transcript be sent to:</p>
<p>Las Lomitas Elementary School District<br/>1011 Altschul Avenue<br/>Menlo Park, CA 94025<br/>Attention: Human Resources Specialist</p>
<p>No credit will be granted without verification by an official transcript from an accredited<br/>college or university.</p>
<p>Transcripts for coursework completed over the summer must be received by November 1<sup>st<br/></sup>of any given year in order to receive salary credit for the current school year. (For example,</p>
<p>-81-</p>
<p>transcripts for coursework completed in the summer of 1999 must be received no later than<br/>November 1,1999 in order to receive salary credit in the 1999-00 school year.)</p>
<p>Verifications received after November 1 will not result in salary credit until the following<br/>school year. Salary credit for classes taken September - June of any given school year will not<br/>be given until the following school year.</p>
<p>4. Beginning in 2001-02, unit members who did not receive full credit for post-graduate units<br/>at time of hire may include those units in the calculation of their salaries. Official transcripts<br/>for the additional claimed units must be received by the Superintendent no later than<br/>November 1, 2001. The District will pay the increased cost to a maximum of ten (10)<br/>additional units per year over a period of three years.</p>
<p>-82-</p>
<p>APPENDIX #5</p>
<p>Administrative Guidelines for the Assignment of Substitutes</p>
<p>Substitute Procedures:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall contact the online substitute program as soon as an anticipated<br/>absence is known.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The online substitute program will attempt to secure a substitute, taking into consideration<br/>the need to match grade level and subject.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher shall leave adequate substitute plans. Each teacher will keep an “emergency<br/>lesson plan&quot; on file in the office to be used in unforeseen instances. School office personnel<br/>will be responsible for giving the substitute a map of the school, directions about general<br/>procedures, bell schedules, keys, etc. If the teacher has planned for the absence in advance,<br/>the office staff will also deliver the lesson plans. Lesson plans may be left with the school<br/>secretary or faxed/e-mailed to the school prior to the first period of absence.</p>
<p>Unavailability of substitutes:</p>
<p>When a substitute is not available, the following steps will be taken:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the teacher requesting the substitute is assigned to other temporary duties within the<br/>District, he/she will return to the classroom. If possible, the teacher will be notified the day<br/>before the absence if a substitute is unavailable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the teacher is attending a nearby conferences or workshop, he/she may be required to<br/>return to the site to teach his/her class(es). If possible, the teacher will be notified the day<br/>before the absence if a substitute is unavailable.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrator or other certificated personnel, if available, may choose to cover the class<br/>for a portion of the day.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers or an administrator at a school site may decide to divide the students from the<br/>absent teacher's class among two or more classrooms for all or for a portion of the day. A<br/>teacher assigned additional students shall be paid a proportional amount [based on the<br/>number of students and number of hours/periods) of the daily substitute pay rate for the<br/>time he/she had the extra students in class. In order to receive such pay, teachers who have<br/>provided substitute services must complete a district time sheet and submit it within five [5]<br/>working days.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher (by mutual agreement with the principal) may cover a class during his/her<br/>preparation period. The teacher will be paid at the extended hourly rate.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an appropriate substitute for a special program teacher in grades Pre-K-8 is<br/>unavailable, the class(es) will be covered under the general direction of the principal.</p>
<p>-83-</p>
<p>Substitute coverage for special programs:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No substitutes will be secured for counselors unless there is an extended absence of more<br/>than two weeks.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the school year, teachers of special pull-out programs (such as reading,<br/>math lab, K-5 resource specialist, ELD, or speech) shall establish whether or not the<br/>student(s) would benefit more from remaining in the regular classroom or from working<br/>with a substitute. If the latter, the special program teacher shall follow the steps delineated<br/>above.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special program teacher will be notified as soon as possible if the District is unable to<br/>provide a substitute for an instructional aide. If the absence of an instructional resource aide<br/>results in the loss of a preparation period for the regular classroom teacher, &quot;compensation<br/>prep time&quot; will be rescheduled as soon as possible at a time determined by mutual<br/>agreement between the teacher and instructional resource aide.</p>
