<p>Mileage reimbursement between the employee’s first site and<br/>subsequent assignment will be allowed according to Article XX, Section</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Teachers who are working in the above assignments will meet with the<br/>Human Resource Department by September 15<sup>th</sup> of each year to review<br/>assignment and compensation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For special program reasons, a bargaining unit member may be given an<br/>assignment in excess of 1.0 full time equivalent if it is mutually agreeable with<br/>the bargaining unit member, District, and Association. The bargaining unit<br/>member will be paid the assigned full time equivalent in excess of 1.0. It is<br/>understood that assignments in excess of 1.0 full time equivalent shall be</p>
<p>17</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to their regular assignment, kindergarten bargaining unit<br/>members shall assist other kindergarten or primary bargaining unit members,<br/>as directed by the principal, for a maximum of sixty (60) minutes per day.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary school, middle school and alternative education employees shall be<br/>present at the school site for at least fifteen (15) minutes prior to the<br/>beginning of the instructional day and remain for fifteen (15) minutes<br/>following the end of the instructional day. Comprehensive high school<br/>bargaining unit members may adjust the fifteen (15) minute before and after<br/>school requirement to fulfill the contracted seven hour work day and<br/>accommodate the “A” period and mandatory six (6) period day for all students.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall be available on a reasonable basis to meet with parents or<br/>guardians to discuss their student’s needs.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every employee shall have a duty-free lunchtime per day of at least thirty (30)<br/>consecutive minutes.</p>
<p>B. Meetings</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator/designee may call mandatory staff, collaboration,<br/>department and, student team meetings (SST, 504, IEP) as needed.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff meetings shall not exceed one (1) hour per week unless reasonable notice<br/>is given to the employees that the meeting will last longer. Attendance beyond<br/>one (1) hour will be on a voluntary basis. Bargaining unit members who want<br/>to leave after one (1) hour shall give the principal prior notice of that intent.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of all mandatory meetings outside the bargaining unit member’s 7-<br/>hour workday shall not exceed six (6) hours per month.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time spent in meetings as described in B.l that are mandatory and extend<br/>beyond the 7-hour workday will be credited toward the maximum 6 hours of<br/>mandatory meetings per month.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the total of all mandatory meetings outside the seven (7) hour workday,<br/>as described in B.l and B.2 exceeds six (6) hours per month, the bargaining<br/>unit member may be compensated at the established hourly service rate for<br/>the time beyond the six (6) hours of mandatory meetings.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On days when class schedules exceed the 7~hour workday, bargaining unit<br/>members who are required to attend a mandatory meeting as defined in B.l<br/>will receive credit toward the 6 hours of mandatory meetings for the</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>amount of time beyond the 7-hour workday and the start/end of the<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members will have input into meeting agendas and the<br/>adjusted school schedules for collaboration time.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time employees, other than job share employees, who are not able to<br/>attend a meeting set forth in B.l due to personal hardship may be excused<br/>from attendance if prior approval is granted by the principal. The principal’s<br/>approval shall not be withheld unreasonably. Any part-time employee who is<br/>excused from a meeting set forth in B.l. is responsible for the content of and<br/>any directives issued at that meeting.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two employees job share, at least one of the two must attend the meetings<br/>set forth in B.l. Both are responsible for the content of and any directives<br/>issued at those meetings.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members working less than 1.0 FTE are required to attend<br/>staff development days at the same percent of their contracted hours; i.e., if<br/>the bargaining unit member is .50 FTE, the bargaining unit member is to<br/>attend .50 of staff development days. The bargaining unit member and the<br/>site administrator must mutually agree on the staff development plan that<br/>meets the attendance requirement of the bargaining unit member’s contracted<br/>FTE.</p>
<p>If agreed to by both parties, the bargaining unit member who works less than</p>
<p>1.0 FTE may attend staff development days beyond the required hours of their<br/>full time equivalent. Attendance at staff development days beyond the<br/>bargaining unit member’s FTE will be mutually agreed upon between the<br/>bargaining unit member and their site administrator prior to the first staff<br/>development day. If mutually agreed to, the additional time over the<br/>bargaining unit member’s contracted FTE will be paid at the negotiated hourly<br/>rate of pay.</p>
<p>C. Adjunct Duties</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the length of the workday as described in A. above, the principal<br/>may assign employees to student supervision on an equitable and reasonable<br/>basis. The principal shall solicit input from and work jointly with the<br/>employees to determine which student activities require supervision and how<br/>those supervisions will be assigned. Every attempt will be made to finalize the<br/>list of student activities that require supervision in a school year by the end of<br/>the prior school year. This assignment to student supervision shall be written<br/>and posted at the school site and a copy of the posting shall be given to each<br/>bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall participate in “Back to School Night,” and “Open House. No<br/>staff meetings shall be held on these days. Bargaining unit members shall be</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>able to leave the school site at the end of the instructional day.</p>
<p>3. Curriculum work shall be on a voluntary basis unless scheduled during the<br/>normal workday or as part of scheduled staff or department meetings in B. 1.</p>
<p>D. Preparation Time</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members shall be provided with preparation time. Preparation</p>
<p>time shall be used for planning, preparation, and conferences with pupils,<br/>parents, other teachers or administrators and activities that do not require<br/>teacher student supervision. An employee may also be used as a substitute for<br/>another employee in cases of emergency. The assignment to substitute for<br/>another employee shall be on a reasonable and equitable basis. Payment for<br/>such substituting shall be made pursuant to the most recent side letter of<br/>agreement between the Association and the District on this issue.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation time shall be provided as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary classroom bargaining unit members in self-contained regular<br/>and special education classrooms and prep teachers shall be provided the<br/>equivalent of three (3) 45-minute preparation periods per five-day week,<br/>for a total equivalent of 135 minutes per a five day week. In the event<br/>that the instructional day and/or instructional week are shortened, efforts<br/>shall be made to equalize the impact of such shortening throughout all<br/>teacher preparation periods.</p>
<p>The principal shall solicit input and work jointly with elementary<br/>bargaining unit members prior to determining the program to be taught<br/>during bargaining unit members’ preparation time. The determination<br/>shall remain in effect for three school years unless staffing needs require<br/>a change for the school year subject to the availability of qualified staff.<br/>In the event that qualified staff is not available, the above consultation<br/>process shall be initiated.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school, intermediate school, and high school classroom bargaining<br/>unit members shall have one instructional period per day scheduled as<br/>preparation time.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-classroom bargaining unit members’ preparation time does not need<br/>to be taken in the same increments as a classroom teacher.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall solicit input and work jointly with elementary<br/>bargaining unit members prior to determining the program to be taught<br/>during bargaining unit members’ preparation time. The determination<br/>shall remain in effect for three school years unless staffing needs require<br/>a change for the school year subject to the availability of qualified staff.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>In the event that qualified staff is not available, the above consultation<br/>process shall be initiated.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some circumstances where the scheduled preparation time may<br/>of necessity be eliminated or modified. This shall be limited to: 1)<br/>emergencies such a fire or similar crisis necessitating evacuation of the<br/>building, the closing of school, or modification of the schedule; 2) a daily<br/>schedule adjustment that provides a partial schedule on one day and the<br/>remaining schedule on another day such as has been the practice at<br/>middle and high schools on final schedules, conference days, and<br/>minimum days.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to economically provide for large group instruction as a form of<br/>elementary preparation relief, one certificated bargaining unit member<br/>and one or more paraprofessionals may be assigned responsibility for the<br/>instruction of a group of students. In any case, the adult-to-student ratio<br/>shall not exceed 1:34 and the elementary certificated bargaining unit<br/>member in large group situations shall have no more than 102 students<br/>to be responsible for during any one period of time. This practice shall<br/>not be expanded for any other purpose and constitutes the only exception<br/>to the bar against diversion of bargaining unit work.</p>
<p>3. In the event that an attempt has been made to get a substitute teacher<br/>through the automated substitute calling system, and no substitute is available, teachers<br/>may substitute on their preparation period for an absent teacher. Principals will first ask<br/>volunteers to serve as the substitute.</p>
<p>The principal or designee will identify volunteers who wish to substitute<br/>during their preparation period. A list of these volunteers will be kept by the<br/>principal or designee. When an emergency arises requiring a teacher to<br/>substitute during his/her preparation period, the principal/designee will ask<br/>for volunteers from the list on an equitable rotational basis.</p>
<p>Names, dates and hours of substitute time will be maintained in the school<br/>office by the principal/designee and submitted to Human Resources by the<br/>15<sup>th</sup> of each month on a form provided by Human Resources. Payment will be<br/>made on the 10<sup>th</sup> of the month following the receipt of the list of teachers in<br/>Human Resources. Compensatory time off may not be substituted for pay.</p>
<p>Teachers substituting on their preparation period will be paid the established<br/>hourly rate. At California High School, a double-period block will be<br/>considered as two hours.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII</p>
<p>SCHOOL YEAR CALENDAR</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school year calendar shall have 180 teaching days, 186 working days for<br/>returning bargaining unit members and 187 working days for new bargaining unit</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and SRVEA will meet by November 1, of each year to review the current<br/>year’s calendar and to negotiate the calendar for the following year.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENT. REASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bargaining unit members will be notified, in writing, of their tentative<br/>teaching assignment (grade, level, course titles) no later than ten (10)<br/>working days prior to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will be notified of any subsequent changes in their tentative<br/>assignments as soon as possible.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment is a movement of personnel to a different position within the<br/>same school or facility, i.e., different grade, level or course title from the<br/>previous term or tentative assignment, within the same school or facility.<br/>Reassignment also includes movement of personnel to different schools within<br/>the same multi-school program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A principal may reassign an employee to a different position within the same<br/>school or facility. Special Programs administrators responsible for multi¬<br/>school programs may reassign employees depending on program needs.<br/>These employees should be notified of reassignment as early as possible.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a vacancy occurs in any of the following positions - psychologist, counselor,<br/>media specialist, health educator, or bargaining unit member on special<br/>assignment - it must be posted as a vacancy and not filled by reassigning<br/>another employee from a different position at the same site. This does not<br/>prevent the reassignment of employees within multi-school programs.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request a reassignment to a different position within the<br/>same school. It is the principal’s discretion to grant or deny this request.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee does not agree with a reassignment and requests a<br/>conference, a conference shall be held with the site/program administrator<br/>and employee to discuss reasons for and alternatives to the reassignment.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, following the conference, the employee still does not agree with the<br/>reassignment, the employee shall notify the site/program administrator in<br/>writing within five (5) working days after the conference.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, following this notification, the employee is still to be considered for<br/>reassignment, the administrator shall so notify the affected employee and the<br/>Association in writing of the specific reasons s/he is being reassigned.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following such notification and upon written request by the employee, the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources (or designee) shall confer with<br/>both parties, and a conferee if either desires, concerning the proposed<br/>reassignment. The Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources (or<br/>designee) shall render a decision within twenty (20) working days after the<br/>conference. This decision shall be in writing and shall include the specific<br/>reasons for the reassignment.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within seven (7) working days of receipt of the decision by the Assistant<br/>Superintendent, Human Resources (or designee), the employee may appeal<br/>the administrative decision to the Superintendent. The appeal shall be in<br/>writing and shall set forth the reasons for appeal.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) working days of receipt of the appeal, the Superintendent<br/>shall review the summaries and the decision of the Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Human Resources (or designee), and shall notify the employee, in writing, of<br/>the final decision.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure shall apply to all substantive decisions relating to<br/>reassignments. An employee who is the subject of a reassignment may use<br/>the grievance procedure to challenge only alleged procedural violations of this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>C. Transfer</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer is a movement of personnel from one school or site to another school<br/>or site except in multi-school programs as described in Reassignment (B.2.).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-Initiated Transfer: A District-initiated transfer is any transfer which<br/>is not voluntary. No District-initiated transfer shall be made unless the<br/>employee's qualifications and experience are appropriate to the position.</p>
<p>a. District-Initiated Transfer Due To Enrollment/Program Changes</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District determines that a transfer(s) is necessary because<br/>of enrollment/program changes at a school, the employee(s) at<br/>that school and the association shall be notified of the number of<br/>employees to be transferred.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such notices are given, the site administrator shall request</p>
<p>volunteer(s) for the transfer(s). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteer must be</p>
<p>appropriately credentialed to relieve the overstaffing in the<br/>affected program. Such volunteers shall be considered District-<br/>initiated transfers for purposes of placement.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after requesting a volunteer, the District determines that it is<br/>necessary to transfer an employee involuntarily, the employee</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>at the affected site with the least seniority (years of certificated<br/>service in the District as determined by service that meets the<br/>requirement for salary schedule advancement as defined in<br/>Article XX, Salaries) shall be transferred unless there is a<br/>compelling educational reason for bypassing the least senior<br/>employee. Seniority order between employees with equivalent<br/>seniority shall be determined by lottery.</p>
<p>4) If, prior to the start of the school year, a position opens at the<br/>school from which the involuntary transfer took place, the<br/>involuntarily transferred employee must be given the option to<br/>return prior to posting the position provided that the<br/>involuntarily transferred employee is properly credentialed.<br/>This opening must be in the curricular area/department of prior<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-Initiated Transfer For Reasons Other Than</p>
<p>Enrollment/Program Changes</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District-initiated transfer for reasons other than<br/>enrollment/program changes may be made for compelling<br/>educational reasons. The determination of the placement of<br/>the employee who is the subject of a District-initiated transfer<br/>for reasons other than over-staffing shall be made by the<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources (or designee)<br/>after consultation with the appropriate site administrator, the<br/>employee, and the employee's representative if requested by the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification of a District-initiated transfer for reasons other<br/>than program/enrollment changes to be effective for the<br/>beginning of the school year must be received by the affected<br/>employee on or before the last day of school unless the affected<br/>employee and the District agree to a later notification date.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Procedure For Implementing a District-Initiated Transfer Shall Be</p>
<p>As Follows:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee and the Association shall be notified in writing of<br/>the intent to transfer.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator initiating the transfer shall arrange a<br/>conference with the employee and discuss the reasons for<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is still to be considered for transfer after this<br/>conference, the administrator shall notify the affected employee<br/>in writing of the specific reasons s/he is being transferred.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, following the notification, the employee is still to be<br/>considered for transfer, the administrator shall so notify the<br/>affected employee and the Association in writing of the specific<br/>reasons s/he is being transferred.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written request by the employee, the Assistant<br/>Superintendent, Human Resources (or designee), shall confer<br/>with both parties, and a conferee if either desires, concerning<br/>the proposed District-initiated transfer. The Assistant<br/>Superintendent, Human Resources (or designee), shall render a<br/>decision within twenty (20) working days after the conference.<br/>This decision shall be in writing and shall include the specific<br/>reasons for the transfer.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within seven (7) working days of receipt of the decision by the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources (or designee), the<br/>employee may appeal the administrative decision to the<br/>Superintendent. The appeal shall be in writing and shall set<br/>forth the reasons for appeal.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) working days of receipt of the appeal, the<br/>Superintendent shall review the summaries and the decision of<br/>the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources (or designee),<br/>and shall notify the employee, in writing, of the decision, which<br/>shall be final.</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure shall apply to all substantive decisions relating<br/>to District-initiated transfer. An employee who is the subject of<br/>a District-initiated transfer may use the grievance procedure to<br/>challenge only alleged procedural violations of this Article.</p>
<p>d. Permanent employees who are the subject of a District-initiated<br/>transfer shall not be evaluated during the first year of their new<br/>assignment unless their most recent summary evaluation was<br/>designated unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>3. Employee-Initiated Transfer</p>
<p>a. An employee-initiated transfer is any transfer initiated at the request<br/>of the employee to be placed on the transfer list; employees teaching in<br/>positions requiring CLAD authorization must possess or be in the<br/>process of possessing CLAD authorization.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer lists will be developed to identify employees who wish to be<br/>contacted by Human Resources or site/program administrators in the<br/>event of a posted vacancy. Bargaining unit members on the transfer<br/>list are encouraged to provide supplemental information for the specific<br/>vacancies for which they are applying.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer List: A permanent or probationary employee, or a<br/>temporary employee who has completed a minimum of one full<br/>year of service, may apply to be placed on the Transfer List by<br/>submitting a Transfer List Request Form and a Transfer<br/>Application Form to the Certificated Human Resources Office<br/>between March 1 and March 31. Employees will thus be placed<br/>on the Transfer List, and will be notified by the Human<br/>Resources or site/program administrators regarding vacancies<br/>appropriate to their stated preference.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After submitting the forms to be on a Transfer List, the employee</p>
<p>may arrange for a meeting with the Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Human Resources (or designee), for the purpose of discussing<br/>the type of position desired and the possibilities for transfer.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the school year begins, between the first day of school and<br/>September 30, employees on the Transfer List will be sent<br/>written notice giving them the opportunity to remain on the<br/>Transfer list through March 31 of that school year, or to be<br/>removed from the list. Employees will be given a deadline date<br/>to respond, approximately two weeks after the date of the notice.<br/>After the designated deadline, only those employees<br/>designating that they wish to remain on the list will be<br/>automatically contacted for appropriate vacancies through<br/>March 31 of that school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee not on a Transfer List may apply for any posted vacancy<br/>and will be considered if the request is received during the posting<br/>period, or prior to the start of the interview process if between July 1<br/>and the first day of the following school year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after the school year has started, the District determines that a<br/>transfer will have an adverse effect on the program, the effective date<br/>of the transfer may be delayed, but in no event will it be later than the<br/>beginning of the following school year. A temporary employee must be<br/>assigned to the open position in the interim. If the employee does not<br/>agree with the delay of the effective date, s/he shall be entitled to the<br/>appeal provisions of the District-initiated transfer provision in this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>e. If an arbitrator rules that an employee other than the employee who<br/>was selected by the District should have been selected for a particular<br/>vacancy, then that employee shall not be placed in the vacancy at issue<br/>any sooner than the beginning of the school year which follows the date<br/>of the arbitrator's decision. However, the parties may mutually agree<br/>to an earlier date for placing that employee.</p>
<p>D. Posting Vacancies</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Article, a vacancy is defined as a position that is one of<br/>the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opening created by an addition to the number of current positions<br/>in the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opening created by the resignation or retirement of an employee.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opening created by an employee going on leave of absence for a<br/>minimum of one semester.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary positions shall be considered vacancies for the sole purpose<br/>of placing District-initiated transfers. However, as of the last<br/>bargaining unit member work day of the school year, any position for<br/>which a temporary employee has received a contract shall not be<br/>considered a vacancy for the following school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a vacancy occurs in any of the following positions - psychologist, counselor,<br/>media specialist, health educator, or bargaining unit member on special<br/>assignment - it must be posted as a vacancy and not filled by reassigning<br/>another employee from a different position at the same site. This does not<br/>prevent the reassignment of employees within multi-school programs.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completed posting for each vacant position shall include a detailed<br/>description of the job duties and qualifications which the District determines<br/>are essential for the vacant position and for which the applicant must have<br/>the proper credentials and appropriate experience. The posting may also<br/>include a list of program/site specific expectations.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The posting form for each vacant position shall be prominently posted at the<br/>Education Center, on the District website and at each school site for at least<br/>ten (10) days following the date of announcement. The position shall be filled<br/>only after the tenth (10th) day. Electronic copies of these lists shall be sent to<br/>the President of the Association.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After July 1 and continuing until the first work day of the school year, vacant<br/>positions must continue to be posted; however, the District may immediately<br/>fill any vacant positions from the current list of transfer requests, internal</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>applicants or from outside applicants in the event no one requesting transfer<br/>is suited by qualification and experience for the vacancy. If a vacancy occurs<br/>ten (10) working days or less before the beginning of the second semester or<br/>during the first ten (10) days of the teaching year, the vacancy shall be posted<br/>for five (5) working days.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for Posted Vacancies</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for posted vacancies shall be made by completing the Transfer<br/>Request Form and returning it to the Human Resources Office within the<br/>posted time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members on the transfer list are encouraged to provide<br/>supplemental information for the specific vacancies for which they are<br/>applying. Examples may include: a cover letter, resume and letters of<br/>recommendation.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling Vacancies</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before filling vacancies, the following shall occur:</p>

<p>Every effort shall be made to schedule Committee on Assignments meetings during<br/>the regular work hours of the bargaining unit members. In the event that<br/>committee meetings are scheduled outside of such regular work hours, bargaining<br/>unit members shall be paid at the extra duty pay rate for bargaining unit members,<br/>or, if they should so elect, they shall be granted compensatory time off to be taken in<br/>half day increments at the bargaining unit member's discretion.</p>

Congress shall be entitled<br/>to return to the position held or a comparable position to the one held by<br/>him/her at the time of his/her election at the salary to which s/he would have<br/>been entitled had s/he not absented himself/herself from the service of the<br/>District under this Section.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the bank is voluntary. At the beginning of<br/>each school year there will be an open enrollment period<br/>coinciding with the health benefits open enrollment period.</p>
<p>Unit members must have twenty (20) days of accumulated<br/>sick leave as of the first duty day of that school year to be<br/>eligible for the bank. Eligible unit members must notify the<br/>Human Resources Office, in writing, during the designated<br/>open enrollment period, of their desire to participate in the<br/>bank. The maximum anyone can contribute to the bank at<br/>any one time is one (1) sick leave day.</p>

<p>46</p>
<p>from year to year.

<p>c. Members who have accessed benefit from the bank may re¬<br/>enroll in the bank when they have twelve (12) days of<br/>accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants for benefits from the leave bank must make application<br/>through the catastrophic leave bank committee. Only individuals<br/>who have contributed to the bank will be eligible for benefits.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank Benefit: After all sick leave has been exhausted,<br/>and after fifty (50) days of extended sick leave (substitute deduct) have been<br/>utilized, up to twenty (20) days of fully paid sick leave, at the member's<br/>regular daily rate of pay, may be withdrawn from the bank. The member is<br/>then eligible for the remaining fifty (50) days of extended sick leave. These<br/>sick leave and/or extended sick leave days need not be used consecutively.<br/>A maximum of 200 sick days district-wide may be withdrawn annually from<br/>the bank. Sick leave from the bank may not be granted for periods of<br/>disability when benefits are being paid to the unit member under Worker’s<br/>Compensation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those employees enrolled in the bank will automatically continue their<br/>participation from year to year unless they notify the Human Resources<br/>Office, in writing, of their intent to withdraw from the bank. Such<br/>withdrawal from the bank must occur during the open enrollment period,<br/>and will not result in reinstatement of the time contributed to the bank.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A catastrophic leave bank committee will be established to review and<br/>either approve or deny requests. The committee will consist of two (2)<br/>administrators, and two (2) bargaining unit members selected by the<br/>Association, Approval of sick leave requests will require agreement among<br/>at least three (3) of the four (4) members. Approval or denial of catastrophic<br/>leave requests by the catastrophic leave bank committee shall be final<br/>and not be subject to appeal or subject to the grievance procedure of this<br/>Agreement. The committee shall not grant more leave than is contained in<br/>the bank.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVI</p>
<p>JOB-SHARING</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members may participate in job-sharing subject to the<br/>recommendation of the principals/supervisors involved and the approval of the<br/>Superintendent (or designee). Job-sharing is defined as a situation in which a<br/>commitment to one position is shared by two employees who interrelate by sharing<br/>both the responsibility for a specific group of students and adjunct duties required<br/>by that position. Job-shares shall be approved on a year-to-year basis.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the job-sharing involves two (2) employees who are regular employees:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees shall take a percentage leave of absence equal to the<br/>percent of time they will not be working. The vacancy created by two</p>
<p>(2) employees filling one (1) job shall be filled by a temporary employee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-sharing may be terminated at the end of a semester if the<br/>principal/supervisor determines that job-sharing is not in the best<br/>interest of the students. The employees in job-sharing at the time of<br/>termination of the program will be offered positions appropriate to<br/>their full-time equivalent status. The affected temporary employee<br/>will be offered another position consistent with his/her contract.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the job-sharing involves a regular full-time employee and an individual</p>
<p>not yet employed:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular employee shall take a leave of absence equal to the<br/>amount of time s/he will not be working.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new employee shall be given an equivalent percentage<br/>time contract as a temporary employee.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one-half (1/2) time or more employee shall receive the appropriate prorated<br/>District contribution toward a full-time employee's health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees on a job-sharing contract are only required to serve their proportionate<br/>share of the seventy-five percent (75%) of the employee work year as defined in<br/>Article XII Calendar for salary credit advancement. Example: Bargaining unit<br/>member job shares two (2) days a week. Work year is 186/187 days. Full year of job<br/>share would be forty percent (40%) of 186/187 or 75 work days. Seventy-five percent<br/>(75%) of full year job share portion (75 work days) would be 57 days. Assuming that<br/>the bargaining unit member was on the job 57 days, s/he would be eligible for salary<br/>step advancement.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members who desire to job-share may contact the District Human<br/>Resources Office to have their names put on a job-share list. The Human Resources</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Office will make this list available to other bargaining unit members wishing to job<br/>share.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a request for job-sharing is denied, the employees involved may request in writing</p>
<p>that the principal involved meet with the employees and/or provide a written<br/>explanation of the denial. Such meeting and/or explanation shall be scheduled<br/>and/or provided within 30 days of the employee’s request.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been at least six months since either of the two parties has filed a<br/>statement of termination of a previous domestic partnership affidavit with<br/>the San Ramon Valley Unified School District. This prohibition does not<br/>apply if the previous domestic partnership ended due to the death of one<br/>of the partners.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two parties agree to notify the San Ramon Valley Unified School<br/>District Human Resources Office if there is a change in the circumstances<br/>attested to in the affidavit or if the domestic partnership is terminated by<br/>either person.</p>

This benefit coverage is subject to federal and state income tax<br/>and must be reported as imputed income on the employee’s Form W-2. The<br/>District must pay all applicable employer taxes on these amounts and ensure<br/>adequate withholding.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-employee domestic partner and his/her dependent children will have<br/>rights to continue coverage through COBRA as allowed by federal or state<br/>law.</p>

<p>N. Retiree Benefits</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiree is defined as an individual who retires from the San Ramon Valley<br/>Unified School District under the provisions required by STRS/PERS and is<br/>receiving retirement benefits from STRS or PERS.</p>

<p>4. The District contribution may be applied toward medical, dental, vision or life<br/>insurance coverage as permitted by each carrier. The Retiree must make<br/>adequate arrangements for reimbursement to the District for monthly<br/>premium amounts exceeding the district contribution.</p>
<p>The Association and District shall annually participate in a District-wide<br/>Employer/Employee Cost Containment and Benefits Study Committee. The<br/>Committee shall be comprised of representatives from each bargaining unit, as<br/>designated by each unit, one management/confidential representative, and the<br/>District's insurance consultant.

<p>Discipline less than dismissal for all employees shall be in accordance with the<br/>following procedures:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may be disciplined only for just cause.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive discipline shall be utilized except for conduct which is of such a<br/>nature that it injures or threatens to injure the safety of pupils or other<br/>employees, or causes substantial disruption of the educational program.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially the principal or immediate supervisor shall discuss the<br/>employee's acts or omissions with the employee and issue a verbal<br/>reprimand if a personal discussion does not result in corrective conduct.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a verbal reprimand does not result in corrective conduct, a written<br/>reprimand shall be issued.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to administering any formal discipline subsequent to the oral and written<br/>reprimands, an employee shall be provided notice and an opportunity to meet<br/>with the Superintendent or his/her designee. Notice shall include a statement of<br/>the incidents or misconduct which form the basis for disciplinary action and a<br/>statement of the discipline to be imposed. The employee shall be given seven (7)<br/>working days within which to reply, in writing to this notice. The proposed<br/>formal discipline shall not be imposed until after the employee's written reply, if<br/>any, has been received and given consideration by the administration.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If suspension without pay is recommended as a disciplinary action, it shall be<br/>preceded by at least one (1) written reprimand. Exceptions to this standard may<br/>occur where conduct is of such a nature that it injures or threatens to injure the<br/>safety of pupils or other employees or causes substantial disruption of the<br/>educational program. A suspension without pay may not exceed fifteen (15)<br/>working days.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any initial suspension of any employee, pending a disciplinary meeting, shall be<br/>with pay.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may be represented, upon request, at any disciplinary meeting.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All information regarding any actual or proposed disciplinary action shall be<br/>kept confidential by management. Any violation of confidentiality by<br/>management may be grounds for dismissal of all charges and any benefit losses<br/>suffered by the unit members shall be fully restored.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances filed alleging violations of the above sections A-G regarding<br/>discipline less than dismissal may be filed at Level II of the Grievance<br/>Procedure.</p>

<p>Certificated Self-Evaluation - Plan B</p>
<p>Plan B is a self-evaluation option. It was developed to encourage creativity and personal reflection.</p>
<p>Eligibility for Plan B Evaluation is described in detail in the SRVUSD/SRVEA contract. If you plan to</p>
<p>use the Plan B option, please complete this form and give a copy to your administrator by September</p>
<p>30. Listed below are guidelines to help in carrying out self-evaluation:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-evaluation plan will be most useful if it includes objectives, a plan for meeting these<br/>objectives, and a plan for assessing the extent to which the objectives were accomplished.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A self-evaluation plan may have one objective, or it may have several.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan needs to relate to:</p>
<p>• pupil progress towards expected standards of achievement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of instructional methods</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connection to district and/or school curriculum</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of a positive learning environment</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A write-up of the self-evaluation is required. Techniques for recording and assessing progress<br/>vary. Methods often used include written records, logs or journals, collecting samples of<br/>student work, and portfolios.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-evaluation may take a variety of forms, such as a group of teachers choosing the same<br/>objective and working on the objective collaboratively.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The self evaluation plan needs to be completed and reviewed by an administrator by November<br/>1. The final write-up needs to be completed and submitted to the administrator by April 15.<br/>Other than this page, there are no forms that need to be submitted to the District.</p>

<p>SAN RAMON VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTIRCT<br/>SPLIT TEACHING ASSIGNMENT<br/>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>Article XI A. 2. states, ’’There shall be no involuntary split shift.&quot; There will be a concerted effort<br/>to avoid split shifts when developing teaching assignments at each middle and high school.</p>
<p>A split shift is defined as a teacher whose assignment includes an extra period scheduled between<br/>two teaching periods not used for brunch or lunch or as a prep period.</p>
<p>Administrators and teachers understand that there are instances when split shift assignments must<br/>be made because of master schedule and facility constraints. When this occurs, every effort will<br/>be made to eliminate these split shift assignments at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>The teacher's signature on this agreement indicates an understanding of the voluntary nature of<br/>teaching split shift assignments and the impact of a split shift on the seven (7) hour workday. In<br/>addition, both principal and teacher acknowledge that the employee is not required to stay on<br/>campus during the period of time he/she is not either assigned to teach a class or assigned a prep<br/>period as the employee is not in paid status during that time.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Please sign and return to Human Resources</p>
<p>I understand that my teaching assignment includes a split shift that is necessary because of<br/>master schedule, employee request and/or facility constraints. I understand that the<br/>administration will try to eliminate this split assignment at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
