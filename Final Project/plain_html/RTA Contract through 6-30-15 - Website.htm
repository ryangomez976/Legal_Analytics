<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>Contract Revision 01/14</p>
<p>A. The District shall take steps to maintain average class sizes as follows:</p>
<p>TK-3</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>4-5</p>
<p>6-8</p>
<p>P.E.</p>
<p>45 (Middle School)</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their unique characteristics, instrumental music and chorus are<br/>excluded from the class size averages.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that certain specialty programs at middle schools will require class<br/>size limitations due to safety, facility limitations, and curriculum needs.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that unusual and unforeseeable situations sometimes arise which<br/>make it impossible to maintain the above stated averages in the District classrooms.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no case will unusually large classes (those exceeding 34) be maintained for more<br/>than four (4) weeks after the opening of school.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall attempt to keep all classes within the stated averages. The parties<br/>understand that budgetary constraints and availability of classrooms are all primary<br/>factors that affect placement of students in classes.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management will work towards maintaining heterogeneously balanced classes.<br/>Heterogeneous classes are evenly balanced in relation to boys/girls, academic<br/>abilities, differences in behavior and special needs students (including students with<br/>active lEPs or EL students).</p>
<p>Exceptions may exist at particular school sites as a result of collaborative efforts/or<br/>special programs designed to address the unique needs of students and staff.</p>
<p>-13-</p>
<p>Class Size (Cont’d)</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staffing ratio for Speech and Language Pathologists will be 55:1 full-time<br/>SLP based on January/February caseloads plus 10% for growth.</p>
<p>Guidelines for equitable workloads will be established using such factors as, but<br/>not limited to:</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual caseloads at a maximum of 60 students per full-time<br/>Speech/Language Pathologist</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of sites</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographic area to be covered</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel time required</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type and severity of disabling condition</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type and amount of assessment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intervention</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any fourth through fifth grade class at an elementary site that has 30 or more full¬<br/>time students and two or more S.D.C. students are mainstreamed into that class<br/>during the same interval of time, an instructional aide will accompany the students<br/>during their period of time in the general education classroom. Whenever<br/>possible, the instructional aides assigned to the S.D.C. class will accompany the<br/>students. If the classroom S.D.C. aides are unavailable, then all efforts will be<br/>made to provide additional instructional aide time during the specified time the</p>
<p>S.D.C. students are mainstreamed into the general education class.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to maintain reasonable class sizes in Special Day Class<br/>Programs. Sufficient level of staff support will be made available to those classes<br/>with an unusually high number of students.</p>

<p>LEAVE: REQUESTED ABSENCE FROM ASSIGNED DUTIES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a circumstance occurs in which an employee requests permission to miss<br/>service days in order to attend an activity which is of professional interest to that<br/>individual and offers to pay all trip expenses involved, or when an employee<br/>requests permission to miss service days based upon a personal problem to that<br/>individual, the Superintendent is then charged with the responsibility of either<br/>granting or refusing authorization in each circumstance. Such request shall be<br/>made to the Superintendent at least three (3) days prior to the date the individual<br/>requests to be absent from the assigned duties. Further, it is the responsibility of<br/>the Superintendent, if authorization is granted, to consider each request<br/>individually and without precedent to any other like request and render decisions<br/>as to substitute pay responsibility, sick leave deduction, and travel expense with<br/>reference to District responsibility in the matter.</p>

Such an action does not automatically signify that the<br/>absence will be approved. Within three (3) days of returning the employee must<br/>discuss the absence with the Superintendent who will then determine the<br/>appropriate financial decision as if the information had been submitted in advance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent is to have complete authority in all such matters of this nature<br/>and his/her decisions are final so far as the District is concerned and are not<br/>appealable either to the Board of Education or through the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>-42-</p>
<p>Contract Revision 01/14</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXI<br/>LEAVE: SABBATICAL</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectives</p>
<p>Sabbatical leave should be mutually advantageous to the employee and the District<br/>and is considered an investment in the employee's future value to the students,<br/>teachers, and administrators of the District. It may be granted for a period of one</p>
<p>(1) year for study, research-travel and work experience.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>The Board approves sabbatical leave not to exceed one (1) year for employees<br/>who have rendered satisfactory service to the District for at least seven (7)<br/>consecutive years, all of which shall have been served as a full time employee in<br/>the District. Sabbatical leaves granted in any one (1) year shall not exceed one<br/>percent (1%) of the professional staff. Seven (7) years must intervene successful<br/>sabbatical leaves.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution</p>
<p>Prior to each school year, there shall be an annual review of this section of the<br/>sabbatical policy. However, the review shall be confined to determining the financial<br/>feasibility and educational benefits. The sabbatical leave program shall operate<br/>according to established administrative regulations and in keeping with budgetary<br/>limitations. This review shall be conducted by the Sabbatical Leave Committee and<br/>the Superintendent.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Year Defined</p>
<p>For the purpose of sabbatical leave, the school year during which the experience<br/>must occur is hereby defined as the period beginning July 1 and ending June 30 of<br/>the following year.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leaves for Study</p>
<p>1. An employee shall complete at least 24 units of semester college and/or<br/>graduate credit courses during a sabbatical year. At least 12 units or equivalent<br/>shall be completed during each semester or quarter while on leave. This</p>
<p>-43-</p>
<p>Leave: Sabbatical (Cont'd)</p>
<p>unit requirement may be met by study in a foreign country in an accredited<br/>institution. An employee shall have stated purpose and goal for taking<br/>college work so that it would be mutually beneficial to the individual and the<br/>District (i.e., work toward an advanced degree, academic study in depth in a<br/>subject matter in which he/she is teaching, or research projects directly related<br/>to the school or District). Work toward a credential is a personal obligation for<br/>self-advancement and may not mutually benefit the District and should not, in<br/>itself, be grounds for a sabbatical. This does not rule out the possibility of a<br/>person obtaining an advanced credential while completing the objectives of the<br/>sabbatical. Courses shall be subject to approval of the Sabbatical Leave<br/>Committee and Superintendent. Upon completion of the leave, and within sixty<br/>(60) days of the employee's return to duty, a written report on findings and<br/>conclusions along with transcripts usable for reinforcement of teaching in the<br/>subject area shall be submitted for evaluation by the Sabbatical Leave<br/>Committee and the Superintendent. It will then be forwarded to the Board.</p>
<p>2. Leave for study shall be given priority.</p>
<p>F. Sabbatical Leave for Research-Travel</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees on sabbatical leave for research-travel shall remain in this status<br/>at least four (4) months for each semester of leave granted. This application<br/>for leave shall include, in general terms, an outline of the proposed research<br/>and an itinerary of the proposed travel.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name research-travel is used since the primary purpose of this<br/>sabbatical project is research of a nature which must be supplemented with<br/>travel. The research must have a direct contribution to the employee's field<br/>and classroom activity. Sabbatical leave for research-travel must clearly<br/>show reinforcement of knowledge in the subject area through contact with<br/>the people, culture, economy, government, and geography of the countries<br/>visited. This may be done by the employee by identifying a problem and</p>
<p>-44-</p>
<p>Leave: Sabbatical (Cont'd)</p>
<p>defining it to the point where he/she is able to offer evidence that travel and<br/>interaction with people during this research-travel leave will contribute to the<br/>solution of the problem.</p>
<p>The research should be supplemented by films of industrial areas, art<br/>centers, art objects, etc. Upon completion of the leave, and within sixty (60)<br/>days of the employee's return to duty, a written report on findings and<br/>conclusions usable for reinforcement of teaching in the subject area shall be<br/>submitted for evaluation by the Sabbatical Leave Committee and forwarded<br/>to the Superintendent and Board. The employee shall be required to submit<br/>a copy, and copying rights for internal district use, of entire sabbatical report.<br/>The report should set forth the employee's reactions to the experience and<br/>include a statement of the benefits received from it. The Superintendent<br/>may, for good cause, authorize an extension of time for the report, not to<br/>exceed one (1) semester for the purpose of completing the necessary<br/>requirements. A description of the trip alone will not satisfy the report<br/>requirement.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave for Work Experience</p>
<p>A sabbatical leave may be granted to an employee obtaining a year's position in a<br/>field related to his/her teaching area. The relationship and objectives must be<br/>acceptable to the Sabbatical Leave Committee and the Superintendent. Upon<br/>completion of the leave and within sixty (60) days of the employee's return to duty<br/>a written report and an outline of how this experience will be incorporated in the<br/>teaching of the subject area shall be submitted for evaluation by the Sabbatical<br/>Leave Committee and the Superintendent. It will then be forwarded to the Board.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application</p>
<p>1. Application for sabbatical leave must be submitted to the Superintendent,<br/>accompanied by a written recommendation from the principal.</p>
<p>Leave: Sabbatical (Cont'd)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications must include a complete outline of the proposed sabbatical<br/>program and a statement of the way in which the program will benefit the<br/>schools and pupils of the District.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of this policy and regulation does not void the option of<br/>the Superintendent to make recommendations or the Board to grant special<br/>sabbatical leaves in the best interest of the District.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality of projects has first priority. Other guidelines are: Consideration<br/>shall be given to applications which provide the greatest opportunities for<br/>expanding professional contacts, and, in cases of advanced study, breadth<br/>of institutional experiences. Consideration shall be given to the three (3)<br/>leaves of instruction:</p>
<p>Primary teacher (K-3)</p>
<p>Intermediate teacher (4-5)</p>
<p>Middle school teacher (6-8)</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent on sabbatical leave shall be credited as regular District service<br/>in the determination of years of service for sick leave, seniority, and eligibility<br/>for fringe benefits, provided the requirements established for the sabbatical<br/>leave have been satisfactorily met.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee may elect to receive compensation following his/her return<br/>from leave, or in the same manner as if he/she was in active service. The<br/>employee who elects the first option will receive his/her compensation as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave of absence is for a period of one (1) year, the<br/>compensation will be paid in two (2) equal installments during the first<br/>two (2) years of service rendered by the employee in the District<br/>following his/her return from leave;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave of absence is for a period of less than one (1) year, the<br/>total compensation will be paid during the first year of service<br/>rendered by the employee in the District following his/her return from<br/>leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who elects to receive sabbatical leave compensation in<br/>monthly payments during his/her leave must post a bond guaranteeing<br/>service to the District for a period which is equal to twice the period of the</p>
<p>Leave: Sabbatical (Cont'd)</p>
<p>leave, following his/her return from leave.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons returning from sabbatical leave shall serve the District for a period<br/>not less than twice the length of the leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the total time is not served, the employee shall refund sabbatical<br/>leave salary to the District in direct proportion.</p>

These<br/>provisions will take effect on the first day of the next pay period following<br/>notification of said illness to the Superintendent, verified by a medical<br/>doctor's report. Upon release by a medical doctor, the employee will return<br/>to regular duty for the remainder of the school year to be assigned as<br/>needed in a position at the discretion of the Superintendent.

<p>ARTICLE XXII-B<br/>LEAVE: DONATION OF LEAVE FOR CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS</p>
<p>A. Upon written request, certificated employees may donate earned sick leave to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank as eligible leave credits when an employee or that<br/>employee's family member suffers from a catastrophic illness or injury. Open<br/>contribution time will annually occur in May. If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is<br/>depleted of sick leave, contributions may be donated as needed during the school<br/>year. The Personnel Office in cooperation with the Roseville Teachers' Association,<br/>with permission of the requesting employee, will make known to all certificated<br/>employees the need for donations. The donation and receipt of such credits are<br/>subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illness or injury is defined to mean an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate an employee or a member of an employee's family<br/>for an extended period of time, which incapacity requires the employee to<br/>take time off from work to care for that family member for an extended period<br/>of time, and taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for<br/>the employee because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible leave credits are defined to mean sick leave accrued to the donating<br/>employee. An employee cannot donate future sick leave that has not been<br/>accrued. An individual employee may not donate more than forty-five (45)<br/>sick leave days in any one school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family member is defined to mean the employee's spouse, parents, parents-<br/>in-law, siblings, children and stepchildren, or any relative maintaining a bona<br/>fide family relationship living in the immediate household of the employee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who is, or whose family member is, suffering from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury and who is requesting that eligible leave credits<br/>be donated:</p>
<p>-51-</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must submit completed form and provide medical verification to the<br/>Personnel Office. (A family member may submit form and medical<br/>verification if the employee is unable to make a written request<br/>because of the catastrophic illness or injury.)</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must exhaust all accrued paid leave credits.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must use all leave credit that he or she continues to accrue on a<br/>monthly basis before receiving paid leave credits that are donated<br/>under this contract section.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Office will refer eligible employees under the Catastrophic<br/>Leave provisions to the Catastrophic Leave Committee which will consist of<br/>four Roseville Teachers' Association members. To approve an employee's<br/>request for sick leave, there must be three affirmative votes.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who chooses to donate eligible leave credits:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must submit completed form to the Personnel Office of the intent to<br/>transfer the eligible leave credits.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledges that all transfers of eligible leave credits are<br/>irrevocable and binding.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must donate eligible leave credits of a minimum of one day.<br/>Additional eligible leave credits have to be donated in full-day<br/>increments.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible credits donated into a &quot;pool&quot; will be distributed by the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Committee.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Committee will determine the number of<br/>days eligible employees may receive.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For eligible employees, the Catastrophic Leave Bank will supplement<br/>the District provided Income Protection Plan up to maximum of 100%<br/>of salary for one year.</p>
<p>-52-</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For eligible employees, the Catastrophic Leave Bank will provide a<br/>maximum of sick leave for one year to the extent of days available in<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Committee's decision to deny the<br/>employee's request to receive donated leave credits is final and is not<br/>subject to review or appeal under the grievance or any other<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank exhausts all available sick leave, there is no<br/>obligation to provide sick leave to any eligible employees.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the option of the Catastrophic Leave Bank is negotiated out of the contract,<br/>then the District and the Association agree to negotiate how the remaining<br/>sick leave days will be utilized.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association will not be held responsible for the District's determination<br/>of eligibility. The District will not be held responsible for the Association's<br/>distribution of sick leave days in the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIV<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by an employee that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation, or misapplication, of a written provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is an employee duty day.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; is the employee or the Association making the claim.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the principal or supervisor having jurisdiction<br/>over the employee filing the grievance and who has the authority to resolve<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;representative&quot; is an employee or representative of the Association or<br/>legal counsel who participates in this procedure.</p>
<p>B. General</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, solutions to grievances. Both parties agree that these<br/>proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate<br/>at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may present grievances to the District and have such<br/>grievances adjusted without the intervention of the Association as long as<br/>the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement. The<br/>District shall not agree to the adjustment or resolution of a grievance until<br/>the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution, and has been given five (5) days to file a response.</p>
<p>-55-</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure (Cont'd)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the administration to adhere to decision deadlines<br/>constitutes the right for the grievant to appeal automatically to the next<br/>level. Failure of the employee to adhere to the submission deadlines shall<br/>mean that the employee is satisfied with the latest decision and waives any<br/>right to further appeal. Flowever, nothing prevents the parties from<br/>extending the time limit by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of a grievance takes place, the grievant is required to<br/>conform to the original direction of the supervisor.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of<br/>a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to schedule meetings for the processing of<br/>grievances at times which will not interfere with the regular work day and<br/>assignments of the participants. If any grievance meeting or hearing must<br/>be scheduled during the school day, any employee required by either party<br/>to participate as a witness in such meeting or hearing shall be released<br/>from regular duties without loss of pay for the amount of time necessary for<br/>the hearing.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grievance has been filed by an employee, the grievant may<br/>terminate the grievance at any time by giving written notice to the District.<br/>Failure to comply with time limits, to attend scheduled meetings, to discuss<br/>or hear the grievance, or to provide requested information at the grievant's<br/>disposal relating to the grievance shall be deemed a termination of the<br/>grievance by the employee. The District shall give written notice of such<br/>termination to the employee.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant has the right to have a representative present at any formal</p>
<p>-56-</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure (Cont'd)</p>
<p>level. The grievant, however, must be present at each level.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible,<br/>the time limits specified at each level shall be adhered to. The time limits<br/>may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all levels by the last day of the school year, and if left unresolved<br/>until the beginning of the following school year could result in harm to a<br/>grievant or to the District, the time limits will be reduced by agreement of<br/>the parties, so that the procedure may be exhausted as soon as<br/>practicable.</p>
<p>C. Non-Grievable</p>
<p>The following are not grievable:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The termination of services of or failure to reemploy any probationary<br/>employee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The termination of services of or failure to reemploy any employee to a<br/>position for which extra compensation is received.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any claim or complaint for which there is another procedure or forum<br/>established by law or by regulation having the force of law. Examples of<br/>other procedures or forums include, but shall not be limited to: EEOC,<br/>FEPC, Workers Compensation Appeals Board, Unemployment<br/>Compensation Commission.</p>
