<p>It is agreed that members of the bargaining unit, Association, Board of Trustees and<br/>representatives of the Board shall not be subjected to harassment, intimidation, or reprisals<br/>either in connection with their functions as school officials, employees, contractors, or in<br/>connection with their private lives, as a result of this agreement or of negotiations concomitant<br/>to it.</p>
<p>ARTICLE II<br/>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>The Board recognizes the Thermalito Teachers Association as of October 13, 1976 to be the<br/>exclusive representative of the employees' group defined as Thermalito school teachers, school<br/>nurses, counselors and social workers working in temporary, probationary or permanent status.</p>
<p>A &quot;unit member&quot; shall mean any member of the bargaining unit as set forth in this article.</p>
<p>ARTICLE III<br/>ASSOCIATION RIGHTS</p>
<p>The Association shall have the right to make reasonable use of institutional bulletin boards,<br/>mail boxes, and the school mail system, and other District means of communication for the<br/>purpose of posting or transmission of information or notices concerning Association matters.<br/>Such materials shall not be slanderous or libelous in relation to the Governing Board, District<br/>personnel, or District program, nor shall they incite employees to violate rules, regulations, or<br/>past practices of the District or laws that govern the operation of the District. Any written<br/>communication posted or transmitted shall be dated and must identify the organization<br/>responsible for its promulgation.</p>
<p>The Association shall have the right to make reasonable use of school equipment and facilities<br/>at reasonable times, subject to prior scheduling and approval of the administrator in charge.<br/>Such use shall not interfere with any District use. The Association shall pay for all supplies<br/>and reproduction costs as established by the District and shall pay for any damage and for<br/>repairs to equipment or facilities necessitated by such use. Telephones and use thereof are net<br/>covered by this paragraph.</p>
<p>An authorized Association representative shall have the right of reasonable access to District<br/>facilities for the purpose of contacting unit members and transacting lawful Association<br/>business. Upon arrival at a school site, an Association representative who is not a District<br/>employee shall first report to the office of the site administrator and announce his/her presence<br/>and business. In no event shall any representative or unit member interrupt or interfere in any<br/>way with normal work. Contact with unit members shall be limited to non-classroom teaching<br/>hours, such as breaks, duty-free lunch periods and before and after school.</p>

<p>3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall be entitled to address unit members for one (1) hour at the District<br/>orientation meeting at the beginning of each year. The President of the Association shall confer<br/>with the Superintendent regarding the timing of the Association presentation, which shall be<br/>subject to the reasonable control of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A regular Association meeting day after 2:30 p.m., with all District responsibilities met, shall<br/>be scheduled the fourth Wednesday of each month. Except in cases of emergency as<br/>determined by the Superintendent, the District shall not schedule any after-school meeting on<br/>that day which would interfere with unit members' right to attend meeting. The date of the<br/>meeting shall be calendared by the Superintendent and Association President at least 30 days in<br/>advance of the meeting. Other days, upon agreement of the Superintendent and Association<br/>President, may also be scheduled.</p>

<p>ARTICLE IV<br/>ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>4.1 Employee Rights</p>
<p>4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the right of employees to form, join and<br/>participate in lawful activities of employee organizations and the equal, alternative right<br/>of employees to refuse to form, join and participate in employee organizations.</p>
<p>4.2. Association Dues</p>
<p>4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of the Thermalito Teachers' Association,<br/>CTA/NEA, or who has applied for membership, may sign and deliver to the District an<br/>assignment authorizing deduction of unified membership dues, initiation fees, and<br/>general assessments in the Association. Pursuant to such authorization, the District<br/>shall deduct one-tenth (1/1 Oth) of such dues from the regular salary check of the unit<br/>member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit members who sign such<br/>authorization after the commencement of the school year shall be appropriately prorated<br/>to complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance Of Membership</p>
<p>4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have authorized the District to deduct from their pay the normal and<br/>regular Association membership dues, and all employees who so voluntarily authorize<br/>hereafter throughout the term of this Agreement, shall continue their deductions for<br/>Association dues for the life of this Agreement, except that employees may terminate<br/>their payroll dues deduction within a period of thirty (30) days following the expiration<br/>of this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representative Fee</p>
<p>4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member as of April 15, 1996 may choose not to be a member of the<br/>Association.

<p>The Foundation to Assist California Teachers (FACT)</p>
<p>The Oroville Friends of the Library<br/>The United Way</p>
<p>Payment to the designated charity shall be made by monthly payroll deduction or lump<br/>sum cash payment. Proof of cash payment shall be made on an annual basis. Proof of<br/>Payment shall be in the form of receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount<br/>paid, date of payment, and to whom paid, and presented to a designee of the Association<br/>by October 31 of the school year.</p>
<p>4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member not excluded under 4.4.1 who is not a member of the Thermalito<br/>Teachers' Association, CTA/NEA, or who does not make application for membership<br/>within the bargaining unit after the effective date of this Article, shall become a member<br/>of the Association or pay to the Association a representation fee in an amount not to</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>exceed the standard initiation fee, periodic dues and general assessments, payable to the<br/>Association in the same manner as required in this Article. If after 30 days of<br/>employment, a unit member has not notified the District of voluntary payroll deduction<br/>for membership, Agency Fee or a Representation fee, the District shall contact the<br/>Association to determine if the unit member has paid such a fee directly to the<br/>Thermalito Teachers Association. In the event the unit members shall not pay such fee<br/>directly to the Association, or authorized payment through payroll deduction as<br/>provided in Section 4.2, and the District shall immediately begin automatic payroll<br/>deduction as provided in Education Code Section 45061 and in the manner as set forth<br/>in Section 4.2 of this Article. There shall be no charge to the Association for such<br/>mandatory agency fee deductions or regular dues deductions.</p>
<p>4.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting an employee<br/>organization as defined in Section 3540.1(d) of the Government Code shall be<br/>exempted from the requirements of Section 4.4.1, above.</p>
<p>4.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such exempt unit member shall, as an alternative to payment of a representation fee to<br/>the Association, pay an amount equal to such representation fee to one or more of the<br/>charitable funds exempt specified in Section 4.4.1, above. Proof of payment shall be<br/>furnished pursuant to Section 4.4.1.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold Harmless</p>
<p>4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to pay court costs and reasonable legal fees and cost incurred by<br/>the District defending the legality and/or constitutionality of the representation fee<br/>provisions defined herein.</p>
<p>4.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall indemnify and hold the District harmless against judgments that<br/>arise in defending the representation fee provision defined herein.</p>
<p>4.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to meet with the Association to discuss the best course of<br/>action before it implements this hold harmless provision, and to continue such<br/>discussion during the course of any related legal action.</p>
<p>4.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association will have the exclusive right to decide and determine which matters,<br/>referred to in this section shall be comprised, resisted, defended, tried, or appealed.</p>

<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five representatives of the Association shall be allowed reasonable periods of release time for<br/>purposes of meeting and negotiating.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations shall take place at mutually agreed upon times and places.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI<br/>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members agree to work as assigned for 184 days each school year, provided that not more<br/>than 180 days are designated as pupil attendance days. Five (5) consecutive hours of the two<br/>in-service days scheduled before the beginning of the student instructional days will be<br/>scheduled by the Superintendent or designee for use by teachers for room and on-site lesson<br/>preparation.</p>
<p>Teachers shall arrive on site at least 30 minutes prior to class time. Teachers shall remain on<br/>site at least 15 minutes after departure of students. Teachers must be on site for 7 hours<br/>exclusive of a duty-free lunch period of 30 minutes, except as otherwise provided in this<br/>contract.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above terms, certificated staff must be on site: (1) as assigned for yard<br/>duty, (2) in order to meet parent conference responsibilities, and (3) in order to meet<br/>assignments made in light of inclement weather.</p>
<p>The administration agrees to keep assignments for supervision and other non-teaching duties to<br/>those which are necessary for required operational purposes, and to use paid aides, volunteer<br/>aides, and other adequate obtainable resources, when possible.</p>
<p>The administration shall keep teacher assignments for non-teaching supervision of students to a<br/>maximum of 30 minutes per day — no more than 30 minutes before the teacher's first class at<br/>school begins and no more than 20 minutes after the teacher's last class at school ends. The<br/>parties recognize on an ad hoc basis the district may require more supervision time of a teacher.<br/>However, such a requirement will be the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>6.1.1 When the Kindergarten Orientation Program is scheduled before or during the 5<br/>consecutive hours allocated to unit members for preparation in 6.1, affected unit<br/>members will be compensated for up to 5 hours at the Tier #2 contract hourly rate.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the work day noted above, all unit members are to participate as a professional<br/>obligation in Open House, Back to School Night, grade reporting and parent conferencing, and<br/>winter holiday program, the middle school graduation ceremony. The District shall give at least<br/>10 days' advance notice of upcoming events and occasions described above. If less than 10<br/>days’ notice is given, unit members are not obligated to participate.</p>
<p>Examples of the duties included, but not limited to, the following</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>IEP meetings, site council meetings, district or site committees, and staff meetings.</p>
<p>6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may be called upon to perform other duties outside of the regular work day.<br/>This requirement shall not exceed six (6) hours, non-cumulative, per quarter or eight (8)<br/>hours, non-cumulative, per trimester. Any person performing duties pursuant to the<br/>preceding two sentences shall receive, upon request of the person, compensatory time<br/>off.</p>
<p>Compensatory time off shall accrue after three (3) hours of such duties and at a rate of<br/>one and one-half times. Any compensatory time shall be taken off within the school<br/>year in which it was earned. The timing of compensatory time taken must be mutually<br/>agreed upon between the supervising administrator and the employee.</p>
<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to prevent the administration or school board<br/>from requiring scheduled conferences with members of the bargaining unit for job-<br/>related purposes.</p>
<p>6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties required under this section shall be equitably distributed within schools and<br/>departments, and, where possible, on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers not assigned to pupil supervision duties may leave after classes are dismissed on<br/>Friday, and on the days preceding holidays. Teachers not assigned to regular classrooms are<br/>required to remain at work on Fridays and the days preceding holidays, until at least the earliest<br/>departure time of the other staff members in the school of assignment.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Hours of Employment</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases where possible, in-service training for any member of the bargaining unit<br/>shall occur during the duty day.</p>
<p>6.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New teachers shall have no more than 2 additional days for all district-wide meetings,<br/>in addition to the requirements for other teachers.</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule of class dismissals shall be determined by the District after consultation<br/>with the Association in order to implement the agreed upon SB 813 incentive reform for</p>
<p>a longer school day. The dismissal time shall be no later than is required to adjust the<br/>schedule to meet the longer day SB 813 reform, and said dismissal time shall<br/>approximate those in effect for the 1983-84 school year.</p>
<p>Each school day will extended and the additional instructional minutes will be banked<br/>and then used as thirty-three (33) minimum days and three early departure days. Each<br/>day used as an Instructional Development Day will be approximately seventy-five (75)<br/>minutes shorter than the typical instructional day. At no grade level will the actual<br/>annual total instructional minutes drop below what was in effect during the 1999-2000<br/>academic year.</p>
<p>6.4.3.1 Related information on instructional planning or minimum days for 2006-07.</p>
<p>• A day will be used as a parent conference follow-up day, or, if conferences<br/>are complete, the balance of the day may be used for teacher planning time.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>The fall day will be extended by seventy-five (75) minutes.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An early release day immediately prior to spring break is established as an<br/>exchange for the extended day.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sub-committee of both parties will determine the utilization of this<br/>provision through the use of a district-wide survey instrument. Such surveys<br/>will be completed and submitted to a site professional development<br/>representative for tabulations. Copies of the survey results will be given to<br/>the site principal and the bargaining team.</p>
<p>Definition of School Term</p>
<p>The annual school term is hereby defined as the number of working days in the regular school<br/>term, plus institutes and any other days, not to exceed a total of 184, when the employee is<br/>required by the Governing Board to be present at the schools of the District.</p>
<p>Minimum Days</p>
<p>Regular minimum days, scheduled for the purposes of parent conferences in reporting pupil<br/>progress and student advising, faculty meetings. Association meetings, and other<br/>administratively approved purposes, shall be limited to thirty-six (36) days per school term. No<br/>more than two (2) regular minimum days per school term may be used to carry out Association<br/>business.</p>
<p>Preparation Periods: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full-time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;middle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is assigned to a classroom</p>
<p>shall have one (1) preparation period (part-time employees will receive a preparation period based on their<br/>FTE) every day which is duty free and equivalent in length to that of a regular teaching period. During a<br/>unit member’s preparation period, he/she may be asked to volunteer, but he/she shall not be required to<br/>substitute for any other unit member who may be absent, with the exception of a bona fide emergency, such<br/>as a unit member’s sudden illness during a class.</p>
<p>6.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four (4) periods of accumulated substitutions can be used as one-half (1/2) day leave without<br/>regard to reason, subject to prior notice and scheduling approval of the site principal.</p>
<p>6.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six (6) periods of accumulated substitutions can be used as (1) day leave without regard to reason,<br/>subject to prior notice and scheduling approval of the site principal.</p>
<p>6.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduling decisions by the site principal shall be based upon reasonable consideration of the<br/>availability of coverage, or special circumstances requiring the presence of the bargaining unit<br/>member. If the date requested is denied by the site principal, an appeal may be filed with the<br/>superintendent.</p>
<p>6.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensatory days for substitute periods may not be accumulated from year to year, however, any<br/>unused periods remaining in the unit member’s bank of time will be paid off at the tier one hourly<br/>rate per article 13.1.1.3.</p>
<p>6.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the discretion of the unit member, hours used subbing during prep may be used toward the 8<br/>hour obligation time per trimester.</p>
<p>6.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the period schedule changes from the 6 period teaching day, this article will be revised that year.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>CLASS SIZE and PREPARATION PERIODS</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to keep a target level class size at a maximum of 26 pupils per class in grades K-3,</p>
<p>28 in grades 4-5, and 31 in classes in grades 6, 7 and 8, and 40 in P.E. When a class size exceeds the<br/>target level, the District agrees to attempt to reduce the class size to the target level as soon as possible.<br/>If the administration determines that it is unable to so reduce the class size, a communication will be<br/>sent to the affected teacher and the Board stating the reasons for not being able to correct the situation.<br/>As a result of this communication, a meeting shall be held between the principal and the affected<br/>teachers concerning the class size. The purpose of this meeting shall be to attempt to resolve class size<br/>problems. This clause shall not be in effect for the first 20 school days of a given school term.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, it is mutually agreed and understood that all<br/>rights and responsibilities of the children and parents shall be observed as defined by law, and no child<br/>shall be denied admission to a classroom. Mainstreamed students will be included in the total classroom<br/>enrollment in proportion to the amount of time spent in regular classrooms.

<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stipends for Classes Which Exceed the Contractual Limits:</p>
<p>7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Stipend:</p>
<p>In the event that a teacher’s average class size is equal to or greater than 26.5 (K-l) 30.5<br/>(2-3), 32.5 (4-6), based upon the average daily enrollment for any trimester, that teacher<br/>shall be entitled to a $333 stipend for that trimester. To determine “average daily<br/>enrollment”, the total number of actual days of enrollment in the trimester shall be divided<br/>by the total number of days school was in session that period. The figures noted at the<br/>bottom of the official register shall be used. In the event of a combination class, the<br/>stipend will be determined by the class size of the lowest grade level of the combination<br/>class.</p>
<p>7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle School Stipend:</p>
<p>In light of the departmental organization of middle school classes, the following formula will be<br/>used for determining eligibility and amount of the stipend for middle school teachers based on<br/>average daily enrollment for each trimester using the $333 stipend for each trimester.</p>
<p>To determine eligibility for a stipend, the student-teacher ratio will be determined on the number<br/>of academic classes taught per day which exceeds 33.5 students (or 42 in P.E. classes.) The<br/>stipend will be prorated based upon the ratio of academic classes taught which exceed 33 .5<br/>students, (i.e. if three of six class sections exceed 33.5 pupils then 3/6 of the stipend amount.)</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination Classes Stipend:</p>
<p>Teachers in grade level combination classes will be paid $300 or receive three (3) days of preparation<br/>time or any combination of preparation days and payment for additional responsibilities related to<br/>service in a combination class assignment. Arrangements for the user of such time must be mutually<br/>agreed upon in advance with their site principal. Payment for grade level combination classroom<br/>assignments will be made in June.</p>

<p>9.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants</p>
<p>The following certificated personnel will be eligible to participate in an alternative</p>
<p>evaluation system:</p>
<p>9.9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All permanent certificated employees.</p>
<p>9.9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation will be voluntary by the permanent certificated unit member<br/>with the approval of the site administrator.</p>

<p>9.9.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers whose participation in the alternative evaluation program is judged<br/>to detract from the teacher's instructional and professional performance may<br/>be reassigned during the year to the traditional evaluation process as outlined<br/>in Article IX of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the District<br/>and TTA. The administrator must specify to the affected teacher, in writing,<br/>the reasons for the evaluation reassignment.</p>
<p>9.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Process</p>
<p>Goal Setting</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>The certificated employee will develop goals as the foundation for his/her<br/>alternative evaluation option. During the goal setting conference, the site<br/>administrator and the certificated employee will:</p>
<p>9.9.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree on the goals and the selection of the alternative<br/>evaluation option.</p>
<p>9.9.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop timelines for completion.</p>

<p>19</p>
<p>9.9.2.3 Collaboration</p>
<p>The District and TTA believe the most effective professional growth occurs<br/>through collaboration.</p>
<p>The teacher and the site administrator will work together in the selection of<br/>the options and the development of the specific activities.</p>
<p>All participants in the alternative evaluation option will be encouraged to<br/>share the progress and results of their alternative individual or educational<br/>team activities with other colleagues. The time and format of this<br/>collaboration will be developed at each individual site.</p>
<p>9.9.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines</p>
<p>The certificated employee will submit a written alternative evaluation<br/>plan/goals. Timelines are to be predetermined by the participants and the site<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>9.9.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Report</p>
<p>Prior to the end of the year, the teacher and administrator will meet to review<br/>the progress of the selected teacher activities. Both the teacher and the<br/>administrator will provide a written response.

Persons employed<br/>for less than full-time shall be entitled to that proportion of 10 days leave of absence<br/>for illness or injury as the time worked bears to full time. Credit for leave of absence<br/>need not be accrued prior to taking such leave by the employee, and such leave may<br/>be taken at any time during the school year. Sick leave entitlement under this section<br/>shall be accumulative, without limit, from year to year. Every effort will be made by<br/>unit members to schedule medical appointments outside of contracted hours.</p>
<p>11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a member of the bargaining unit is absent from his/her duties on account of<br/>illness or accident for a period of 5 months or less, whether or not the absence arises<br/>out of or in the course of employment, the amount deducted from the salary due<br/>him/her for any month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum which is<br/>actually paid a substitute employee employed to fill his/her position during his/her<br/>absence, or if a substitute employee was not employed, the amount which would have<br/>been paid to the substitute had he/she been employed.</p>
<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of evidence of concerted action against the District or of abuse of sick<br/>leave or a concern by District management over an employee's health, on request of<br/>the Superintendent or his/her designee, a member of the bargaining unit shall furnish<br/>his/her physician's written verification as proof of illness or as verification of the state<br/>of the employee's health.</p>
<p>11.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may also require the bargaining unit member to be examined by a doctor<br/>selected by the District. In the event the District requires an examination by a panel<br/>member, it shall be at District expense and the employee's physician may be in<br/>attendance at the examination. If the District's employee health plan will not cover<br/>the cost of the attendance of the employee's physician, the District will pay the cost.</p>
<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>11.2.1 Employees who have exhausted all fully paid leaves may use donated sick leave under<br/>the following provisions:</p>
<p>11.2.1.1 Donated sick leave shall begin no sooner than the eleventh (11th) work</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>day of absence in the school year, and only after all other personal<br/>accumulated sick leave and other fully paid time-off has been exhausted.</p>
<p>11.2.1.2 Maximum leave is not to exceed twelve (12) consecutive calendar months,<br/>or the maximum number of days donated pursuant to this section,<br/>whichever is less.</p>
<p>11.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To request donated catastrophic leave, the unit member or his/her designee<br/>will submit a request in writing, on forms provided by and approved by the District,<br/>to the Association President stating the facts which require a need for donated leave.</p>
<p>11.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for such sick leave, the employee will have suffered an illness or<br/>injury that is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time,<br/>or that incapacitates a member of the employee's immediate family which requires the<br/>employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time to care for that<br/>family member, and taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the<br/>employee because he/she has exhausted all of his/her sick leave and other paid<br/>time off.</p>
<p>11.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this donated catastrophic leave provision, a member of the<br/>“employees” immediate family shall be as defined in Bereavement Leave (11.3 .2).</p>
<p>11.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as practical, a DSL committee composed of three (3) association<br/>members and the Superintendent or his/her designee, will meet and determine<br/>whether or not the unit member's request shall be approved.</p>
<p>11.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the request is denied, the Association President will notify the unit member<br/>or his/her designee.</p>
<p>11.2.7 If the request is approved, the Association will submit the required forms to the<br/>District.

<p>11.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event an employee exhausts his/her authorized number of donated<br/>catastrophic leave days from the DSL bank, the employee or his/her designee<br/>may request additional DSL pursuant to this section, but not to exceed twelve (12)<br/>consecutive months.</p>
<p>11.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations of catastrophic leave may be made under the following provisions:</p>
<p>11.2.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount a member may donate shall be ten (10) days. A<br/>maximum of one day (7 hours) must be donated but donations may be<br/>made in one (1) hour increments thereafter. Donors may donate an<br/>additional ten (10) days for each request but must maintain fifteen (15)<br/>days for their own needs.</p>
<p>11.2.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member with less than fifteen (15) days accumulated sick leave may<br/>submit a request to the Association President, in writing, to donate a<br/>specified number of days stating the reason why such an exception should</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>be made.</p>
<p>11.2.9.3 Donors shall remain anonymous.</p>
<p>11.2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A notification of approval, or denial, of such a request will be provided to the unit<br/>member, in writing, after the DSL committee has met and reached a decision.</p>
<p>11.2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that days of donated catastrophic leave are not utilized, including<br/>restoration of a balance of up to ten (10) days of accumulated sick leave, the excess<br/>days shall be returned to the donors. The method of returning such excess days of<br/>Catastrophic Leave shall be determined by mutual agreement between the District<br/>and the Association.</p>
<p>11.2.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees that it will not file on its own behalf or on behalf of any unit<br/>member, any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind related to any attempt by a unit<br/>member to retrieve donated catastrophic leave used by another unit member pursuant<br/>to this provision. The Association also agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf<br/>or on behalf of any unit member, any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind which<br/>attempts to challenge in any way the legality or enforcement of this provision.</p>
<p>11.2.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the District from any loss or<br/>damages arising from the implementation of this provision.</p>
<p>11.2.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of any grievance, claim or lawsuit challenging the legality or<br/>enforcement of this provision, the District will provide the Association with thirty<br/>(30) days written notice of termination of the provision.</p>

<p>24</p>
<p>employee's salary the substitute rate for that day.</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Illness or Accident Leave</p>
<p>11.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit shall be allowed industrial accident and illness leave<br/>for up to 60 days during which the schools of the District are required to be in<br/>session, or when the employee would otherwise have been performing work for the<br/>District in any fiscal year, for the same accident. Allowable leave shall not be<br/>accumulated from year to year. Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence<br/>the first day of absence. When a member of the bargaining unit is absent from<br/>his/her duties on account of an industrial accident or illness, he/she shall be paid such<br/>portion of the salary due him/her for any month in which the absence occurs as, when<br/>added to his/her temporary disability indemnity under Division 4 or 4.5 of the Labor<br/>Code, will result in payment to him/her of not more than his/her fully salary. The<br/>phrase &quot;full salary&quot; as utilized in this section shall be computed so that it shall not be<br/>less than employee's average weekly earnings as that phrase is utilized in section<br/>4453 of the Labor Code. For purposes of this section, however, the maximum and<br/>minimum average weekly earnings as set forth in section 4453 of the Labor Code<br/>shall otherwise not be deemed applicable. Industrial accident or illness leave shall be<br/>reduced by one day for each day of authorized absence regardless of a temporary<br/>disability indemnity award. When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into<br/>the next fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only the amount of unused<br/>leave due him/her for the same illness or injury. Upon termination of the industrial<br/>accident or illness leave, the employee shall be entitled to the benefits provided in<br/>section 44977, 44978 and 44983 of the California Education Code, and for the<br/>purposes of each of these sections, his/her absence shall be deemed to have<br/>commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave,<br/>provided that if the employee continues to receive temporary disability indemnity,<br/>he/she may elect to take as much of his/her accumulated sick leave which, when<br/>added to his/her temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her<br/>of no more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>11.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence the employee shall endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability and indemnity checks received on account of his/her industrial<br/>accident or illness. The District in turn shall issue the employee appropriate salary<br/>warrants for payment of the employee's salary and shall deduct normal retirement<br/>and other authorized contributions.</p>

<p>25</p>
<p>11.5.2 Members of the bargaining unit who are summoned to appear in court (other than as<br/>a litigant) or summoned to respond to an official order from duly constituted<br/>government authority, for reasons not arising from the member's own connivance or<br/>misconduct shall be granted paid leave of absence to the extent of the difference<br/>between the member's regular day of pay and the amount allowable as a witness fee.<br/>When the witness fee is allowable, it is the member's responsibility to collect same<br/>and remit it to the District up to the amount of the member's daily pay.</p>
