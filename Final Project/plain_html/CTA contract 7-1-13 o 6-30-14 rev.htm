<p>48</p>
<p>ARTICLE 31 - COMPLAINT PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Purpose - Good morale is maintained, as problems arise, by sincere efforts of all persons concerned, to work<br/>toward constructive solutions in an atmosphere of courtesy and cooperation. The purpose of this procedure is<br/>to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which, may, from<br/>time to time, arise. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may<br/>be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>31.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the importance of a procedure, which allows for timely and<br/>efficient resolution of complaints. They also believe that the quickest and most satisfactory resolution<br/>is one reached at the informal level by the parties directly involved. The purpose of this Article is to<br/>provide a clear procedure for bargaining unit members to follow when making a complaint.</p>
<p>31.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition - A complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction by any classified or certificated employee of<br/>the South Monterey County Joint Union High School District. The employee's dissatisfaction may have<br/>resulted from a misinterpretation, violation or misapplication of existing laws, rules, regulations,<br/>established precedents or procedures, or decisions affecting the said employee of the District.</p>
<p>31.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that complaints be processed as rapidly as possible, the number of days indicated<br/>at each level should be considered as maximum, and every effort should be made to expedite the<br/>process. Time limits, however, may be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>31.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures</p>
<p>31.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complainants should first make contact with the person(s) directly involved and attempt to<br/>reach resolution.</p>
<p>31.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Complainant either does not reach resolution at the informal level or chooses not to<br/>contact the person(s) involved, the Complainant shall file the complaint using either the<br/>District's Uniform Complaint Procedure or the Williams Act Complaint Procedure.</p>
<p>31.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One</p>
<p>A complaint shall first be submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor with the objective<br/>of resolving the matter informally. There shall be a conference within 5 school days of the<br/>complaint being filed and a decision shall be made by the immediate supervisor. The employee<br/>shall be given the decision and it's supporting reasons in writing within 5 school days following<br/>the conference.</p>
<p>31.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two</p>
<p>If the complaint is not settled at level one, it may be appealed in writing within 5 school days<br/>of the level one written decision having been received by the employee. The appeal will be<br/>made in writing to the next designated supervisor in administrative responsibility. There shall<br/>be a conference within 8 school days of the date of the appeal and a decision and it's<br/>supporting reasons in writing within 5 school days following the conference.</p>
<p>31.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>If the complaint is not settled at level two, it may be appealed in writing with 5 school days of<br/>the level two written decision having been received by the employee. The appeal will be made<br/>in writing to the State Administrator/Superintendent. The State Administrator/Superintendent<br/>shall consider the appeal within 35 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. The State<br/>Administrator/Superintendent may decide not to hear oral arguments and may make a<br/>decision solely on the written appeal. The State Administrator/Superintendent shall render a<br/>final decision on the complaint. The employee shall be given the State</p>
<p>Administrator's/Superintendent's decision and it's supporting reasons in writing within 5<br/>school days following the meeting.</p>
<p>31.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Limits</p>
<p>To be recognized at any procedural level, a complaint shall have been presented at the appropriate<br/>level within 20 calendar days of the act (or knowledge of) of omission giving rise to the complaint.</p>
<p>Failure of the complainant to comply with the terms and conditions for appeal from levels one, two or<br/>three shall be considered as a waiver of all appeal rights. Complaints may be subject to other available<br/>legal remedies.</p>
<p>31.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any party in interest may be accompanied at all levels of the complaint procedure by a person of his<br/>own choosing; be represented and have his case presented by such representative, have his employee<br/>organization present the complaint on his behalf, or represent himself.</p>
<p>31.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a complaint shall be made<br/>in writing and properly filed.</p>
<p>By mutual agreement of the parties in interest, procedural levels may be bypassed when such action<br/>would seem to expedite the process.</p>
<p>Forms for filing complaints shall be available at each school site.</p>
<p>All parties involved shall abide by the final decisions in good faith.</p>
<p>If level one or two decisions are appealed, the complaining employee shall state his/her reasons(s) why<br/>the decision at either or both levels is unfair.</p>
<p>If a complaint occurs within the last month of school, the above process may be accelerated by mutual<br/>agreement, may be carried out according to the above time lines, or be carried over to the next school<br/>year by mutual consent.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>32.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall retain the residual rights to any material produced by a district employee within the<br/>scope of a working day or who used District owned property to produce it; conversely, the unit<br/>member will retain any residual rights to any material created by that unit member on his or her own<br/>time.</p>
<p>32.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faculty shall be notified in writing or through e-mail of all vacancies for positions requiring<br/>certification before they are publicly advertised.

While some<br/>students may demonstrate<br/>measurable and significant<br/>progress, a large number of<br/>students may demonstrate<br/>measurable and significant<br/>progress; a large number of<br/>students may have demonstrated<br/>marginal gains or regressed. In<br/>particular, students whose<br/>baseline scores demonstrated<br/>average or above average<br/>performance may have<br/>progressed, while students with<br/>lower baseline assessment scores<br/>may have shown little or no<br/>progress, In self-contained<br/>settings, students may have<br/>demonstrated uniform growth in<br/>one core academic area, yet<br/>shown inconsistent growth in<br/>another.</p></td><td>
<p>Students demonstrate general<br/>patterns of progress towards the<br/>attainment of grade-level<br/>standards according to<br/>performance measures. There is<br/>evidence that students who are<br/>members of special populations<br/>(e.g. ELL, RSP, etc.) are making<br/>progress in academic content<br/>areas or the subject area(s),<br/>though growth may be less, on<br/>the average, than students who<br/>are not members of a special<br/>population. In self-contained<br/>settings there is not a large<br/>discrepancy in overall student<br/>progress between subject areas.</p></td><td>
<p>Students demonstrate a uniform<br/>pattern of progress towards the<br/>attainment of grade-level standards in<br/>subject area(s) taught. Students that<br/>are members of special populations<br/>demonstrate growth according to<br/>assessment results and may show<br/>increases in excess of normal<br/>expectations. The pattern of uniform<br/>progress is consistent among subject<br/>area(s) and the correlation between<br/>grades and assessment results is<br/>strong.</p></td></tr>
