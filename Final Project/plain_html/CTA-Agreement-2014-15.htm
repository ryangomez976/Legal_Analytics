<p>SCHOOL’S AGREEMENT</p>
<p>CERTIFICATED PERSONNEL</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into this 18<sup>th</sup> day of December, 2007, between the<br/>Northern Humboldt Union High School District, hereinafter referred to as the School or<br/>District and the Northern Humboldt Union High School Teachers’ Association (CTA/NEA),</p>
<p>hereinafter referred to as the Association shall be as follows:</p>
<p>ARTICLE I<br/>Purpose</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Agreement is to comply with the Education Employment Relations<br/>Act (EERA), Chapter 10.7 of the California Government Code, as it requires and sets<br/>forth the requirements for meeting and negotiating in California schools.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is the entire, final, complete, full, and fair agreement between the parties<br/>and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, and any representations heretofore<br/>made hereon by the parties or their representatives and concludes the meet and negotiate<br/>process on any and all items, whether included in this Agreement or not, for the term of<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties to the Agreement recognize the non-assignable adjunct duties as specified in<br/>Appendix C or non-assignable extra duties performed by Unit Members shall be<br/>performed only by Unit Members unless there are no Unit Members who are qualified,<br/>available, and interested in performing the work, in which case, the District, at its<br/>discretion, may utilize non-bargaining Unit volunteers or pay and assign non-bargaining<br/>Unit personnel.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2</p>
<p>Association Recognition</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative of all its<br/>certificated employees employed in the following classifications:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Teacher (including RST and Special Day Teachers),</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated School Nurse,</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselor,</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech and Hearing Specialist,</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Librarian,</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary Teacher,</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on leave or sabbatical,</p>
<p>as recognized by the District in its Resolution No. 70653 (1) dated at 5:00 p.m.,<br/>on May 6, 1976, as was submitted to the EERB (now PERB) by Certified Mail on<br/>May 10, 1976. The bargaining unit members are referred to as Unit Members.<br/>Specifically excluded from recognition are school administrators and<br/>management, confidential and supervisory personnel, day-to-day substitutes, adult<br/>education staff, young mothers’ program, home study, persons who evaluate, and<br/>summer school staff.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective the date of this Agreement (February 13, 2001), the school nurse position<br/>within the District may become a classified position in the event that there are no<br/>qualified certificated applicants for the position. If the hired employee receives a<br/>credential, s/he will be placed on the certificated salary schedule. The current employee<br/>in one of these positions was hired as a certificated employee and cannot have his/her<br/>employment status (certificated) changed by the District.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3<br/>Term</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of this Agreement shall be from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the District and the Association shall sunshine their monetary re-openers<br/>simultaneously at the April Board of Trustees meeting.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree to ongoing non-monetary negotiations throughout<br/>the contract year in an effort to be proactive with issues that arise. While no limit on the<br/>number of non-monetary issues has been established, the intent is to keep these<br/>negotiations to four or less per contract year. These non-monetary negotiations may also<br/>be used to revise contradictory or outdated contract language.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4</p>
<p>Management Rights</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed the District reserves and hereby retains all its powers,<br/>authority, and control to the full extent permitted by law, except as specifically delegated<br/>or limited by the expressed provisions of this Agreement. The District's authority to<br/>direct, manage, and control is defined as matters involving hiring, directing the work<br/>force, determining the utilization of facilities and equipment, determining District<br/>policies, District goals or objectives, developing the District budget, modifying the<br/>revenues, and determining the existence of an emergency, raising revenues, and<br/>determining the educational curriculum. The exercise of such direction, management,<br/>and control shall be consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Nothing stated in this Article shall be construed to mean that the Association has waived<br/>its right to bargain issues or the impact or effect of issues within the scope of<br/>representation under the EERA nor has the Association waived its right to consult with<br/>the District.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5<br/>Unit Members’ Responsibilities</p>
<p>Unit Members will devote such time as may be necessary to prepare to teach their<br/>assigned subjects effectively.</p>
<p>Each Unit Member shall be responsible to have adequate plans or instructions available<br/>to substitute teachers to allow day-to-day substitute teachers to continue the educational<br/>continuity for at least a two-day absence.</p>
<p>Once each school year each Unit Member shall prepare and file with the school principal<br/>a classroom discipline plan and a copy of the class grading policy.</p>
<p>Teacher dress shall reflect their professional status in the community. In the event that<br/>there is an issue regarding the dress of an employee, the site administrators will address<br/>the concern on an informal basis.</p>
<p>Certificated faculty are expected to assist in promoting the school as a safe and positive<br/>environment through such measures as being a presence out in the halls between classes,<br/>as well as at lunch, before and after school, and during passing time between classes;<br/>opening classroom doors while classes are changing; encouraging students to get to class<br/>on time; being a visible presence on the campus during the school day as able; and<br/>through addressing students on inappropriate behaviors as they are noticed. The intent of</p>
<p>this provision is to have all faculty share in developing and promoting a positive school \<br/>culture and climate through campus supervision as a part of our professional<br/>responsibility.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6<br/>Grievance Settlement Procedure</p>
<p>Only grievances arising from a violation of the specific provisions of this Agreement<br/>shall be resolved pursuant to the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a claim by the Association or by one or more Unit</p>
<p>Members that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or<br/>misapplication of a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person or persons, including the Association,</p>
<p>making the claim.</p>
<p>6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member duty day.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible</p>
<p>administrative level, solutions to the problems which may, from<br/>time to time arise, affecting the wel fare of working conditions of<br/>Unit Members. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be<br/>kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any step<br/>of the procedure.</p>
<p>Procedure</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;settled in the following maimer:</p>
<p>Step 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with or without representation, shall</p>
<p>first discuss the grievance with the site Principal for<br/>the purpose of achieving a mutually acceptable<br/>solution.</p>
<p>Step 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the occurrence of the discussion</p>
<p>described under Step 1, the matter shall then<br/>become an official grievance. Official grievances<br/>shall be reduced to writing on a District-provided<br/>form, setting forth the substance of the grievance<br/>identifying the specific provision of this Agreement</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Step 4:</p>
<p>Step 5:</p>
<p>allegedly violated, stating the specific remedy<br/>sought, and the date on which this Agreement was<br/>first violated.</p>
<p>To receive further consideration, an official<br/>grievance must be signed by the Grievant, or the<br/>Grievanf s representative, and submitted to the site<br/>Principal within twenty (20) days after the Grievant<br/>first knew, or should have known, of tire facts that<br/>led to the grievance, or six (6) calendar months after<br/>the first alleged violation of this Agreement,<br/>whichever comes first.</p>
<p>Within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of an<br/>official grievance, the Principal shall prepare and<br/>give the Grievant the Principaf s written response.</p>
<p>In the event the Grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>Principal’s response, within ten (10) days after the<br/>Principal's response, the Grievant may appeal the<br/>decision on a form provided by the District for this<br/>purpose to the Superintendent. The Superintendent<br/>will prepare a written Superintendent’s decision<br/>within ten (10) days after receipt of the appeal and<br/>provide copies to the Grievant and the Association<br/>(if the Association is not the Grievant).</p>
<p>If the Grievant is not satisfied with the decision at<br/>Step 4, within five (5) days after the Superinten¬<br/>dent’s decision, the Grievant may submit a written<br/>request to the Superintendent for arbitration of the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>The Grievant and the District shall attempt to agree<br/>upon an arbitrator. If no Agreement can be reached,<br/>they shall request the State Conciliation Service to<br/>supply a panel of five (5) names of persons<br/>experienced in hearing such matters in public<br/>schools. Each party shall alternately strike a name<br/>until only one name remains. The remaining panel<br/>member shall be the arbitrator. The order of<br/>striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the<br/>expenses of the hearing shall be borne equally by<br/>the District and the Grievant. All other expenses<br/>shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>-5-</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear<br/>evidence and render a decision on the grievance. If<br/>the parties cannot agree upon a submission<br/>agreement, the arbitrator shall determine the issues<br/>by referring to the written grievance and the<br/>answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract<br/>from, or modify the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>After a hearing, and after both parties have had an<br/>opportunity to make written arguments, the<br/>arbitrator shall submit written findings and a<br/>decision to all parties.</p>
<p>The arbitrator’s decision shall be binding on the<br/>parties.</p>
<p>6.5 General Provisions</p>
<p>6.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedural time limits may be extended only by a mutual<br/>written agreement.</p>
<p>6.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of prompt and orderly settlement of a grievance,<br/>grievances not timely submitted or not pursued within the time<br/>limits or pursuant to the procedures contained herein, shall be<br/>dismissed.</p>
<p>6.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievance not timely or properly referred to the next higher<br/>step shall be deemed settled on the basis of the decision rendered at<br/>the preceding step.</p>
<p>6.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As necessary, the Grievant and needed witnesses will be given<br/>release time to attend the arbitration hearing under Step 5.</p>
<p>6.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the District, its officers,<br/>agents or employees against any Grievant, or any other person, as a<br/>result of filing, not filing, participating in, or not participating in,<br/>any grievance. No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the<br/>Association, its officers, agents or employees against any Grievant,<br/>or any other person, as a result of filing, not filing, or participating<br/>in, or not participating in, any grievance.</p>
<p>6.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of<br/>any person having a grievance to discuss the matter informally<br/>with any appropriate member of the administration and to have the<br/>grievance individually adjusted without intervention by the<br/>Association or resort to this process.</p>
<p>-6-</p>
<p>6.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be represented at all stages of the grievance</p>
<p>procedure, except Step 5, by the Grievant alone or, at the<br/>Grievant’s option, by the Association or its representative. The<br/>Association shall have the right to be present and to state its views at all<br/>stages of the grievance procedure. Representation of Step 5 will be by the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>6.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a</p>
<p>member of the administration at a level above the Principal or<br/>immediate supervisor, the Grievant shall submit the grievance to<br/>the Superintendent and the Association directly and the processing<br/>of such grievance will be commenced at the fourth step.</p>
<p>6.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association may process a grievance through all steps of the</p>
<p>grievance procedure even though an individual Grievant does not<br/>wish to appeal at Step 2 or higher.</p>
<p>6.5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;documents,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and records dealing with the</p>
<p>processing of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file<br/>and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the participants.</p>
<p>6.5.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be</p>
<p>processed through all the steps in the Grievance Procedure by die<br/>end of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of<br/>the following school year, could result in harm to a Grievant, the<br/>time limits set forth herein may be reduced by mutual agreement<br/>so that the procedure may be completed prior to the end of the<br/>school year or as soon as practicable following the close of the<br/>school year.</p>

Effective with the 2001-02 school year, full-time members will serve a<br/>maximum of five (5) adjunct duty event supervisions, with graduation being one (1) of<br/>the adjunct duties required by the District of counselors and senior class advisors. Part-<br/>time Unit Member assignments will be prorated. Club advisors of Principal/AS B-<br/>approved clubs will serve one (1) less adjunct duty, meaning that a Unit Member who is<br/>an approved club advisor will serve no more than four (4) duties. Unit members<br/>designated as senior head class advisors will be credited with five (5) adjunct duties, but<br/>they will attend all senior activities (including graduation). All other head class advisors<br/>will be credited with two (2) adjunct duties. Adjunct duty event supervisions shall not<br/>include athletic event duty that is related only to the conduct of the contest itself. (This<br/>means that a Unit Member’s duty will not be to do something such as officiate the event.)</p>
<p>7.7.1 Unit Members who are also ASB approved club advisors may receive a reduction<br/>of one (1) adjunct duty per approved ASB club up to a maximum of two (2) duty<br/>reductions, regardless of whether the Unit Member is the advisor of more than<br/>two clubs. For a full time Unit Member, this means that the least amount of duties<br/>will be three (3), unless the Unit Member is a travelling teacher, a counselor, or a<br/>senior class advisor.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Unit Member who is not on a preparation period, unless excused, shall<br/>attend all school rallies, assemblies, etc., held during the day.</p>
<p>7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements for coverage for curriculum related absences will continue to be<br/>made as provided for in District policies and rules on a voluntary basis. The<br/>District will not change these policies and rules without bargaining.</p>
<p>-10-</p>
<p>Unit Members, with the agreement of the school Principal, District Superintendent or<br/>their designees, may otherwise volunteer to teach a class during their prep period for<br/>other Unit Members.</p>
<p>The District may assign coverage for absences due to emergencies (e.g. illness or<br/>accident). The District shall pursue every means possible to assign the coverage<br/>from the substitute list. Every effort shall be made by the site administration to<br/>keep the number of times a faculty' member can be asked to provide coverage due<br/>to an emergency to five (5) occasions or less per year.</p>
<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors will be on duty up to five (5) days which are not normal Unit Member<br/>duty days which will be scheduled in the week before the opening of school,<br/>workshop day, for one Saturday testing day, and for one regular work day after<br/>graduation. Counselors shall not be required to work in excess of 182 days. The<br/>Counselors will schedule the regular Unit Member duty day that they will not<br/>work with the approval of the District.</p>
<p>7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No outside applicant shall be selected to fill a vacancy or a newly-created,<br/>compensated extra duty Unit position if there is a Unit Member applicant with the<br/>proper credentials and experience to fill the position. If no qualified staff member<br/>should apply for one of the extra-duty positions, the District may fill the position<br/>from outside the Unit. The District may use non-Unit Member volunteers to<br/>assist Unit Members in supervision of adjunct duties.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 25</p>
<p>Professional Freedom and Responsibilities</p>
<p>25.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Agreement, the term “&quot;professional freedom” shall be understood<br/>to mean that freedom which promotes a climate of freedom encouraging the exchange of<br/>ideas with the recognition that freedom to teach implies both rights and responsibilities<br/>which are protected under the framework of the law and the educational tradition,<br/>especially as it reflects the Teachers’ Code of Ethics. This freedom does not relieve the<br/>employee of the obligation to observe administrative or board direction, so long as either<br/>or both are in compliance with both the State Standards and the law.</p>
<p>25.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal and Professional Freedom</p>
<p>25.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a policy of the District that all instruction shall be fair, accurate,</p>
<p>objective and appropriate to the age and maturity of the student(s) and<br/>sensitive to the community needs and the needs and values of our diverse<br/>cultures and heritages. Professional freedom is essential to the fulfillment<br/>of this policy and the District acknowledges the fundamental need to<br/>protect Unit Members from any censorship or restraint which might<br/>interfere with the Unit Members’ performance of their teaching<br/>obligations.</p>
<p>25.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member shall have freedom in classroom<br/>presentations and discussions and may introduce political,<br/>religious or otherwise controversial material, provided that<br/>said material is relevant to the State Standards and within<br/>the scope of the law.</p>
<p>25.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing teaching duties. Unit Members shall have<br/>freedom to express their opinions on all matters relevant to<br/>the course content in an objective maimer. A Unit<br/>Member, however, shall not utilize his/her position to<br/>indoctrinate pupils with his/her own personal, political,<br/>and/or religious views.</p>
<p>25.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be employed, promoted or retained without</p>
<p>discrimination or harassment regarding their personal opinions or their<br/>scholarly, literary or artistic endeavors.</p>
<p>25.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life of a Unit Member is not an appropriate concern of the</p>
<p>District for purposes of evaluation or disciplinary action unless it prevents<br/>the Unit Member from performing his/her duties.</p>
