<p>Article I<br/>Introduction</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article and the provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>agreement by and between the San Miguel Joint Union School District (&quot;District&quot; or<br/>&quot;Employer&quot;) and the San Miguel Teachers Association (&quot;Exclusive Representative&quot; or<br/>&quot;Association&quot;), an employee organization.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Sections 3540-3549 of the Government<br/>Code (&quot;the Act&quot;).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall supersede any rules, regulations, or practices of the District<br/>which are inconsistent with its terms. Rules designed to implement this Agreement<br/>shall be uniform in application.</p>
<p>Article II<br/>Recognition</p>
<p>A. The Employer recognizes the Association as the Exclusive Representative of all<br/>credentialed bargaining unit members exclusive of management, supervisory,<br/>confidential and substitute employees (“Unit Members”).</p>
<p>Article III<br/>Salary</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Certificated Salary Schedules for the school years covered by this Agreement<br/>are attached as Appendix A. The 2011-2012 school year Salary Schedule shall be the<br/>same as the 2010-2011 Salary Schedule. The 2012-2013 school year Salary Schedule<br/>shall be the same as the 2011-2012 Salary Schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Placement and Longevity. For the term of this Agreement, step increments<br/>shall be granted to those Unit Members who qualify.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Unit Member is initially hired by the District, the Unit Member shall be given<br/>up to four years of credit for prior teaching experience. The four years of teaching<br/>must have been within the preceding ten years. The Unit Member’s maximum<br/>placement shall be at Step 5 on the Salary Schedule.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent in unpaid leave status shall not count toward advancement on the Salary<br/>Schedule.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement on the first step of the Salary Schedule is based on the completion of a<br/>bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university with no additional<br/>approved units and with no creditable years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>Page -1-</p>
<p>C. Column Placement. For the purposes of this Article, the following terms or<br/>conditions are defined:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units are defined as semester units. Quarter units are converted to semester<br/>units by applying the factor of 2/3.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Salary Schedule advancement only, Continuing Education Units and<br/>credit for study other than accredited college units shall be granted at the rate<br/>of 54 hours of study or class work for one semester unit equivalent; for<br/>example 18 hours of Unit Member contact plus 36 hours of home or other<br/>study or activity.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for pass-fail courses, courses shall not be eligible for salary credit<br/>unless earned with a grade of “C&quot; or higher.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verifying completion of course work will be done by submitting transcripts or<br/>other official documents.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units and degrees will be accepted only from accredited colleges and<br/>universities. For purposes of this Article and Appendices, accredited colleges<br/>and universities are defined as those from which units are accepted by the<br/>California Commission for Member Preparation and Licensing.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to college units taken for credit on the salary schedule, the units<br/>must be upper division or graduate level courses. A Unit Member may<br/>request credit for a lower division course which is applicable to his/her<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units to be credited for salary placement shall be related to the Unit Member’s<br/>assignment. The Superintendent may approve courses that are not related to<br/>the Unit Member’s assignment but that, in the Superintendent’s opinion, lead<br/>to the Unit Member’s improvement of classroom instruction, job performance,<br/>communication, child development, or additional educational credential or<br/>degree.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Placement for Course Work. When Unit Members are initially employed in the<br/>District, their transcripts will be evaluated by the Superintendent to determine which<br/>graduate courses completed, in addition to those required for a bachelor’s degree,<br/>will be accepted for salary placement purposes.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Unit Member’s responsibility to provide the District with verification of<br/>request for official transcripts within the first 30 days of paid service. Any transcripts<br/>received after 90 days will not be used for salary placement for the current school<br/>year and a result in payroll deductions if the initial placement was incorrect.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduate units related to the Unit Member’s teaching assignment earned prior to<br/>the time the Unit Member received a bachelor’s degree shall be granted for salary<br/>schedule placement at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancement For Salary Placement. Units shall be credited as they are earned,<br/>subject to the conditions specified below.</p>
<p>a. Notice of intent to qualify for a higher class must be filed with the District by<br/>May 1 of each year.</p>
<p>Page -2-</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be applicable for salary schedule placement purposes for the school year, an<br/>official transcript of courses completed or a statement signed by the instructor or the<br/>registrar of the college or university that the course has been satisfactorily<br/>completed will be required no later than the last workday before October 15. Failure<br/>to observe this deadline shall cause the crediting of the units to be held to the next<br/>school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be credited for placement on the salary schedule, accredited college courses,<br/>including Continuing Education units, must be approved by the Superintendent prior<br/>to completion of the courses.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for credit for study from non-accredited institutions shall be acceptable<br/>only with the written approval of the Superintendent prior to the beginning of study.<br/>An official letter verifying satisfactory participation and hours of study from the<br/>offering group or instructor must be provided at the conclusion of the course.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Unit Members shall be entitled to utilize sick leave for the period of time<br/>required to be absent due to pregnancy or childbirth.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of leave, including the date upon which the leave shall begin, shall be<br/>determined by the Unit Member and her doctor based solely on the Unit Member's<br/>physical ability to render service to the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement from the Unit Member's doctor as to the beginning date of the leave<br/>shall be filed with the Superintendent.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of the Unit Member's return to service shall be based upon her doctor's<br/>analysis and written verification of the Unit Member's physical ability to render<br/>service to the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at the beginning of the school year the Unit Member's accumulated sick leave total<br/>was less than five school months (i.e., 100 days), and if the accumulated sick leave<br/>is used up within the school year, the Unit Member shall be entitled to paid extended<br/>sick leave beginning on the first day following exhaustion of regular and<br/>accumulated sick leave on the following basis:</p>
<p>a. Upon written verification of illness or incapacity by a physician, the amount of<br/>salary deduction in any month shall not exceed:</p>
<p>(1) The sum which was actually paid a substitute in the position, or</p>

<p>(2) If no substitute was employed, the amount which would have been paid to a<br/>substitute had one been employed for the remainder of the illness up to a total<br/>period of five school months.</p>
<p>b. The maximum period of time for which a Unit Member may be granted a paid<br/>leave of absence combining regular sick leave, accumulated sick leave, and<br/>extended sick leave shall be five school months.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the immediate family.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving the person or property of the Unit Member or the person or<br/>property of a member of the immediate family. The accident must be of such a<br/>serious nature that the immediate presence of the Unit Member is required.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required appearances in court during normal work hours under official order as a<br/>litigant or witness.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such other reasons as approved by the Superintendent on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to three days of this leave may be taken for an unspecified reason.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member shall not be required to secure advance permission for leave taken<br/>for the reasons set forth in paragraphs B.1 .a.-b. of this Article. However, in all other<br/>instances, advance written notice of the Unit Member's intention to take such leave<br/>shall be required.</p>
<p>Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Unit Member shall be entitled to three days of paid non-cumulative leave of<br/>absence, or five days if travel in excess of 350 miles one way is involved, because of<br/>the death of any member of the Unit Member's immediate family. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall require the use of bereavement leave before personal necessity<br/>leave days are used for purposes allowed in this paragraph.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leave shall not be deducted from sick leave.</p>
<p>Industrial Accident and Illness Leave</p>
<p>D. A Unit Member shall be entitled to industrial accident or illness leave for any job-<br/>related accident or illness in the amount of up to 60 days during which school is</p>
<p>Page -9-</p>
<p>required to be in session or when the Unit Member would otherwise have been<br/>performing work for the District in any one fiscal year for the same accident. Such leave<br/>shall not be cumulative.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such benefits shall be in addition to other sick leave benefits provided by the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entitlement to this leave has been exhausted, other sick leave shall be<br/>utilized.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members shall report all job-related injuries and illnesses to the District within<br/>24 hours of the occurrence, whenever possible, regardless of whether or not medical<br/>attention is required or whether or not time is lost from work. In the event the Unit<br/>Member's injury or illness prevents the filing of the report within the time limit, the<br/>report shall be filed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person employed in a position requiring certification qualifications is absent<br/>from duty because of an industrial accident, the Unit Member shall be paid such<br/>portion of the salary due the Unit Member for any month in which the absence<br/>occurs as, when added to temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment of<br/>not more than the Unit Member's full salary.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each day that the Unit Member is absent and receiving Workers' Compensation<br/>payments, the District shall charge the Unit Member's available leave only for that<br/>portion of a day represented by the difference between the full day's pay and the<br/>amount of daily pay represented by the Workers' Compensation payment endorsed<br/>to the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the<br/>Unit Member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due for the same<br/>illness or injury.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the Unit Member shall endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of the industrial accident<br/>or illness. The District, in turn, shall issue the Unit Member's appropriate salary<br/>warrants for payment of the Unit Member's salary and shall deduct normal retirement<br/>and other authorized contributions.</p>

<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this Article, immediate family shall be defined as: mother, father,<br/>grandmother, grandfather, or grandchild of the Unit Member or the spouse of the Unit<br/>Member, and the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother, brother-<br/>in-law, stepson, foster son, stepdaughter, foster daughter, sister, sister-in-law,<br/>stepbrother, or stepsister of the Unit Member, or any person living in the immediate<br/>household of the Unit Member.

<p>Provisions for Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members on paid leaves of absence shall have health and welfare benefits as<br/>described in Article IV throughout the duration of the leave of absence. Unit Members<br/>on unpaid leaves of absence may, as long as the practice is allowed by the insurance<br/>company, continue their health and welfare program by paying to the District the<br/>amount of money equal to the premiums for the various fringe benefits.</p>
<p>Return From Leave</p>
<p>K. Upon return from Disability-Pregnancy, Extended Illness, or Industrial Accident<br/>leave, an effort will be made to reinstate the Unit Member to the position held at the time<br/>leave was granted or to as nearly identical a position as possible. If it is determined by<br/>the Superintendent that, in order to meet the educational-related needs of the District, it<br/>is necessary to place the returning Unit Member in a different position, such placement<br/>shall be made.</p>
<p>Transfer of Accumulated Sick Leave</p>
<p>Page -11-</p>
<p>L. Certificated Unit Members who have accumulated illness and accident leave with<br/>school districts or county superintendents in California may transfer the unused portion<br/>of such leave to the new district of employment pursuant to Education Code section<br/>44976. The responsibility for initiating the request for transfer rests with the Unit<br/>Member.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation shall relate to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of pupils toward the standards established pursuant to Education<br/>Code §44662(a) and, if applicable, the state adopted academic content standards as<br/>measured by state adopted criterion referenced assessments;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the Unit Member;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member's adherence to curricular objectives; and</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment within the<br/>scope of the Unit Member's responsibility.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations shall take place at least once each year for probationary Unit Members,<br/>at least once every other year for permanent Unit Members and at least every five<br/>years for permanent Unit Members who meet all of the criteria in Education Code<br/>§44664(a)(3):</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employed by the District for 10 years;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching in a position required to be filled by a “highly qualified professional”<br/>by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous evaluation rated the Unit Member as meeting or exceeding<br/>standards; and,</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator and Unit Member agree to the five-year cycle. (The certificated<br/>Unit Member or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time.)</p>
<p>The evaluation shall be transmitted to the Unit Member not less than 30 days before<br/>the last school day scheduled on the school calendar.</p>
<p>San Miguel CTA (2011-2013)</p>
<p>Page -12-</p>
<p>3. Evaluation Options. With the approval of his or her designated evaluator, a</p>
<p>permanent Unit Member may utilize one of the following assessment techniques in<br/>place of the regular evaluation process:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partner Peer Review. (Two or more Unit Members review each other, and a<br/>meeting is held with the evaluator after observations to discuss observations,<br/>and complete and sign evaluation forms.)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-evaluation/Portfolio. Portfolio would include lesson plans, student work,<br/>video of a lesson, etc. (A meeting is held afterwards with the evaluator to<br/>discuss observations, and complete and sign evaluation forms.)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review by other agreed upon Unit Member. (A meeting is held with the<br/>evaluator after observations to discuss observations, and complete and sign<br/>evaluation forms.)</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Unit Member shall select or develop tentative instructional goals and objectives<br/>for meeting the established standards of student achievement for each school year in<br/>which the evaluation takes place. The tentative instructional goals and objectives shall<br/>be submitted to the Unit Member’s designated evaluator by October 15 for approval or<br/>revision.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members who were hired after the beginning of school or Unit Members whose<br/>job duties were modified during the school year shall have a reasonable amount of<br/>time beyond the fourth week to complete their tentative goals and objectives.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before revising any Unit Member's instructional goals and objectives, the evaluator<br/>will schedule a meeting with the Unit Member to discuss and to attempt to mutually<br/>agree on the final goals and objectives upon which the evaluation is to be based.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Unit Member fails to submit tentative goals and objectives in a timely manner,<br/>or no agreement is reached as to such goals and objectives, the evaluator shall<br/>establish them.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the initial evaluation for each school year, the evaluator and the Unit<br/>Member shall meet for a pre-evaluation conference to discuss the instructional goals<br/>and objectives, the evaluation process and communication procedures. If during the<br/>course of the evaluation period the Unit Member or the evaluator allege in writing that<br/>mitigating circumstances have arisen and he/she sets forth in detail the nature of those<br/>circumstances which are alleged to invalidate the instructional goals and objectives, the<br/>Unit Member and evaluator shall meet upon the request of either of them to review the<br/>instructional goals and objectives. Any modification shall be by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the initial written evaluation for the school year, there should be at least two<br/>formal classroom observations by the evaluator which preferably cover the major<br/>portion of a class period, unless circumstances do not permit the formal observations<br/>due to the Unit Member's long-term absence from the classroom, reassignment, or<br/>other reasonable cause.</p>
<p>Page -13-</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summation conference shall be held as soon as practicable following each formal<br/>classroom observation. It is recommended that the conference be held within three<br/>days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal classroom observations shall be scheduled at least two days in advance.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evaluation, the evaluator shall cite specific qualities, abilities, and/or<br/>deficiencies.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member and evaluator shall meet to review the evaluation as soon as<br/>practicable after its completion.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the review, the Unit Member shall sign the evaluation to indicate that it has<br/>been reviewed and that the Unit Member has received a copy. The Unit Member's<br/>signature does not necessarily signify agreement with the evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member may prepare and submit a written response to the evaluation<br/>within ten days of the review. After the ten-day response period has expired, the<br/>formal written evaluation shall be placed in the Unit Member's file. The response, if<br/>any, shall become a permanent attachment to the evaluation form.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the formal written evaluation indicates that a Unit Member is not<br/>performing satisfactorily in any area, the evaluator shall describe the specific areas of<br/>less than satisfactory performance either in the evaluation or in a separate document.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the initial evaluation for each school year, the evaluator shall meet with the Unit<br/>Member and make specific recommendations as to areas of improvement in the Unit<br/>Member's performance and endeavor to assist in the improvement of such<br/>performance should the evaluation indicate such a need. The evaluator shall meet<br/>with the Unit Member and assist in the development of a plan designed by the Unit<br/>Member to alleviate any less than satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator may provide, or the Unit Member may request, further continued<br/>periodic observations and conferences.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in the opinion of the evaluator, subsequent Unit Member performance improves<br/>significantly in the area of identified deficiencies, a notification to that effect shall be<br/>attached to the evaluation.</p>
<p>FI. While a grievance may be filed alleging a violation of the procedural steps of this<br/>Article, no grievance may be filed regarding the contents of a written evaluation.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Unit Member may, at any time, present grievances to the District and have such<br/>grievances adjusted without the intervention of the Exclusive Representative as long as<br/>the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,<br/>that the District shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the Exclusive<br/>Representative has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and<br/>has been given an opportunity to file a response.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to abide by Government Code Section 3546.3, which states:</p>
<p>&quot;Notwithstanding subdivision (I) of Section 3540.1, Section 3546, or any<br/>other provision of this chapter, any employee who is a member of a<br/>religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to<br/>joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be<br/>required to join, maintain membership in, or financially support any<br/>employee organization as a condition of employment; except that such<br/>employee may be required, in lieu of a service fee, to pay sums equal to<br/>such service fee either to a nonreligious, non-labor organization,<br/>charitable fund exempt from taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of<br/>the Internal Revenue Code, chosen by such employee from a list of at<br/>least three such funds, designated in the organizational security<br/>arrangement, or if the arrangement fails to designate such funds, then to<br/>any such fund chosen by the employee. Either the employee organization<br/>or the public school employer may require that proof of such payments be<br/>made on an annual basis to the public school employer as a condition of<br/>continued exemption from the requirement of financial support to the<br/>recognized employee organization. If such employee who holds<br/>conscientious objections pursuant to this section requests the employee<br/>organization to use the grievance procedure or arbitration procedure on<br/>the employee's behalf, the employee organization is authorized to charge<br/>the employee for the reasonable cost of using such procedure.&quot;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizations specified pursuant to paragraph F.3 of this Article are:</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no grievance filed alleging a violation of the terms of this Article<br/>unless it is alleged that the exercise of failure/refusal to exercise any reserved right,<br/>power, prerogative and/or authority has resulted in an alleged violation of another Article<br/>of this Agreement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exercise of its discretion, the District will not act in an arbitrary, capricious or<br/>discriminatory manner.</p>
<p>Unit Member Discipline</p>

<p>Completion of Negotiations</p>
<p>A. This Agreement represents complete collective bargaining and full agreement by the<br/>parties in respect to wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of<br/>employment which shall prevail during the term or terms hereof.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except by mutual agreement, the parties expressly waive and relinquish the right to<br/>meet and negotiate with respect to any subject or matter, even though such subject<br/>or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either party<br/>at the time they met and negotiated on and executed this Agreement and even<br/>though such subjects or matters were proposed and later withdrawn.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees that it will not change any &quot;term and condition of employment&quot; as<br/>defined in Section 3543.2 of the Act without first notifying the Association of such<br/>intended change.

<p>Past Practice</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific provisions of this Agreement shall prevail over any past practice or<br/>procedure. When references are made to statutes (e.g., Education Code), such<br/>reference is informational only and does not subject the provision of such statutes to the<br/>grievance processes of this Agreement. This provision is not intended to preclude the<br/>filing of a grievance and challenging the arbitrability of any section of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Severability and Savings</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any portion of this Agreement is found to be unlawful by a court of<br/>competent jurisdiction, the rest of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Legislature repeals or modifies sections of the Education Code relative to<br/>matters within the scope of representation, the District agrees to negotiate the effect<br/>of such modifications prior to implementing the provisions of any change. If the<br/>provisions of this paragraph are reopened, the provisions of Article XV, paragraph D,<br/>shall be suspended until an agreement is reached or the duty to bargain has been<br/>satisfied.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees that during the life of this Agreement it will not encourage,<br/>condone, participate in, or otherwise support any strike, work stoppage, slowdown,<br/>&quot;sick-in,&quot; or unlawful picketing, or fail or refuse to faithfully and fully perform assigned<br/>duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Exclusive Representative has the right to consult on the definition of educational<br/>objectives, the determination of the content of courses and curriculum, and the selection<br/>of textbooks to the extent such matters are within the discretion of the public school<br/>employer under the law. (Government Code, Section 3543.2(a)). The District shall give<br/>written notice to the Exclusive Representative that action on a matter subject to<br/>consultation is being considered.

<p>Appendix C<br/>Job Sharing Leaves of Absence</p>
<p>A. Permanent (tenured) classroom Unit Members who have satisfactory evaluations<br/>may apply to the Board of Trustees of the District no later than March 1 of the preceding<br/>school year for consideration of a job-sharing leave of absence under the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Unit Member of a team submitting a job-sharing leave request must meet<br/>all the credential and job description requirements for the requested position.</p>
<p>Further, the District must be able to employ a suitable replacement in the position<br/>being left vacant.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job-sharing leave request must include a work schedule that is educationally<br/>sound, as determined by the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job-sharing leave request must not cause the District to expend additional<br/>funds.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leave for a job-sharing assignment, as well as any request for renewal of a<br/>job-sharing assignment, is subject to annual approval by the Board of Trustees of<br/>the District. Request for renewal must be submitted no later than March 1.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District's health and welfare contribution shall be shared equally (or in a<br/>percentage that matches the work year of each Unit Member) by the job-sharing<br/>team. Any Unit Member contributions that are necessary to maintain coverage must<br/>be received by the District in a timely manner. If allowed by the insurance provider,<br/>and if there is no additional cost to the District, one of the two part-time Unit<br/>Members may decline coverage, thereby allowing the second Unit Member to have<br/>full coverage.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step advancement on the salary schedule shall occur every other year for each<br/>Unit Member who completes the equivalent of at least 75 percent of a full school<br/>year of service within any two-year period of job-sharing leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation of the Superintendent/Principal must accompany the initial<br/>and subsequent renewal of job-sharing leave requests to the Board of Trustees of<br/>the District.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may apply any reasonable limit on the number of job-sharing<br/>assignments it deems necessary.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that one Unit Member of the job-sharing team is unable to complete<br/>the work term as specified and approved in the job-sharing leave request, the<br/>remaining Unit Member shall immediately assume the full-time position for the<br/>remainder of the school year.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Unit Members of a job-sharing team will attend Open House and Back-to-<br/>School Night unless extenuating circumstances, as determined by the District,<br/>prevent the fulfillment of these responsibilities. Both Unit Members will attend</p>
<p>San Miguel CTA (2011-2013)</p>
<p>Page -33-</p>
<p>individual parent conferences at the request of either the Principal or the parents.<br/>Both Unit Members will attend necessary special staff meetings or conferences as<br/>determined by the Principal. Unit Members of the job-sharing team shall be<br/>responsible for attending all Unit Member staff development days. Unit Members of<br/>the job-sharing team will attend workdays other than for the purpose of staff<br/>development training in the ratio equivalent to the time included in the job-sharing<br/>agreement. The exact days of attendance, including Unit Member workdays and<br/>student-free staff development days, will be determined by the District after<br/>consultation with the Unit Members of the job-sharing team and appropriate<br/>supervisor. The assignment of workdays shall be made prior to the first Unit<br/>Member workday for the school year.</p>
<p>11 .Under extenuating circumstances, the District will consider job-sharing requests<br/>after the March 1 deadline referred to in this Appendix.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case when only one Unit Member requests job sharing, then a part-time,<br/>limited term, temporary Unit Member may, at the discretion of the District, be hired by<br/>the District to fulfill the rest of the job-sharing schedule. All provisions in Section A,<br/>above, shall be in effect except the following.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances, shall the temporary Unit Member work more than 50<br/>percent of the instructional school day or year, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be assumed that the normal schedule for the temporary Unit Member to<br/>work shall be no more than 50 percent of the school days. Although scheduling<br/>variations may include more days for part-time, under no circumstances of<br/>scheduling shall the temporary Unit Member gain probationary status while job<br/>sharing, even if more than 75 percent of the school work year days are worked on a<br/>part-time basis. No job rights toward future employment shall be granted due to a<br/>new Unit Member being hired to fulfill a job-share.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the permanent Unit Member returns to the full-time job, the temporary Unit<br/>Member shall be terminated.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary Unit Member shall be paid at the contracted salary rate<br/>appropriate to experience and training, but not to exceed the salary level of the<br/>permanent Unit Member (refer to A.3.).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the temporary Unit Member becomes unavailable to complete<br/>the assignment, the permanent Unit Member shall return to full-time status<br/>immediately.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of discretion within the terms of this Job-Sharing Appendix is not<br/>subject to the grievance procedures of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
