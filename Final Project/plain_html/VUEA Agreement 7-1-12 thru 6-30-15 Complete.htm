<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation to Assist California Teachers</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers for Children</p>
<p>Such payments shall be made on or before October 31<sup>st</sup> of each school year. The District will accept deduction<br/>authorizations for FACT or United Way.</p>
<p>2. Proof of payment and a written statement of objections along with verifiable evidence of membership in a religious body<br/>whose traditional tenets or teachings object to joining or financially supporting employee organizations, pursuant to<br/>paragraph D (1) above, shall be made on an annual basis to the Association as a condition of continued exemption from<br/>the provisions of paragraph A and B of the Article. Proof shall be in the form of receipts and/or canceled checks indicating<br/>the amount paid, date of payment, and to whom payment in lieu of the service fee has been made.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic payroll deduction of representational fees.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 above, whether for membership dues or<br/>representation fee, the District agrees promptly to remit such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of<br/>bargaining unit members for whom such deduction has been made, categorizing them as to membership or non-membership<br/>in the Association, and indicating any changes in personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>

CTA shall have the right to determine<br/>whether any such action or proceeding referred to above shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, tried, or appealed,<br/>provided however that the District may select its own attorney and shall have the right to be consulted before any of the<br/>foregoing decisions are made. Ventura Unified Education Association, CTA/NEA further agrees to indemnify the District and<br/>its officials and employees against any and all damage, judgments, and any settlements of such litigations, arising out of this<br/>Article 6; except, however that such indemnification shall not be applicable to litigation instituted by the Association against the<br/>District based on this article.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the above listed class size averages are subject to modification for purposes such as, but not limited to avoidance<br/>of split-grade or low enrollment classes, large group or experimental instruction, team teaching limitations because of<br/>distribution of pupils by attendance areas, changes in enrollment, or other valid reasons.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocate discretionary money ($250) for each 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade teacher</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of this allocation is to provide support for the classroom teachers as they meet the needs of a large, diverse<br/>group. Substitutes can be used to provide additional time to prepare parent conferencing, report cards, and/or completing<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers shall determine what works for them at their site. They may pool their dollars, spend them on an individual<br/>basis or a combination thereof.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher may appropriate funds to pay for substitutes, someone to cover supervision duties, hire someone to teach<br/>physical education, art, music, etc. or purchase supplies/materials.

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All extended year bargaining unit members must hold the appropriate credential for the teaching assignment for which they<br/>are selected. (Majors and minors are important at the secondary level.)</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority will be given to candidates who have taught within the system for at least one school year.</p>
<p>1. An exception to this would be a position requiring a highly specialized area of preparation for which only a first year<br/>teacher had made application.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All extended year bargaining unit members must have been recommended for continued employment in the District on their<br/>last regular evaluation form.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members are encouraged to develop and submit new offerings for the extended year session. If a suggested<br/>course becomes a part of the extended year program, that teacher will be given favorable consideration for the first summer<br/>the course is offered.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first offer of employment will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made to bargaining unit members who have applied but not taught extended year in the</p>
<p>previous two summers. The second &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offer of employment will be made to bargaining unit members who have applied but not</p>
<p>taught extended year the summer immediately preceding.</p>
<p>1. The above priority hiring procedure may be waived for good cause. The extended year site administrator will have the<br/>primary responsibility of informing the applicant by written statement of the reasons for not hiring.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members who apply&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for an extended year position shall be notified on or before the end of the regular school</p>
<p>year of District intent to employ or not employ. In cases where employment is contingent upon actual class enrollment on the<br/>opening day of extended year school, applicants will be so informed in their letters of notification.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All extended year contracts are contingent upon the class or classes filling.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday school classes funded by extended year funds will be offered to K-12 students in the District. Hiring practices for<br/>Saturdays will be the same as those used for staffing the extended year program. Remuneration for pass/fail credit classes<br/>will be at the district certificated hourly rate (refer to Article 17, Section B, Number 1). Any other credit class on Saturday will<br/>be paid at the extended year rate (see Article 17, Section D).</p>

<p>ARTICLE 11<br/>ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher Assignment</p>
<p>School site assignment is defined as the movement of a teacher from one grade to another at the same school site or from</p>
<p>one subject area to another prior to posting a position for an outside candidate.</p>
<p>1. School Site Assignment Procedure:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switching Assignment at a Site (prior to switching assignments, the principal shall inform school site staff members of</p>
<p>anticipated openings at the school site):</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District may switch unit member assignments for credentialing, class size balancing and other educational</p>
<p>reasons.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassigning a unit member shall not be made arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the unit member who is involuntarily reassigned shall be granted a meeting with the administrator<br/>who reassigned the unit member to discuss the reasons for the reassignment. The unit member may request<br/>and shall receive written reason for the assignment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member at the site shall have the same transfer opportunities as defined in Article 11.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall have the opportunity to interview a minimum of three (3) candidates for any opening. If less<br/>than three candidates on site apply, and the site principal decides to open the position to transfer candidates<br/>within the district, he/she shall inform the on-site bargaining unit member of this intent.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling Vacancies at a Site:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to posting an open position for transfer candidates from within VUSD, the principal shall inform school-site<br/>staff members via a faculty meeting or a notice in all Bargaining Unit Member mail boxes of anticipated<br/>openings(s) at the school. A minimum of three business days notice shall be given. Once school has started, if<br/>a teacher is displaced from an assignment and that assignment subsequently re-opens, the displaced teacher<br/>will have the first right of refusal for the re-opened assignment up to October 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Summer openings: In order to be considered for openings that occur during the summer, Bargaining Unit<br/>Members who are interested in a change of assignment on their current site must notify the site principal in<br/>writing of their request by June 30 of current school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering the overall needs/interests at the school, the preference expressed by individual teachers (as<br/>well as credential authorization), the principal must specifically identify the position before posting it within the<br/>district for transfer.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal communicates all teacher assignment decisions.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher (with or without VUEA representation) may request and receive the reason(s) for the decision.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination Class Assignment: The District shall assign combination classes using a fair and consistent process.</p>
<p>1. The district shall apply the following steps:</p>
<p>a. The district shall invite and use volunteers first.</p>
<p>1. In the case of more than one volunteer for the same combination class assignment, the teacher with the most<br/>district seniority will have first right of refusal.</p>
<p>Article 11</p>
<p>Page 1</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are insufficient volunteers, the District may assign a teacher. Upon request, the District shall provide the<br/>assigned teacher with written rationale for making the assignment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the District shall provide the assigned teacher with written rationale.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site principal should meet and confer with the combination class teacher to discuss the student selection for a<br/>combination class.</p>
<p>2. The district will apply the following factors in making the assignments:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When program needs require combination classes, the District will rotate combination class assignments among<br/>teachers at all grade levels at elementary schools of 350 students or less. At elementary schools with more than 350<br/>students, combination class assignments will rotate among teachers at the grade levels affected.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will avoid assigning teachers with less than one year of teaching experience to combination classes<br/>unless program needs require it, or the training or abilities qualify the teacher to perform the assignment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will not assign a teacher to consecutive years of to a combination class unless the program needs<br/>require it.</p>
<p>C. Transfer Procedures: A transfer may be requested by a permanent or probationary bargaining unit member, the principal of<br/>the bargaining unit member’s school, or may be initiated by the Superintendent or designee. The approval of the<br/>Superintendent or designee is required for any transfer implemented.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Principles</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main criterion for consideration of a request for transfer is whether or not the request will result in the best<br/>educational program for the school District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best educational program results from the selection of a school faculty that is well-balanced in terms of teacher<br/>experience, general background, and competence. Careful consideration will be given to these criteria when filling</p>
<p>vacancies.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering a request for transfer, the convenience and wishes of the individual bargaining unit member will be<br/>considered to the extent that they do not conflict with the general principles described above.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for Transfer Requested by Bargaining Unit Members</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members applying for transfer for the following school year shall file a request on the transfer request<br/>form (see Appendix E) with the Certificated Human Resources Office at any time. If a transfer is granted, notification<br/>of the new assignment will be made in writing. Teachers who are to be transferred will usually be notified by June<br/>20th.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member wishing to be considered for a transfer during the summer vacation period, must provide<br/>the Certificated Human Resources office with his/her summer address, personal email, and phone number (see<br/>Appendix E).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If bargaining unit members within the District have applied for the same position, the individual best qualified for that<br/>position shall be appointed. The transfer comparison form shall be used in order to compare district employees.<br/>(Appendix E).</p>
<p>This would include degree, experience, credits in subject area, credential authorization, methodology applicable to<br/>the position, and the ability to handle extra-curricular activities. Qualifications being substantially equal, seniority in<br/>the District shall control.</p>
<p>Article 11</p>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guided by the general principles and procedures set forth in Article 11, C-2, the Superintendent, or the<br/>superintendent’s designee, shall consider the following in determining which internal candidate is best qualified<br/>for a specific position.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degrees applicable to position;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary teaching experience at appropriate grade level/subject/program: K-3, 4-5, 6-8; outside<br/>experience limited to five years.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of course credits in the subject area or program;</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State certification appropriate to assignment;</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary experience in grades 6-12 specific subject areas, including CORE. Outside experience limited to<br/>five years.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other criteria as determined by the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A numerical score of [0] through [6] inclusive will be given to the applicants in each area listed above, except for<br/>number [6], &quot;other criteria.” “Other criteria” shall be scored from [0] to [8], A standardized form developed by the<br/>District and the Association will be used to rank each applicant (see Appendix E). If two or more candidates are<br/>equally qualified in each criteria, the same score will be given to each.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these criteria [1] through [6] are substantially equal, the preference in transfer shall be given to the<br/>bargaining unit member with seniority in the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member with seniority in a given situation is not granted a transfer, the bargaining unit<br/>members shall receive, upon request, the reasons for the decision. The explanation shall include the bargaining<br/>unit members transfer comparison results.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside candidates, may be considered or interviewed if less than three (3) qualified probationary or permanent<br/>bargaining unit members apply. In order to be hired, an outside candidate must be substantially superior to District</p>
<p>applicants.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not later than April 20 of each school year, the Certificated Human Resources office shall post a list of all vacancies<br/>and transfer opportunities reported by the principals on the district WEB site and at the Human Resources Office.<br/>Certificated Human Resources will also send a list of all vacancies and transfer opportunities to each school site and<br/>to the VUEA Office.

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bargaining Unit Member who has a transfer request on file in the Certificated Human Resources office shall be<br/>notified of vacancies for which he/she has requested a transfer and for which he/she is qualified.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than May 20<sup>th</sup> and the last day of each school year, the Certificated Human Resources office shall have<br/>posted on the district WEB site a supplemental list of vacancies which will occur during the following school year. A<br/>copy will be posted at the District Office and sent to each school site by the last day of the school year. All requests<br/>for transfer on file in the Certificated Human Resources department shall be considered up to October 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests for transfer on file in the Certificated Human Resources Department shall be destroyed after October 1<sup>st</sup>.<br/>All new transfer requests for the following year may be filed at any time. Nothing in the Article shall prevent a<br/>bargaining unit member from requesting a transfer at any time.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By June 30<sup>th</sup>, the Certificated Human Resources office shall make available to the Association a list of all transfers for<br/>the next school year. A supplemental list of transfers shall be made available to the Association by the end of August.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If district seniority is equal, the bargaining unit member with the least school site seniority shall be selected for<br/>transfer. Site seniority is determined by the bargaining unit member’s first work day at that site in a bargaining<br/>unit position.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If school site seniority is equal, the bargaining unit member with the most current date of initial hire shall be<br/>selected for transfer.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bargaining unit member is transferred involuntarily due to staff reduction or enrollment changes, the bargaining<br/>unit member shall be offered the first opportunity to return to his/her former school if a vacancy occurs in the<br/>subsequent school year. This is provided that the bargaining unit member is properly credentialed for said vacancy.<br/>The bargaining unit member is required to notify the Certificated Human Resources Department in writing of his/her<br/>desire to return to their previous school by May 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>

Displaced<br/>bargaining unit members shall receive priority placement for vacancies over bargaining unit members voluntarily<br/>seeking transfer. Displaced bargaining unit members shall indicate an order of preference for the available openings.<br/>If more than one displaced bargaining unit members seeks the same opening the following criteria shall be used to<br/>select the bargaining unit member that shall receive priority:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VUSD seniority as defined in 5.b.1 (above),</p>

The bargaining unit members with the most seniority shall have first choice at any<br/>position for which the teacher is properly qualified (qualifications to be determined by Article 11, Section<br/>C(2)(c)(1through 5), and the second best qualified the second choice, and the third best qualified the third choice,<br/>etc.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All displaced bargaining unit members shall be placed before any voluntary transfers or new applicants under Article<br/>11, Section D, as implemented.</p>

<p>A study leave may be granted for one year to enable an employee to pursue a minimum program for study of twelve (12)<br/>semester units, or eighteen quarter units, in a recognized institution of higher learning. Such courses shall be at the upper<br/>division or graduate level. Correspondence courses are not acceptable for leave purposes. If leaves are requested for<br/>less than one school year, a similar ratio between the stated unit requirements and time will be maintained.</p>

The following regulations will prevail in cases they cover:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave may be granted without loss of pay at the discretion of the Board and on recommendation by the Certificated<br/>Human Resources Department for attendance at distinctly professional meetings of educational groups at which the<br/>Superintendent and the Board feel the District should be represented.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other requests for necessary or voluntary leave for reasons not specified in these regulations will be considered by the<br/>Certificated Human Resources Department Administrator from the standpoint of value to the District, urgency of the<br/>request, and the employment record of the person making the request.</p>

<p>Every bargaining unit member employed by the Ventura Unified School District in a position requiring certification<br/>qualifications who enters the active military services of the United States of America or the State of California shall be entitled<br/>to absent himself/herself from his/her duties as an employee of the District.</p>
<p>Such absence shall not affect in any way the classification of such bargaining unit member. In the case of a probationary<br/>employee, the period of such absence shall not count as a part of the service required as a condition precedent to the<br/>classification of such a bargaining unit member as a permanent employee of the District, but such absence shall not be<br/>construed as a break in the continuity of the service of such bargaining unit member for any purpose.</p>
<p>Article 12</p>
<p>Page 5</p>
<p>Within six (6) months after such bargaining unit member honorably leaves such service or has been placed on inactive duty,<br/>he/she shall be entitled to return to the position held by him/her at the time of his/her entrance into such service at a salary to<br/>which he/she would have been entitled had he/she not absented himself/herself from the service of the District.</p>
<p>M. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT LEAVE</p>
<p>Education Code, Section 44984, permits a separate leave of absence due to injury or illness directly attributable to one’s<br/>employment. There is in effect by the above code section a sixty-day (60) industrial accident and illness leave.</p>
<p>The leave is non-accumulative.</p>
<p>Such leave shall commence on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>The bargaining unit member shall be paid in full during the period of the leave.</p>
<p>Such leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of authorized absence.</p>
<p>When such leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the bargaining unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused<br/>leave due him/her for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>When this leave is exhausted, the bargaining unit member shall be entitled to pull from his/her regular accumulated sick leave,<br/>and the District shall pay him/her an amount which will not exceed his/her full salary.</p>
<p>N. Emergency Leaves Due to Natural Disasters</p>

This leave shall be granted without loss of pay and shall not be charged against the<br/>bargaining unit member's sick leave.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Leave (Short Term)</p>

No<br/>leave granted under this section shall be less than one-half day. All leaves granted under this section shall be with full salary<br/>deduction.</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Leave (Long Term)</p>
<p>We agree that 100% assignments, in the majority of circumstances, are in the best interest of VUEA bargaining unit members,<br/>classroom students, and school sites. The intent of this language is to insure that priority in hiring and school staffing is given<br/>to 100% employees. A personal leave may be granted by the District for either one semester or one school year upon request<br/>of a bargaining unit member based on the individual program needs and circumstances of school sites. An extension of a<br/>year may be granted by the District upon request of a bargaining unit member. Such leaves are granted to bargaining unit<br/>members who are now permanent employees and shall be granted without pay. Time spent on such leave shall not count as<br/>time served in the District and no vertical movement on the salary schedule shall occur. Assignment of the bargaining unit<br/>member on return to the staff is at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>A long-term leave will not be granted for the purposes of obtaining or accepting employment outside of the Ventura Unified<br/>School District with any other employer.</p>

<p>Article 13</p>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>ARTICLE 14<br/>DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basis for Disciplinary Action</p>
<p>Discipline shall be taken only for just cause and shall follow the principles of progressive discipline.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just Cause</p>
<p>“Just Cause” shall include the causes set forth in the California Education Code.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive Discipline</p>
<p>The principles of “progressive discipline” shall require that an employee shall receive: counseling first, oral warnings next, and<br/>finally written warnings prior to being disciplined by suspension with loss of pay. The bargaining unit member may be<br/>represented by a Ventura Unified Education Association representative at any discipline meeting. The nature and/or severity<br/>of the circumstance may allow for steps of the progressive discipline process to be bypassed.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint(s): Letter in Personnel File</p>
<p>In the case of complaint(s) from parents, students, or others that may lead to a letter in a bargaining unit member’s personnel<br/>file, the following steps must occur:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A designated administrator shall evaluate the veracity and/or legitimacy of the complaints).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the administrator believes the complaint has merit, the bargaining unit member shall be informed of the nature of the<br/>complaint(s) and if possible, be allowed the opportunity to resolve the issue within 10 working days.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conference that includes the bargaining unit member, parents(s), and/or guardian(s) of the student, the student (if<br/>appropriate), the designated administrator, and/or other relevant parties should be held. The conference is optional if the<br/>bargaining unit member or the complaining party decides not to attend.</p>
<p>If the Certificated Human Resources Department Administrator decides that such a written complaint should be made a part of<br/>a bargaining unit member’s personnel file, the bargaining unit member must be notified of this decision and be given an<br/>opportunity to attach a written statement to the written complaint.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of Proposed Suspension</p>
<p>The supervisor shall advise the employee in writing of the proposed action. The written statement shall contain a description of<br/>the proposed action. The written statement shall contain a description of the events which necessitated the suspension, a<br/>statement of the charges, of all available materials leading to the suspension, and the right of the employee to meet with the<br/>supervisor or to submit in writing his/her response to the proposed action within a reasonable time frame. All information or<br/>proceedings regarding any such actual or proposed action shall be kept confidential by district management. No suspension<br/>directed under the authority of this article shall exceed five (5) work days without pay.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee's Response to Proposed Suspension</p>
<p>An employee may respond to the supervisor within five (5) days of receipt of the Notice of Proposed Suspension. The<br/>response may be in writing and/or the employee may meet with the supervisor. The purpose of the response is to allow the<br/>employee an opportunity to give information to the supervisor prior to the actual implementation of the suspension. An<br/>employee's opportunity to respond to the supervisor is not intended to be an adversarial hearing. The employee need not be<br/>accorded the opportunity to cross-examine witness, nor to present a formal case in opposition to the proposed suspension<br/>action. However, the limited nature of this response does not obviate the supervisor’s authority to initiate further investigation if<br/>the employee’s version of the facts raises doubts as to the accuracy of the supervisor’s information leading to the proposed<br/>discipline.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of suspension and Right to Grieve/Arbitrate</p>
<p>When an employee is given notice of a suspension, he/she shall be given concurrent notice of his/her right to grieve the action<br/>to the Certificated Human Resources Department level of the grievance procedure within ten (10) days of receiving the notice</p>
<p>Article 14</p>
<p>Page 1</p>
<p>of suspension. If the employee is not satisfied at the grievance level, he/she may take the case to binding arbitration. Also, the<br/>employee shall be given notice of his/her right to be represented by the Ventura Unified Education Association.</p>
<p>H. Follow-Up</p>
<p>If after 12 months following the incident which triggered the disciplining procedure the employee has not given cause for<br/>further disciplinary action, he/she shall be given a follow-up memo to the effect that there has not been any further violation.<br/>Said memo shall be attached to any original notice that may have been placed in his/her personnel file. At the end of four<br/>years after the incident, the information in the personnel file concerning the disciplinary action shall be sealed upon the written<br/>request of the employee.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 15<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>A certificated employee complaint shall be defined as a spoken or written dissatisfaction brought to the attention of his or<br/>her immediate supervisor. By mutual written agreement of the parties, similar grievances filed by individual bargaining unit<br/>members may be consolidated for processing through the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>A grievance is a written claim on the part of an employee or the Association that the contract has been violated,<br/>misinterpreted, or inequitably applied which was not settled to the satisfaction of the employee or the Association at the<br/>first supervisory level. A working day is defined as a day in which the District Office is open.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>No certificated employee shall suffer reprisals or reduction in status as a result of having presented a grievance or having<br/>represented an employee concerning a grievance.</p>
<p>Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and recommendations, and other necessary<br/>documents shall be prepared and given appropriate distribution by the Certificated Human Resources Department so as<br/>to facilitate operation of the procedures set forth herein.</p>
<p>Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the number of days indicated at each level<br/>should be considered as a maximum and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits specified<br/>may, however, be extended by written mutual agreement.</p>
<p>A decision rendered at any step in these procedures becomes final unless appealed within the time limit specified or at a<br/>time agreed to by both parties. If a decision is not given within the time limit, an appeal may be taken directly to the next</p>
<p>level.</p>
<p>Any certificated employee of the District required to be absent from duties pursuant to these procedures shall not suffer<br/>any loss of pay. Grievance procedure meetings normally will be scheduled during non-teaching time.</p>
<p>The grievant and the respondent shall have equal access to any pertinent District records, within the laws defining<br/>confidentiality.</p>
<p>All School District records, pertinent to processing of the grievance shall be filed in the Certificated Human Resources<br/>Department and shall be kept separate from the personnel files of the participating parties. At the conclusion of the case,<br/>all information pertaining to the case shall be sealed, and access to the information shall be authorized by the<br/>administrator in charge of personnel.</p>
<p>A brief statement of the decision made concerning the grievance shall be forwarded to the president of the Association by<br/>the Certificated Human Resources Department upon the conclusion of the action.</p>
<p>Article 15</p>
<p>Page 1</p>
<p>C. Representation</p>
<p>An employee has the right to represent himself/herself or be represented by another employee or employees of his/her<br/>own choosing, not to exceed three, and/or a representative of the Association. All meetings afforded to the employee<br/>shall be deemed to include his authorized representative, and information provided to the employee shall be provided to<br/>his/her representative.</p>
<p>A grievance may be adjusted at any level prior to arbitration without the intervention of the exclusive representative, if the<br/>adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of the agreement then in effect; and provided that the employer shall not<br/>agree to a resolution of the grievance until the exclusive representative has received a copy of the grievance and the<br/>proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>Any bargaining unit member of the District may serve as a representative without prejudice or loss of salary.</p>
<p>D. Procedure for Submission of Grievance</p>
<p>(For use herein the term “grievant” may refer to a bargaining unit member or the Association.) The time limits specified</p>
<p>may, however, be extended by written mutual agreement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within eight (8) working days after the alleged violation, a bargaining unit member, or the Association, considering a<br/>grievance will discuss the complaint with the appropriate principal or immediate supervisor with the objective of<br/>resolving the matter informally.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bargaining unit member or the Association wishes to proceed with the grievance, the bargaining unit member or<br/>the Association shall commit the grievance to writing and shall submit the written grievance to the supervisor within<br/>twenty (20) working days from the time the action which forms the basis of the grievance took place.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the written statement varies from the oral statement, the principal or immediate supervisor may require another<br/>conference with the grievant within five (5) working days. Additionally, the bargaining unit member and the<br/>administrator may agree to another conference to attempt resolution of the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written response shall be delivered to grievant and/or VUEA within eight (8) working days after receipt of written<br/>grievance or from the day of the conference about a written grievance.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance is not resolved after discussing it with his/her immediate supervisor, the grievant may appeal the<br/>decision to the Certificated Human Resources Department Administrator or his/her designee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where the first level of grievance is to the Certificated Human Resources Department Administrator and<br/>the grievant is dissatisfied with the decision of the Certificated Human Resources Department Administrator, he/she<br/>may appeal the decision to the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>Article 15</p>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions for Appeal</p>
<p>The following provisions shall apply to each step of appeal:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party to the grievance may request a review of the decision rendered at the previous step.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request must be made within five (5) working days after receipt of the previous decision.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request must be in writing and shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the bargaining unit member/Association submitting the grievance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the bargaining unit member’s /Association’s representative, if any.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the problem stating specifically the act or condition and ground on which the grievance is</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persons who have been contacted or involved.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course of action that has been followed, including the decision rendered at the complaint level and why<br/>the decision is being appealed.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator to whom the appeal is being made shall hold a conference concerning the grievance with the grievant<br/>and with his/her representative, if he/she has one. The conference shall be held within eight (8) working days after<br/>receiving the grievance.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each person to whom an appeal is made shall receive the decisions rendered at a lower administrative level, and may<br/>request such additional information from any of the parties as will enable him/her to establish specifically the issues that<br/>remain in dispute.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator to whom an appeal is being made shall communicate his/her decision in writing, together with<br/>supporting reasons to the parties in interest within eight (8) working days after the conference is held with the grievant.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conciliation</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision of the previous level or if there is no decision within the time limits, the parties<br/>may, by mutual agreement, request conciliation within ten (10) days from receipt of the previous level decision or from the<br/>expiration of the time limits for management's decision.</p>
<p>If the parties request conciliation, they will set a meeting with the Conciliator from the California State Conciliation Service as<br/>soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>If not satisfied with the decision at the previous level, the grievant as an alternate to appealing to the Board of Education may,<br/>within five (5) days, submit a request in writing to the Association for binding arbitration of the dispute. The Association, by<br/>written notice to the Certificated Human Resources Department Administrator, may submit the grievance to binding arbitration,<br/>within ten (10) working days of receipt from grievant. In addition to notifying the Certificated Human Resources Department<br/>Administrator of their intent to move the grievance to arbitration, the Association will within the same ten (10) day period<br/>request a list of names of potential arbitrators from the State Conciliation Services Office. Upon receipt of the list the parties<br/>will meet within five (5) working days to select the arbitrator. If the timelines are not complied with, the grievance shall be<br/>deemed dropped. Disputes as to whether a grievance is related to a violation of the contract shall be determined by an<br/>arbitrator. The Association and the District may mutually agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement can be reached, the<br/>Association shall request the State Conciliation Services Office to supply a panel of five (5) names of persons experienced in<br/>hearing grievances in public schools. Each party shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The remaining<br/>panel member shall be the arbitrator. The grievant shall strike the first name.</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other<br/>expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the issue or issues submitted to him/her.</p>
<p>If the parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written<br/>grievance and the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>Article 15</p>
<p>Page 3</p>
<p>The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this Agreement or the written policies, rules,<br/>regulations and procedures of the District.</p>
<p>After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing<br/>to all parties his/her finding and recommendations which shall be binding to the parties.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 17 - (continued)</p>
<p>CERTIFICATED SALARY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>A. Initial Placement on the Salary Schedule</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Placement</p>
<p>One step on the salary schedule will be granted for each year of prior teaching experience<br/>upon employment, up to and including five years. A year is defined as at least 75 percent of<br/>the number of days the regular schools of the district are in session.</p>
<p>Credit for years of experience for initial placement on the salary scale shall only be given for<br/>experience at the K-12 levels.</p>
<p>If a certificated employee moves from a position within the District not covered by this<br/>Agreement, five years is the maximum years of experience an employee may be granted for<br/>initial placement on the salary scale.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2008, initial placement of a Speech/Language Pathologist with a credential or<br/>a license will be step 7 of the Certificated Salary Scale. Service experience credit for a<br/>Speech and Language Pathologist may include previous clinical experience.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification Placement</p>
<p>Classification is determined by the number of acceptable college units that have been earned<br/>subsequent to the bachelor's degree.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units must be earned in Education or in subjects commonly taught in public schools.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units must be rated upper division or graduate by the institution granting the unit.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of college work is required by the Certificated Human Resources Department in the<br/>form of transcripts, grade cards, etc.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment of Experience and Units</p>
<p>Judgment of experience and units for initial placement on the salary schedule shall be made<br/>by the Certificated Human Resources Department Administrator. A certificated employee<br/>covered by this Agreement may appeal his or her initial placement on the salary scale. The<br/>employee must submit a written appeal to the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources<br/>within thirty days of the receipt of employee’s first pay check with the District. If a bargaining<br/>unit member feels there has been a misjudgment and is unable to resolve this difference, the<br/>following course of action is available:</p>
<p>a. Request for help should be made through the Association.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Pay Plan</p>
<p>Members of the certificated staff of the Ventura Unified School District shall be given the<br/>option to receive their warrants in eleven (11), or twelve (12) equal payments. The option is to<br/>be made before August 22 and shall remain unchanged for one year.</p>
<p>Article 17</p>

<p>sufficient acceptable semester units have been earned to qualify for such advancement.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who qualify for placement on a new column each fall must have completed their<br/>additional units and have a verification of unit work completed on file with the Certificated<br/>Human Resources Department by October 1<sup>st</sup>. If the bargaining unit member is unable to<br/>obtain transcripts by that date, a letter from the instructor of the class certifying that the<br/>bargaining unit member was enrolled and has completed the course or courses, giving the<br/>number of units, and the title of the course, will suffice to allow a tentative placement.<br/>Final verification of completion of the work must be filed by November 1<sup>st</sup>, and should be<br/>in the form of an official transcript or grade report. Failure to file this official verification will<br/>automatically result in reclassification to the column and step that had been officially<br/>verified.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units must be earned through an accredited institution as recognized by the United States<br/>Department of Education Office of Educational Research and Improvement and/or the<br/>California State Department of Education and must be in education or subjects taught in<br/>public schools.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VUEA total bargaining unit cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reduction percentage will be no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greater than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group,</p>
<p>excluding VCEA.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All funds generated by the work year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rollback of VUEA bargaining unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be applied&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directly to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saving</p>

The District shall also maintain current written settlement<br/>agreements between the parties to this agreement.</p>
<p>If during the life of this Agreement the State legislature takes actions to change the present Education Code sections related<br/>to teacher layoffs and places the responsibility for layoff procedures into the hands of the local board of education, then layoff<br/>procedures will be negotiated at that time.</p>
<p>Article 20</p>
<p>Page 1</p>

<p>The staff should share decision-making at the site level in a collegial manner, while recognizing that the decisions must<br/>conform to State and Federal laws, District policy, and the VUEA/VUSD Contract unless a waiver of the VUEA/VUSD Contract<br/>has been granted.</p>
<p>Contract Waiver Requests</p>
<p>Waiver proposals must conform to the VUEAA/USD Contract unless a waiver is granted in accordance with the procedures<br/>outlined in this Article. Waivers of State and Federal laws are not permitted.</p>
<p>Proposals shall not contain any provisions contrary to, or in conflict with the VUEAA/USD Contract, unless specific waivers are<br/>agreed to by both VUEA and VUSD on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The following Articles in the VUEAA/USD Contract shall not be eligible for a waiver: Recognition, Evaluation, the Salary<br/>Schedule and Benefits, Assignment and Transfer, Association Rights, Professional Dues &amp; Payroll Deduction, Grievances,<br/>Discipline, and Non-Discrimination.</p>
<p>Contract waivers, upon ratification by VUEA and VUSD, shall be written and fully incorporated into the VUEAA/USD Contract<br/>by use of Memorandums of Understanding (MOU). The MOU(s) shall contain the specific site subject to the waiver, the<br/>effective date and the duration of the waiver(s).</p>
<p>Scope of Decisions</p>
<p>The following list includes only a few possible issues that could be resolved through site-based decision-making. Each site<br/>would need to examine its own unique issues and opportunities for involvement.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allocation of resources and total facility within district policies</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student discipline policies/attendance policies within the frameworks of Board Policies</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration of curriculum within context of State frameworks and District accountability standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning strategies for special needs students using the Federal, State, and District guidelines</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring school day, number and time of classes, planning time within District standards, and the<br/>VUEAA/USD Contract</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goals and objectives for school within the standards set by the District</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment of students, scheduling of classes within collective bargaining agreement and standards set by the<br/>District</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of standing and/or ad hoc committees as needed</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development, selection, and implementation of programs.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing and conducting staff development programs.</p>
<p>Procedure for Site Based Decision Making:</p>
<p>A school site must follow steps #1-6 in order to implement school site change(s) that affect the VUEAA/USD Contract.</p>
<p>1) Proposal Development at School Site</p>
<p>Article 27</p>

<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract Waiver Approval By VUEA And VUSD</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposal Development at School Site</p>
<p>Bargaining unit member(s) at a school site may initially develop proposals seeking to improve the learning environment by<br/>allowing for organizational change and educational reform.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Site Voting on Proposal.</p>
<p>The proposed plan shall be fully presented and explained at a regularly scheduled staff meeting.</p>
<p>If one third or more of the school site bargaining unit members (full-time, part-time, or itinerant), voting by secret ballot,<br/>vote affirmatively on the proposal, the proposal goes to the School Site Council for consideration. VUEA Site<br/>Representatives shall oversee the process. Absentee ballots may be allowed.</p>
<p>The initial vote must be held before November 1st. Successful proposals must be submitted to the School Site Council<br/>before December 1st. Proposals submitted after this time may be approved for implementation in the subsequent school<br/>year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Site Council Approval</p>
<p>The proposal shall proceed to the existing School Site Council for approval or disapproval.</p>
<p>If approved, the proposal shall proceed to the District Steering Council.</p>
<p>If SSC meetings are held during the regular school day, release time shall be provided for bargaining unit members to<br/>serve on this council.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Steering Council Approval</p>
<p>The District Steering Council shall be comprised of four management employees selected by the district and four<br/>bargaining unit members selected by VUEA. One person appointed by VUEA and one by VUSD shall jointly chair the<br/>District Steering Council. The co-chairs, prior to each meeting, shall mutually prepare the agenda.</p>
<p>The duties and functions of this council are:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To review the proposed plan for alignment with the VUEA/VUSD Contract, board policy, Education Code,</p>
<p>Federal Law, and/or other laws and regulations.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acts as an appeals board in cases of disagreement at the SSC level.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the deadline for the final school site vote.</p>
<p>If DSC meetings are held during the regular school day, release time shall be provided for bargaining unit members to<br/>serve on this council.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final School Site Approval Voting (2/3 majority required)</p>
<p>A final site election shall be held if the DSC approves the proposal.</p>
<p>Prior to the final election the proposed plan shall be presented in writing and fully explained at a regularly scheduled staff<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>Article 27</p>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the site bargaining unit members must vote affirmatively to approve the proposal.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 2/3 majority must be comprised by a 2/3 &quot;positive” vote of the eligible staff members. The effect of a non¬<br/>voting staff member would be the same as a “no” vote. VUEA may, at its discretion, if the situation warrants,<br/>allow for abstentions not to be factored in the results, (i.e. bargaining unit member is out of country and cannot<br/>be reached).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote shall be conducted by secret ballot.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absentee ballots may be allowed.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All aspects of the elections shall be conducted and overseen by VUEA.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 28<br/>RIGHTS OF PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES</p>
<p>If a second year probationary teacher is notified of his/her non-reelection, he/she may request, in writing, the reason for such<br/>non-reelection. The second year probationary teacher may appeal his/her non-reelection by requesting a hearing from the<br/>Board on a form that includes a statement that the Board’s decision is final and binding. An Association representative may<br/>accompany the probationary teacher to the meeting with the Board. The Board will not place in the personnel file the<br/>statement of reasons, the request for hearing, and the findings of the hearing.</p>
<p>In no case will a probationary teacher be non-reelected if the evaluation procedures have not been followed. The evaluation<br/>procedures shall not be invalid based upon non-substantive procedural errors committed by the School District or Board of<br/>Education unless the errors are prejudicial errors.</p>
<p>Article 28</p>

<p>ARTICLE 29</p>
<p>RETIREMENT PROGRAMS</p>
<p>A. Mid-Year Retirement Option One</p>

<p>1. Eligibility</p>
<p>To be eligible for the Mid-Year Retirement Option One, a bargaining unit member must</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be 55 years old or older and be STRS eligible for retirement benefits.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have submitted a request to retire to the Ventura Unified School District Human Resource office no later<br/>than the last day before winter break for the retirement to begin on the day after the last day of the first<br/>semester. The bargaining unit member’s last day of work will be the last day of the first semester.</p>
<p>2. Bonus and Benefits</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eligible retiree will be entitled to a paid bonus on or before July 31<sup>st</sup> of the school year following the date<br/>of retirement. The paid bonus will be the difference between what the bargaining unit member would have<br/>earned had he/she worked for the remainder of the current school year in which the bargaining unit member<br/>retired and the amount they would earn at Class 5, Step 8.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VUSD will deduct appropriate taxes and any other required withholdings from the lump sum payment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District paid health insurance will be discontinued for early retirees effective the last day of the month in<br/>which the bargaining unit member worked prior to retirement.</p>
<p>B. Mid-Year Retirement Option Two (Retired Annuitant)</p>
<p>Subject to approval of the Ventura County Office of Education and to the extent permitted by State and Federal law, the Mid-</p>
<p>Year Retirement Option Two will be implemented for the 2012-2013 school year only.</p>
<p>1. A bargaining unit member who retires under Mid-Year Retirement Option Two may request to return to his/her<br/>teaching assignment on the first day of the second semester as an early retired annuitant subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>To be eligible for the District's Retirement Option Two, a bargaining unit member must</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be 60 years old or older and be STRS eligible for retirement benefits.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have submitted a request to retire to the Ventura Unified School District Human Resource office no later than the<br/>last day before winter break for the retirement to begin on the day after the last day of the first semester. The<br/>bargaining unit member's last day of work will be the last day of the first semester.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member must submit his/her request to continue to teach as an early retired annuitant no<br/>later than the last day before winter break. The request must be approved by the superintendent or his/her<br/>designee. Such request shall be included in the notice of retirement referred to in Section 1b, above. If the<br/>request is denied, the bargaining unit member has the option of rescinding his/her retirement notice.</p>
<p>Article 29</p>
<p>Page 1</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early retired annuitant would be classified as a &quot;temporary employee” and maintain temporary status and<br/>teach only for the remainder of the current school year following his/her mid-year retirement. The eligible retiree<br/>would not be required to attend and would not be compensated for working on the spring buy-back day or the<br/>high school post service day.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will continue to provide District paid health insurance to the early retired annuitant at his/her pre¬<br/>retirement level through August 31<sup>st</sup> provided the early retired annuitant continues to meet the District’s eligibility<br/>requirements as stated in Article 18.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early retired annuitant's compensation during the remainder of the current school year shall be determined by<br/>multiplying the number of school days the early retired annuitant works by the daily pay rate at Class 5, Step 8 up<br/>to the maximum amount allowed by STRS (currently $31,020.) Monthly timesheets must be submitted by the<br/>early retired annuitant and adjustments for workday absences will be made on a month to month basis.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid-Year Retirement Bonus: An eligible retiree will be entitled to a paid bonus in a lump sum on or before July<br/>31<sup>st</sup> of the school year following the date of retirement. The paid bonus will be the difference between Class 5<br/>Step 8, after adjustments for work-day absences have been made, and what the bargaining unit member would<br/>have earned had he/she worked as a regular employee during the remainder of the current school year in which<br/>the bargaining unit member retired. Appropriate taxes and other appropriate withholdings will be deducted from<br/>any payment.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early retired annuitant shall remain a bargaining unit member and be classified as a temporary employee.<br/>He/she shall continue to be covered by the VUEA/VUSD collective bargaining agreement except for the following<br/>articles (unless required by federal/state law):</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11 - Assignment and Transfer</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 12 - Leaves of Absence</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 37 - Catastrophic Sick Leave</p>
<p>Bonus Distribution Options</p>
<p>1. Mid-Year Retirement Bonus can be utilized for District's Health Insurance Program: An eligible retiree (option two<br/>only) may opt to utilize his/her bonus along with his/her deferred compensation in order to buy into the District’s Health<br/>insurance Program at the District rate.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eligible employee will allocate his/her bonus over a one year period towards the cost of Health<br/>insurance benefits. The employees will utilize his/her deferred compensation (buyout balance) to pay the<br/>difference in the cost of health insurance for a one year period. The employee will receive health insurance<br/>for a one year period at the District rate.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee does not have enough in his/her buy-out balance to cover the health insurance cost, the<br/>employee may buy into the program by paying the District's one year health insurance cost, minus his/her<br/>bonus and buyout balance prior to retirement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any residual employee deferred compensation funds will be paid to the employee by January 15, 2015</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the 2014 open enrollment period a retiree may opt to withdraw from the health insurance<br/>plan. Any residual funds will be returned to the employee. In the event of the retiree’s death, health<br/>insurance coverage will cease at the end of that month and any residual funds will be returned to the<br/>retiree's beneficiaries.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This portion of the Early Retired Annuitant Incentive Option plan requires the acceptance of the Gold Coast<br/>Trust.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 30</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL COURTESY / PERB SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT</p>
<p>This agreement was made between Ventura Unified School District (“District”) and the Ventura Unified Education Association<br/>in settlement of PERB Case No. LA-CE-3695 and No. LA-CE 3696 (collective referred to as “Unions) on January 10,1997.</p>
<p>The following is agreed to:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member of either Union shall be allowed to establish residence for purposes of determining<br/>where the child of such member shall attend school in any regular education program, by (a) the actual residence of<br/>the member or the child if the child does not reside with the member, or (b) the site where the employee is assigned<br/>to work within the District, at the employee's option.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, any bargaining unit members are granted other options (note asterisks) to alleviate transportation,<br/>childcare and/or school preference concerns of the employees. For purposes of this agreement, “regular education<br/>program” is defined as any program where enrollment is based on residence. “Regular education program” does not<br/>include special education programs made available under the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (20 U.S.C.<br/>section 1401) et seq. and Education Code section 56000 et seq.</p>

<p>Mainstreaming: Special Day Class students who are integrated but who participate in general programs for at least some<br/>portion of the day in what are typically core academic classes which may include but are not limited to reading,<br/>mathematics, social studies, etc. Participation is based upon the prerequisite of specific strengths or skills in the content<br/>area.</p>
<p>A mainstreamed student or a student taking part in integration activities is not considered to be a “fully included” student.<br/>Full Inclusion:</p>
<p>Special Day Class students who are placed full-time into a regular education classroom for whom curricular, and/or behavioral<br/>modifications are needed.</p>
<p>Full inclusion is that special education option determined by an IEP team that places a severely handicapped student in<br/>an age appropriate regular education classroom on a full-time basis. The included student is handicapped to such a<br/>degree that significant curricular modifications are required which necessitate the collaboration of regular and special<br/>education teachers. Special Education services which these students require will still be provided, i.e. hearing aids, Braille<br/>machine, etc. There is no prerequisite for the student to be included in the regular classroom and the student is not<br/>expected to meet the same curricular and/or behavioral standards. Behavioral intervention documents may be utilized to<br/>assist the inclusion process.</p>
<p>The above does not include students who are deaf/hard of hearing, orthopedically impaired, visually impaired, or other<br/>health impaired as their sole handicapping condition.</p>
<p>A. Full Inclusion Planning Team</p>
<p>A Full Inclusion Planning Team consisting of the principal, school psychologist, resource specialist or Special Day Class<br/>teacher, other support staff, and the general education teacher(s) with identified full inclusion pupils shall be organized at<br/>each site with identified full inclusion pupils.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full Inclusion Funds</p>
<p>Each full inclusion site shall receive an additional allocation of at least $1000 per site to support planning and<br/>implementation of the full inclusion program. The funding for this program will be negotiated annually. The Full Inclusion<br/>Planning Team shall determine the utilization of these funds to support full inclusion at their site.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release Time</p>
<p>1. Release time shall be allocated to unit members who are teachers of identified full inclusion pupils to provide<br/>planning time with the Resource Specialist or Special Day teacher, and other support personnel. This shall be funded<br/>by “B” above.</p>
<p>Article 31</p>
<p>Page 1</p>
<p>2. Unit members impacted by full inclusion will be provided with specialized training necessary for successful<br/>implementation. Such training shall be at the unit member’s request and funded by letter “B” above.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Reduction In Staff</p>
<p>The implementation of a Full Inclusion Program shall not be utilized as a tool for a reduction in staff.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size</p>
<p>The determination of the size of classes with fully included pupils shall take into consideration any extraordinary demands<br/>on physical space, unit member contact, and/or unit member supervision. The teacher has the right to appeal the decision<br/>of the Full Inclusion planning team. The teacher has a right to have an Association representative present. The class size<br/>for this program shall be negotiated annually.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior Notification</p>
<p>A unit member who will be impacted by full inclusion should receive prior notification. Placement shall occur only after the<br/>completion of the IEP process including administrative transfers for students coming from other districts.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T EACHER T RANSFER RIGHTS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before implementing the transfer policy below, the site administrator will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek a volunteer, at the grade level of the full inclusion student, to have the student assigned to his/her class.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is not a volunteer at the full inclusion student’s grade level, the site administrator will seek a volunteer<br/>from within the school site to change classes with the teacher that the student has been assigned.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer Policy</p>
<p>If there is not a volunteer to change classes with the teacher who has been assigned a full inclusion student, the</p>
<p>teacher may request a transfer to another site under the following conditions:</p>
<p>The district shall not deny to any unit member assigned to a full inclusion class the right to transfer to a vacant</p>
<p>position for which the unit member has an appropriate credential using the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When notified that the unit member is being assigned a full inclusion student, the unit member may request from<br/>the Certificated Personnel Office a list of any openings that presently are available for transfer. If there is an<br/>opening, the unit member, working through the Certificated Personnel Office, will be transferred to the opening. If<br/>two teachers are requesting a full inclusion transfer for a single open position, the one with the most seniority will<br/>get the transfer.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full inclusion transfer is for only the remainder of that school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the school year the position the unit member transfers into will open for transfer consideration by all<br/>other unit members who may wish to apply for transfer. At that point, the regular transfer process will become<br/>operative.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member who transfers so that he/she will not have a full inclusion student must then reapply for a<br/>transfer. The unit member may apply for the opening that was created in letter &quot;C” above; however, the regular<br/>transfer process will be used to see if the unit member may remain in the position.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 36</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONAL PLANNING AND PREPARATION TIME (BANKING TIMEf</p>
<p>Banking time is a modified school schedule that is created by lengthening the student day on four days per week, and thereby<br/>being able to shorten the student day on one day per week. This allows for the teacher preparation time that has been<br/>reduced on four days to be banked for use by teachers for instructional planning and preparation purposes on the fifth day.</p>
<p>School faculties in grade K through 8 may choose to bank time within the guidelines of this article.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this article, instructional planning and preparation time is teacher determined and may consist of</p>
<p>instructional planning, preparation of instructional materials, or other individual teacher determined<br/>professional activities.</p>
<p>The District is prohibited from conducting meetings involving teachers during banked time or in any other<br/>way using banked time. Banked time is for teachers individually and collectively to plan, develop, and<br/>prepare the instructional program, as specified above.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that want to restructure the school day by banking time must do the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site teaching staff in conjunction with the principal shall develop a plan for banking time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan can only be implemented if all three of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Site Council approval</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members’ approval (60% affirmative vote)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VUSD approval</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A VUEA Representative will conduct the voting by the bargaining unit members. All aspects of<br/>these elections shall be conducted and overseen by VUEA</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voting must be done by secret (written) ballot.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bargaining unit member vote meets the 60% affirmative requirement, the VUEA<br/>Representative will forward the results to the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources<br/>and VUEA.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final draft of the approved plan will be sent to the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources and VUEA by March 10<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time will continue in subsequent years. If a bargaining unit member wishes to discontinue banking</p>
<p>time, an election must be held as provided in section (3) above. A majority vote of greater than 50% is<br/>required to cease banking time.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time schedule which is implemented by this process requires the annual approval of VUEA</p>
<p>and VUSD.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 37<br/>CATASTROPHIC SICK LEAVE</p>
<p>Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank Creation and Administration:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to create a Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank effective September 1, 2005.<br/>The Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank shall be funded in accordance with the terms of section B below.</p>
<p>a. The intent of the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank is to provide additional coverage for bargaining unit<br/>members who have suffered a catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank shall accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank without regard to the daily rate of pay of<br/>the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank participant.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank shall be administered by a three (3) member Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank<br/>Committee appointed by the president of the Association. This committee shall have the responsibility of<br/>maintaining the records of the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank, receiving draw requests, verifying the validity of<br/>requests, approving or denying the requests, and communicating its decisions to the participants and the<br/>District Certificated Human Resources and/or Payroll departments.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee's authority shall be limited to administration and the committee shall approve all properly<br/>submitted requests complying with the terms of this article. Draws may not be denied on the basis of the type<br/>of illness or disability.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the unit member's available fully paid leave time has been exhausted (i.e., regular sick leave, off,<br/>etc.), the unit member will be placed on excess sick leave, i.e. five (5) school months at 50% pay.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the unit member has been in an excess sick leave (50% pay) status for twenty (20) consecutive working<br/>days, the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank Committee may add to the 50% pay to guarantee the unit member full<br/>pay provided the unit member has exhausted all other available paid leave for which he/she is eligible. Such<br/>addition shall begin no sooner than the 21st consecutive work day of excess sick leave and will continue for no<br/>more than forty (40) fully paid days or eighty (80) days at half-pay. Grants from the Catastrophic Sick Leave<br/>Bank may extend beyond the period covered by excess sick leave.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A draw from the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualifies the<br/>participant for Worker's Compensation benefits.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A draw from the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank may not be used for absence related to pregnancy.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draws for the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank pursuant to Section A.6 and A.7 listed above and shall be<br/>approved only for unit members who are active participants of the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank and who<br/>submit an official request for draw to the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank Committee.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a unit member has been granted a draw from the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank, they will not be eligible<br/>for another draw from the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank until one (1) year has elapsed since the end of the<br/>previous draw. A unit member may receive a maximum draw of forty (40) days at full pay or eighty (80) days<br/>at half-pay in any one year.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By December 5 of each school year, the Business Services shall notify the committee of the following:</p>
<p>a. The total number of days accumulated in the Bank on June 30 of the previous school year.</p>
<p>Article 37</p>
<p>Page 1</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days contributed by unit members for the current year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of participating unit members.</p>
<p>13. If the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the Catastrophic Sick<br/>Leave Bank shall be forfeited to the District (E.C. 44043.5)</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank - Eligibility and Contributions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Certificated employees (including Certificated management) who are probationary or permanent and who<br/>are on active duty with the district are eligible to contribute to and draw on the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank.<br/>New employees must complete and properly file a participation form within thirty (30) calendar days of<br/>achieving probationary or permanent status in order to be eligible for participation for the remainder of the<br/>eligibility year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires contribution to the Bank. Only contributors will be permitted to draw<br/>from the Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may elect to join or cancel participation in the Bank once each year. They must sign up by<br/>September 30 of each year they are going to participate in the Bank. The eligibility year for purposes of this<br/>article begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. Once the unit member has completed the necessary<br/>enrollment form, he/she shall remain a member of the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank until such time as he/she<br/>completes the necessary form to cancel participation in the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of contribution by each participating unit member for each school year shall be one regular day<br/>of sick leave, which shall be deemed to equate to the legal minimum required by Education Code 44043.5<br/>Section C.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional days of contribution will be required of participants if the number of days in the Bank falls<br/>below 50. Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank participants who are drawing from the Bank at the time of<br/>assessment will not be required to contribute to remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a<br/>Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank participant has no remaining sick leave at the time of the assessment,<br/>they need not contribute the additional days to remain a participant in the Catastrophic Sick Leave<br/>Bank</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days in the Bank at the beginning of a school year exceeds 1,000, no contribution<br/>shall be required of returning unit members. Those unit members joining the Catastrophic Sick Leave<br/>Bank for the first time and those returning from leave shall be required to contribute days to the bank.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional days above the first and second draw are required, both the Association and the District<br/>agree to come back and negotiate this item. At any time either the Association or the District can<br/>reopen this section of the contract. If this section of the contract is reopened during regular<br/>negotiations, it shall not be counted as a reopener if there are a limited number of articles that can be<br/>reopened.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank - Withdraw from the Bank:</p>
<p>1. Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank participants may draw from the Bank for any reason that qualifies them for the<br/>use of sick leave as per this article. If a participant is incapacitated, the application may be submitted to the<br/>committee by an agent or member of the participant's family. Participants initially applying to draw from the<br/>Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank will be required to submit a doctor's statement indicating the nature of the illness</p>
<p>Article 37</p>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>or injury and the probable length of absence from work. Members of the committee shall keep information<br/>regarding the nature of the illness confidential.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A participant's draw from the Bank may not exceed the statutory maximum period of twelve consecutive<br/>months.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must use all sick leave time (but not differential leave) available to them before applying for leave<br/>from the Bank.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the committee may reasonably presume that the applicant for a draw may be eligible for a Disability<br/>Award or a retirement under PERS or STRS or, if applicable, Social Security, the committee may request that<br/>the draw applicant apply for disability or retirement. Failure of the draw applicant to submit a complete<br/>application, including medical information provided by the applicant's physician, within twenty (20) calendar<br/>days will disqualify for further Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank payments. Any requests for additional medical<br/>information from PERS or STRS or Social Security shall be submitted within ten (10) working days or the<br/>participant's entitlement to Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank payments will cease. If denied benefits by PERS or<br/>STRS or Social Security, the applicant must appeal or entitlement to the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank shall<br/>cease.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of this article is the sole responsibility of the Association and the District shall not have any<br/>grievance filed against it with regards to this article,</p>
<p>Article 37</p>
<p>Page 3</p>

<p>CHECKLIST FOR THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS</p>
<p>Permanent Teachers may choose to do &quot;Peer Review” as an alternative to Principal-Teacher performance evaluation. With the Principal's<br/>endorsement, Permanent Teachers can work together to review Teacher performance and support each other in pursuing professional growth<br/>activities. The purpose of Peer Review is to give experienced teachers more responsibility for increasing their skills and an opportunity to design an<br/>individual process that will be most helpful to them.</p>
<p>CHECKLIST: Suggested Steps</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Teacher finds one or more partners to join them in doing &quot;Peer Review” instead of Teacher-Principal evaluation.</p>
<p>Name(s) of Partner(s):_</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers read and discuss the California Standards for The Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers obtain approval from the principal.</p>
<p>Principal’s Approval_Date:_</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers plan a process for peer review which may include.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom observation</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation with other teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversations about curriculum and instruction</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School visits</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workshops, conferences, etc.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other</p>
<p>(VUSD will contribute the cost of 'A day Substitute Teacher for each pair of teachers doing peer review.)</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read suggested conversation topics and consider having a discussion regarding topics.</p>
<p>(Suggested Conversation Topics)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your hopes and intentions for Peer Review?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the most important knowledge and skill competencies for my job?</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What standards (from the California Standards for Teaching Profession) are of the most interest or need to me at this<br/>time? Note: We advise that you focus on 1 or 2 standards. This will make it easier to make your observations and collect<br/>evidence related to meeting a standard. You may want to cover all five standards over 3-4 years.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I know about my current performance as a Teacher (i.e. strengths, needs, interests, etc.)?</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get better information about my performance as a teacher?</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the next steps I would like to take to improve and enhance my performance as a teacher?</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can my colleagues, Principal, students, etc., help me to grow and develop professionally?</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an Improvement Plan is needed, note in written document and refer to principal.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written documentation of the Peer Review process that was implemented submitted to the Principal and signed during the post<br/>conference prior to April 13.</p>

<p>CHECKLIST FOR THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS</p>
<p>Permanent Counselors may choose to do “Peer Review” as an alternative to Principal-Counselor performance evaluation. With the Principal’s<br/>endorsement, Permanent Counselors can work together to review Counselor performance and support each other in pursuing professional growth<br/>activities. The purpose of Peer Review is to give experienced counselors more responsibility for increasing their skills and an opportunity to design<br/>an individual process that will be most helpful to them.</p>
<p>CHECKLIST: Suggested Steps</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Counselor finds one or more partners to join them in doing “Peer Review” instead of Counselor-Principal evaluation.</p>
<p>Name(s) of Partner(s):_</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors read and discuss the Pupil Personnel Services Perfonnance Standards.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors obtain approval from the principal.</p>
<p>Principal’s Approval_Date:_</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors plan a process for peer review which may include.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site observation</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation with other counselors</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversations about programs and services</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School visits</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workshops, conferences, etc.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read suggested conversation topics and consider having a discussion regarding topics.</p>
<p>(Suggested Conversation Topics)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your hopes and intentions for Peer Review?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most important knowledge and skill competencies for my job?</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What standards (from the Pupil Personnel Services Performance Standards) are of the most interest or need to me<br/>at this time? Note: We advise that you focus on 1 or 2 standards. This will make it easier to make your observations<br/>and collect evidence related to meeting a standard. You may want to cover all five standards over 3-4 years.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I know about my current performance as a Counselor (i.e. strengths, needs, interests, etc.)?</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get better information about my performance as a Counselor?</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the next steps I would like to take to improve and enhance my performance as a counselor?</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my colleagues, Principal, students, etc., help me to grow and develop professionally?</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an Improvement Plan is needed, note in written document and refer to principal.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written documentation of the Peer Review process that was implemented submitted to the Principal and signed during the post conference prior<br/>to April 13.</p>

These six (6) standards shall provide the goals/framework for VUSD Speech Pathologist<br/>evaluation. There is no need to write goals and objectives.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in learning.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and organizing objectives/lessons for student learning.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing student learning.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a professional Speech/Language Pathologist.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the Policy</p>
<p>One-half of the permanent staff will be formally evaluated each year.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Conference Guidelines (for Temporary, Probationary and Permanent Bargaining Unit Members)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-conference for bargaining unit members to be evaluated will be held by October 31. The purpose of the pre¬<br/>conference is to review the Speech/Language Pathologist Standards to determine the evaluation focus. At that time the<br/>evaluator and the bargaining unit member may agree that some elements of the standards are not applicable (NA) to<br/>the employee’s assignment and may mark them NA at that time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is disagreement about which of the elements is not applicable (NA), the parties may invite the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Certificated Human Resources to assist in resolving the differences. The Assistant Superintendent<br/>shall recommend alternatives to the unit member and evaluator.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary/Temporary Bargaining Unit Members - A minimum of three conferences between the bargaining unit member and<br/>the evaluator shall be held each year.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pre-conference shall be held by October 31.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring evaluation conference shall be held 60 days prior to the last regular school day. A written copy of the<br/>evaluation will be provided to the permanent bargaining unit member 60 days prior to the last regular school day.</p>
<p>Appendix A</p>
<p>Page 13</p>
<p>3. Permanent personnel may elect to have another permanent bargaining unit member do their evaluation with their<br/>administrator’s approval (see checklist for Peer Review Process). Peer Review must be completed by April 13, if<br/>not, the process reverts back to site administrator who has until May 30 to complete Evaluation Process.</p>
<p>III. Responsibility for Evaluation</p>
<p>The Superintendent will designate each building principal as the individual responsible for notifying the bargaining unit member of<br/>unsatisfactory performance. At the District level, the Superintendent will designate the individuals who are responsible for evaluation.</p>
<p>The building principal has the primary responsibility for the evaluation of all bargaining unit members assigned to the site. The principal<br/>may share these duties with the assistant principal(s), other certificated administrators or other approved staff, as outlined above.</p>
<p>IV. On the Job Observation - Visitations</p>
<p>There shall be a minimum number of two observations for Probationary/Temporary bargaining unit members and one observation for<br/>permanent bargaining unit members made with their full knowledge. Observations may be scheduled or un-scheduled, at the request<br/>of the bargaining unit member. Additional observations may be requested by the evaluator and the bargaining unit member or by the<br/>evaluator. A conference between the evaluator and the bargaining unit member shall be scheduled not more than five school days after<br/>any observation, if the observation is to be used as part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>V. Improvement Plan</p>
<p>An Improvement Plan is necessary when the evaluator marks Needs Improvement Plan or Unsatisfactory on the evaluation form. The<br/>Improvement Plan will describe how the bargaining unit member needs to improve.</p>
<p>When an Improvement Plan is needed, the principal/designated administrator will write the Improvement Plan. At the bargaining unit<br/>member’s request, the VUEA President, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, the bargaining unit member and the immediate<br/>supervisor will meet within ten working days of the original evaluation to review the Improvement Plan.</p>
<p>VI. Procedure for Reaction or Response</p>
<p>If the bargaining unit member is in disagreement with the evaluation, he/she shall have the right to initiate a written response. The<br/>written response shall become a permanent attachment to the bargaining unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>VII. Policy Review</p>
<p>Any future changes to these evaluation procedures must be negotiated between VUEA and VUSD.</p>

<p>CHECKLIST FOR THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS</p>
<p>Permanent Nurses may choose to do “Peer Review” as an alternative to Principal/Site Supervisor-Nurse performance evaluation. With the<br/>Principal/Site Supervisor’s endorsement, Permanent Nurses can work together to review Nurse performance and support each other in pursuing<br/>professional growth activities. The purpose of Peer Review is to give experienced Nurses more responsibility for increasing their skills and an<br/>opportunity to design an individual process that will be most helpful to them.</p>
<p>CHECKLIST: Suggested Steps</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Nurse finds one or more partners to join them in doing “Peer Review” instead of Nurse-Principal/Site Supervisor evaluation.</p>
<p>Name(s) of Partner(s):_</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses read and discuss the Standards for the Nurse Profession.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses obtain approval from the principal.</p>
<p>Principal’s Approval_Date:_</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses plan a process for peer review which may include.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work observation</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation with other Nurses.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversations about profession, procedures, best practices, etc.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School visits</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workshops, conferences, etc.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read suggested conversation topics and consider having a discussion regarding topics.</p>
<p>(Suggested Conversation Topics)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your hopes and intentions for Peer Review?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the most important knowledge and skill competencies for my job?</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What standards (from the Nurse Profession) are of the most interest or need to me at this time? Note: We advise that you focus on 1<br/>or 2 standards. This will make it easier to make your observations and collect evidence related to meeting a standard. You may want<br/>to cover all standards over 3-4 years.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I know about my current performance as a Nurse (i.e. strengths, needs, interests, etc.)?</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get better information about my performance as a Nurse?</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the next steps I would like to take to improve and enhance my performance as a Nurse.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can my colleagues, Principal, students, etc., help me to grow and develop professionally?</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an Improvement Plan is needed, note in written document and refer to principal/site supervisor.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written documentation of the Peer Review process that was implemented submitted to the Principal/site supervisor and signed during the post<br/>conference prior to April 13.</p>

<p>If “Needs Improvement” or “Unsatisfactory&quot; is marked on the employee’s evaluation form, the Evaluator must write an<br/>Improvement Plan to describe how the bargaining unit member needs to improve his/her job performance. This plan<br/>should include specific area(s) for improvement and recommendations of avenues of assistance.</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members have the right to VUEA representation during this process. At the bargaining unit member’s<br/>request, the bargaining unit member and his/her representative will meet with the evaluator within thirty calendar<br/>days of the original evaluation to review the Improvement Plan.</p>
<p>Area(s) for Improvement (See “Reference Set” for a complete description of the standards):</p>
<p>The bargaining unit member shall have the right to initiate a written response to the improvement plan. The written response<br/>shall become a permanent attachment to the bargaining unit member’s personnel file.</p>

<p>VUSD invites your participation in using the Teacher Transfer Policy as agreed with<br/>the Ventura Unified Educators Association (see Article XI, Assignment and Transfer in<br/>the Collective Bargaining Agreement).</p>
<p>Each year, bargaining unit members who desire a transfer to a different school site<br/>must file a request with Certificated Human Resources. Although it is not always<br/>possible to accommodate requests, careful consideration will be given. The first list of<br/>known vacancies will be posted not later than April 20<sup>th</sup> at each school. A<br/>supplemental list of known vacancies is posted not later than June 15<sup>th</sup>. If a bargaining<br/>unit member does not receive a new assignment following the first posting, the request<br/>will also be considered during the supplemental posting period.</p>
<p>To maximize your transfer opportunities, indicate all grades/subject areas you would<br/>consider.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a bargaining unit member wishes to be considered for transfer during the<br/>summer months, make sure Certificated Human Resources has your summer address<br/>and telephone number. Transfer requests are destroyed after October 31<sup>st</sup> of each<br/>school year. Bargaining unit members must file a new request each year to continue<br/>being considered for a transfer.</p>
<p>Please return all copies of this form. Certificated Human Resources will initial receipt<br/>and return a copy to you. Your current building principal will also receive a copy.</p>

<p>As a general practice and whenever possible (with the exception for cleaning or repair by maintenance<br/>personnel), please provide prior notification to classroom teachers when accessing classrooms for any<br/>reason during non-school time. If there is an emergency, and there is no reasonable opportunity to provide<br/>prior notification, please contact the teacher to explain why it was necessary to enter the classroom. If anything<br/>is removed, make certain the item(s) are identified/inventoried before they are removed.</p>
<p>Teachers invest a lot of energy and time to make their workspace well organized and attractive for students.<br/>They have a right to feel &quot;ownership” and be protective of their workspace. Therefore, it is expected as a<br/>matter of courtesy and respect, teachers will be fully informed about the reasons access is necessary or has<br/>occurred. In addition, it is very important to insure that confidential information in classrooms is protected and<br/>secure. If it is necessary to allow student/parent access to classrooms, make certain they are supervised, if or<br/>when this occurs.</p>
<p>If there is a violation of this notice, employees are authorized to use the District Uniform Complaint Procedure if<br/>necessary.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to these matters.</p>

<p>Request for Job Share: Bargaining unit members who are interested in creating a new job share-partnership must<br/>submit a request to the site principal by March 1<sup>st</sup> for the next school year. The principal makes the recommendation to<br/>the Superintendent’s designee based on the school and its needs, the students it serves, and the interest of teachers.<br/>The Superintendent’s designee shall approve or deny the request. A response to the request shall be communicated in<br/>writing to the bargaining unit member within 30 calendar days of the application. The decision of the Superintendent’s<br/>designee shall be final. If the employee requests the reason for denial it will be put in writing and sent to employee.</p>
<p>Job Calendar: In order to insure program quality, continuity and fit at the school site, salary compensation, sick leave<br/>grant accounting, and substitute coverage, job share partners must complete a job share calendar and have it approved<br/>by the site principal.

<p>Job Share Extensions: Job shares shall be granted on a yearly basis. An extension may be granted if recommended by<br/>principal and approved by Superintendent's designee. Permanent reductions of an assignment will not be granted. Job<br/>share participants must notify the site principal in writing by March 1 of their desire to continue the job share<br/>arrangements. Requests for changes must be given to the principal by March 1. If bargaining unit members do not<br/>provide notification or if continuation of the job share assignment is not approved, the bargaining unit members shall be<br/>returned to the prior time base the bargaining unit members held immediately prior to their job share assignment.</p>
<p>Responsibilities: Both bargaining unit members will:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide instruction for their portions of the instructional program, plus preparation time.</p>
