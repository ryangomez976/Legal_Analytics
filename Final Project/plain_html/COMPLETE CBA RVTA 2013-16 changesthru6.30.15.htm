<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the domestic partners marries.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic partners no longer have a common residence. A<br/>temporary separation resulting from work, education, or health<br/>related requirements shall not constitute the cessation of a common<br/>residence.</p>

<p>The employee shall also file with the District a signed Statement of Financial<br/>Liability indicating that the employee agrees that he or she may be required to<br/>reimburse the District and/or the District’s designated health services plan for any<br/>expenditures made by the District and/or the District’s designated health plan<br/>services for medical claims, processing fees, administrative charges, costs, and<br/>attorneys fees on behalf of the domestic partner if any of the submitted<br/>documentation is found to be incomplete, inaccurate, or fraudulent. The<br/>Statement shall further indicate that the employee agrees to indemnify the District<br/>for any loss the District suffers as a result of the employee’s failure to file the<br/>Notice of Termination of the Domestic Partnership.</p>

<p>LEAVES</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided employees by Sections 44962 through 44985,44800 and 44801 of<br/>the Education Code are incorporated into this Agreement except as supplemented in the<br/>Article.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>
<p>10.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each full time employee shall be entitled to 10 days of paid sick leave each school<br/>year, including summer school.</p>
<p>10.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sick leave may be used on the first assigned work day.</p>
<p>10.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused sick leave shall accrue from school year to school year.</p>
<p>10.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than October 1, each employee shall receive a written statement of his/her<br/>sick leave allotment credit and of his/her sick leave entitlement for the school<br/>year. An employee may use his/her credited sick leave at any time during the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>10.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should an employee resign or retire, his/her total accumulated sick leave as<br/>otherwise set forth in this document may be used in any one of the following</p>
<p>ways:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be transferred to another public employer in the State of California<br/>as provided under strict provisions of law.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be credited to the employee's STRS account.</p>
<p>10.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who work less than full time shall receive sick leave in the proportion<br/>that their work week bears to a full time work week for a full-time employee in a<br/>comparable position.</p>
<p>10.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent may require a physician's verification of illness of any<br/>employee who has been on sick leave for six (6) or more consecutive days.</p>
<p>10.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent may require a physician's verification that the employee is<br/>physically fit to return to duty may be required of any employee who has been<br/>absent from duty for six (6) consecutive work days prior to payment.</p>
<p>10.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-time unit member may use up to six (6) days of accrued and available sick<br/>leave annually to attend to an illness of a child, parent, or spouse. This use shall<br/>be subject to the same conditions and restrictions that apply to the unit member’s<br/>use of sick leave for his/her own illness. This sick leave entitlement shall not<br/>extend the maximum period of leave to which the employee is entitled under<br/>Government Code section 12945.2 or the Family Medical Leave Act.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>10.3 Maternity Disability Leave</p>
<p>A female employee is entitled to leave for disability caused or contributed to by<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom for the period of time<br/>determined by the employee and her physician. During her period of disability, the<br/>employee may collect first her current year's sick leave, then her accumulated sick leave<br/>followed by up to five school months of differential pay with the recommendation of her<br/>physician. An employee on maternity leave will not start using her 12-week period of<br/>paid or unpaid family care leave entitlement until after her disability period has ended.</p>
<p>The District may, however, count prenatal care visits against the employee's family and<br/>medical leave entitlement. An employee shall give notice to the District of pregnancy as<br/>soon as possible, but not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expected birth of the child.<br/>An employee may continue to work until such time as she and her physician deem that<br/>her physical inability to perform her duties requires the commencement of maternity<br/>disability leave.</p>
<p>The District shall not, because of an employee's pregnancy:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discharge her from employment;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bar her from training programs leading to employment, reassignment, or<br/>promotion; or</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discriminate against her in compensation or in terms, conditions or<br/>privileges of employment.</p>
<p>Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery<br/>therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as<br/>such under any health insurance and sick leave plan as soon as the contracted carrier<br/>makes this coverage available. Such disabilities shall be treated in all respects on the<br/>same terms and conditions applied to other temporary disabilities.</p>
<p>10.4 Leave Without Pay for Child-Bearing Preparation and Child Rearing</p>
<p>Leave without pay may be granted to an employee for preparation for childbirth and for<br/>child rearing immediately following birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child<br/>beyond the employee’s entitlement to maternity disability leave and family care and<br/>medical leave, if any. If the employee is eligible for family care and medical leave, such<br/>leave will be taken concurrently with the leave without pay under this section.</p>
<p>Where such leaves are taken concurrently, the employee will continue to participate in<br/>any group health care benefits plan under the same terms and conditions, including any<br/>necessary co-payments, by which the employee was enrolled prior to the first day of the<br/>leave. After an employee's entitlement to family care and medical leave has been<br/>exhausted, the employee granted leave without pay shall be entitled to continue to receive<br/>health and welfare benefits provided the employee pays the premium.</p>
<p>The employee shall request such leave as soon as practicable, but no less than thirty (30)<br/>days prior to the date on which the leave is to begin for the foreseeable birth, adoption, or<br/>foster care placement of a child. Such request shall be in writing and shall include a<br/>statement as to the dates the employee wishes to begin and end the leave without pay.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Where the duration of the leave requested exceeds the employee's entitlement under the<br/>family care and medical leave acts, the Superintendent shall have the discretion to<br/>determine the duration of the leave in consideration of the scheduling and replacement<br/>problems of the District. The duration of the combined leaves shall consist of no more<br/>than twelve (12) consecutive months, and shall terminate no later than June 30 in the last<br/>school year in which such leave is taken. An extension of leave may be granted, not to<br/>exceed an additional twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>10.5 Extended Illness and Accident Leave</p>
<p>10.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee has utilized all of his/her accumulated sick leave and is still absent<br/>from his/her duties on account of illness or accident, he/she may borrow 10 days<br/>of paid sick leave from the following year. In turn, the employee shall agree in<br/>writing to repay upon resignation or within 2 years, whichever is sooner, any<br/>monies owed the Board as a result of there being at that time an excess of used<br/>sick leave days over the earned sick leave days.</p>
<p>10.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all earned leave as set forth in paragraph 10.5.1 is exhausted, additional non-<br/>accumulated leave shall be available to provide for an extended illness and<br/>accident leave period. During this period, the employee shall be paid the<br/>difference between the pay of the substitute or the amount that would have been<br/>paid the substitute (if no substitute is employed) and the employee's daily rate of<br/>pay. The maximum length of differential pay leave shall be five (5) months.</p>
<p>10.6 Industrial Accident or Illness Leave</p>
<p>Employees will be entitled to industrial accident leave according to the provisions of<br/>Education Code Section 44984 for illness or injury which has qualified for workers<br/>compensation under the provisions of the State Compensation Insurance Fund.</p>
<p>Such leave shall not exceed sixty (60) days during which the schools of the District are<br/>required to be in session or when the employee would otherwise have been performing<br/>work for the District in any one fiscal year for the same industrial accident. When an<br/>industrial accident or illness extends into the next fiscal year, the employee shall be<br/>entitled to use only the amount of unused leave remaining.</p>
<p>The sixty (60) day leave benefits provided in this paragraph are in addition to sick leave<br/>benefits. Accordingly, the District shall not deduct accumulated sick leave from the sick<br/>leave allotment of a teacher who is absent as the result of an industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>Should the employee be unable to return to work following the sixty (60) days, sick leave<br/>benefits may then be utilized.</p>
<p>The District has the right to have the employee examined by a physician designated by<br/>the District to assist in determining the length of time during which the employee will be<br/>temporarily unable to perform assigned duties and the degree to which a disability is<br/>attributable to the injury involved.</p>
<p>A teacher shall be deemed to have recovered from an industrial accident or illness, and<br/>thereby able to return to work at such time he/she and his/her physician agree that there<br/>has been such a recovery.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>For any days of absence from duty as a result of the same industrial accident, the<br/>employee shall receive his/her full salary and shall endorse to the District any wage loss<br/>benefit checks from the State Compensation Insurance Fund.</p>
<p>If the employee fails to endorse to the District any wage loss disability indemnity check<br/>received on account of the industrial accident or illness as provided above, the District<br/>shall deduct from the employee's salary warrant the amount of such disability indemnity<br/>actually paid to and retained by the employee.</p>
<p>10.7 Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>10.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may use a maximum of ten (10) days of sick leave of absence<br/>per school year for personal necessity.</p>
<p>10.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave may be used for matters of personal importance.</p>
<p>10.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, the teacher will give the site administrator advance notice,<br/>except for leave taken for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death or serious illness of immediate family-spouse, child, parent, sibling</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accident</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matters of personal importance</p>
<p>10.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity may not be used as vacation.</p>
<p>10.8 Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>Unit members are entitled to a leave of absence not to exceed three (3) days, or five (5)<br/>days if travel of more than five hundred (500) miles one way or out of state is required,<br/>on account of the death of any member of the unit member's immediate family. No<br/>deduction shall be made from the salary of such employee nor shall such leave be<br/>deducted from leave granted by other sections of the Education Code or provided by the<br/>Governing Board of the District. Members of the immediate family mean the mother,<br/>mother-in-law, father, father-in-law, stepmother, stepfather, grandmother, grandfather, or<br/>a grandchild of the employee or of the spouse of the employee, and the spouse, registered<br/>domestic partner, son, stepson, son-in-law, daughter, stepdaughter, daughter-in-law,<br/>brother, or sister of the unit member, or any others living in the immediate household of<br/>the employee. Bereavement leave for any other person requires approval of the unit<br/>member's immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>10.9 Judicial Leave</p>
<p>The Board shall grant a leave of absence with pay to an employee who is called to appear<br/>in court as a juror or subpoenaed witness on behalf of the district. Pay for the above leave<br/>shall not exceed fifteen (15) days. Any remuneration for such appearance will be<br/>returned to the District.</p>
<p>Note: If an employee is subpoenaed by another party on district business, he/she is entitled to a<br/>witness fee. If the employee is on paid time, the witness fee should be requested.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>10.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Leave</p>
<p>A cumulative total of no more than seven (7) days of release time shall be granted to<br/>elected officials of the Association to perform Association business and for processing<br/>grievances. Officials desiring to take Association leave shall give written notice to the<br/>Superintendent no later than three (3) calendar days preceding the date(s) of absence.</p>
<p>The Association shall reimburse the District for substitute's pay.</p>
<p>10.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncompensated Leave<br/>Short-Term Uncompensated Leave</p>
<p>At the discretion of the Board of Trustees, an employee may be granted a short-term<br/>uncompensated leave during the school year. He/she shall receive no compensation<br/>during such leave. The employee shall submit a written request for the Board of Trustees<br/>to secure advance permission for short-term uncompensated leave.</p>
<p>Long-Term Uncompensated Leave</p>
<p>At the discretion of the Board of Trustees, an employee may be granted a leave of<br/>absence for up to one year. The employee shall submit a written request to the<br/>Board of Trustees to secure advance permission for the initial leave period. Any<br/>extension of the initial leave period is subject to the Superintendent’s<br/>recommendation and the Board’s approval. There shall be no compensation for<br/>such leave and no salary increment shall accrue during it. However, if an<br/>employee has obtained prior approval from the Superintendent for teaching<br/>elsewhere, appropriate salary increment shall accrue. An employee shall be<br/>entitled to continue to receive health and welfare benefits provided he/she prepays<br/>the premiums.</p>
<p>Employees granted such leaves of absence shall notify the District Superintendent<br/>prior to February 1 of the year during which the leave is being taken, that the<br/>employee will return for duty the ensuing school year.</p>
<p>If not notified, it is assumed the employee will not return and the employee will<br/>not be guaranteed an assignment.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XIII</p>
<p>PART-TIME TEACHING EMPLOYMENT AND SHARED CONTRACTS</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>13.1 Part-time contacts and shared contracts, between two employees, may be available to<br/>certificated employees at the employee’s request and on the basis of District need.</p>
<p>A shared contract is defined as one in which one (1) position is shared by two (2)<br/>Certificated Employees.</p>
<p>Procedure for Job Shares</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By February 1 of the year preceding the year of the proposed shared contract, individual<br/>teachers wishing to job share during the next school year must check the appropriate box<br/>on and return the Intent to Return form to the Human Resources Department. Teachers<br/>participating in a job share contract must be in tenured status in the year in which the job<br/>share contract will be implemented.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By February 15, the Human Resources Department will publish a list of all persons who<br/>have expressed an interest in shared contract employment based on requests received.<br/>Interested eligible teachers will attempt to find a shared contract partner among those<br/>listed on the list. By March 15, those wishing to share a position shall submit a proposal<br/>unless this date is waived by the Board.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each request shall be supported by a detailed proposal regarding each employee’s<br/>responsibilities and duties including, but not limited to, the duties described below. The<br/>written request will insure the continuity of the class and smooth transition which shall<br/>not result in an increased cost to the District:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the job share proposal</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits to the District, students and employees involved</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the employees plan to implement the job share position</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of how the teachers intend to coordinate their work</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A communication plan about how the job-share partners will share information about<br/>students, staff meetings and in-services.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate overlap to ensure a smooth transition</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a job share partner is not found among current tenured employees, the District has the<br/>option to employ a temporary or substitute employee as a job share partner. Approval<br/>shall be contingent upon the District’s ability to obtain a suitable job share partner. The<br/>District retains the right to make the final decision about who is hired. In the event the<br/>District is unable to fund a suitable partner, the employee must either return to full-time<br/>status, request a full uncompensated leave of absence, or resign.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each request will be evaluated in terms of its benefit to the District’s educational program<br/>and the welfare of the students by the Administrative Cabinet. If approved by the</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Administrative Cabinet, the Superintendent will recommend implementation by the<br/>Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By April 15<sup>th</sup> requests will be approved or denied by the Board on a case-by-case basis,<br/>based on the best interests of the District.</p>
<p>13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job share employees will meet with the site principal on or before October 15-31 and<br/>January 15-31 to discuss how the shared contract partnership is being implemented. The<br/>site Principal shall indicate any areas of concern to the teachers so the teachers may<br/>address them.</p>
<p>13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No partner in a job share contract may work less than a .4 F.T.E.</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees with part-time or shared contracts will return to full-time employment, if<br/>qualified, the following year unless a new request is granted. In no case will the<br/>employee returning from a part-time shared contract be denied a full-time position the<br/>following year, unless he/she does not quality for a full-time position.</p>
<p>13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members intending to return to full-time status the following year must notify the<br/>District of their intent to do so by February 1. Failure to do so will result in the<br/>expectation the employee will return to full-time status.</p>
<p>13.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers wishing to continue a job sharing arrangement for the following year shall<br/>indicate such on the Intent to Return form and re-submit their proposal with any<br/>necessary changes by March 15.</p>
<p>Work Responsibilities</p>
<p>13.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the employment on a part-time or shared contract, the employees and the<br/>principal will mutually agree on actual time to be spent at school, attendance at teacher<br/>meetings, non-student work days, parent/teacher conferences, report cards and grading,<br/>participation on District committees, attendance at district meetings and other duties<br/>required of full-time employees on a pro-rated basis. The terms of this agreement<br/>between the employee and the principal shall be in writing.</p>
<p>13.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both partners will attend Back to School Night and Open House.</p>
<p>13.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher is responsible to fully inform the job sharing partner of<br/>meetings held on a day when that partner is not working.</p>
<p>13.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both partners will attend Staff Development Days.</p>
<p>13.13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined number of work days of both participants on a shared<br/>contract shall not exceed the total number of work days required on a<br/>regular contract, not including staff development days.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Salary and Benefits</p>
<p>13.14 Compensation will be established in conjunction with the current Certificated Salary<br/>Schedule.</p>
<p>13.14.1</p>

<p>If the presence of a shared contract employee is required on a non-work<br/>day for teacher training or in-service staff development, compensation will<br/>be paid at the employee’s per diem rate.</p>
<p>Employees on a part-time or shared contract will be credited with a year of<br/>experience credit for step advancement at the end of one year if they have<br/>taught at least 75% of the contract work year. Employees teaching less<br/>than 75% of the contract work year will be credited with a year of<br/>experience for step advancement at the end of two consecutive years.<br/>Substitute time is not allowable for this provision.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVII</p>
<p>RETIREMENT OPTIONS</p>
<p>17.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>17.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District shall notify all unit members on or before December 15 as to which<br/>retirement options will be available for the end of that school year. An employee<br/>may select only one option. Employees must apply to participate in a retirement<br/>option no later than February 1 of the year preceding the year of requested<br/>participation. Employee requests submitted after February 1 shall be considered<br/>on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>17.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board reserves the right to limit the number of participants in any one or all<br/>retirement options programs except for Golden Handshake, which if offered, shall<br/>have no limit as to the number of unit members participating. Should a limit be<br/>placed on any of the options and there are more applicants than allowed, then the<br/>selection of successful applicant shall be based on the unit member’s seniority in<br/>the District. Implementation of this Article is dependent upon program needs and<br/>financial constraints of the District and legislation which affects the ability of the<br/>District to offer these options.</p>
<p>17.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual renewal of the Consultancy/Early Retirement Incentive Program (ERIP),<br/>and Supplemental Retirement Income Program (SRIP), will be subject to mutual<br/>agreement. The Board and Association will begin negotiations on implementation<br/>of the (ERIP), (SRIP), and other issues which have a financial impact on the<br/>District's budget, by November 1 of each year of this Agreement. This might<br/>include the number of participants in relation to available funds. The parties may<br/>negotiate other financial issues before November 1 and prior to negotiating on<br/>retirement, if they choose.</p>
<p>17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement with Consultancy/Early Retirement Incentive Program (ERIP).</p>
<p>17.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person would be eligible for this program by serving satisfactorily in the<br/>District for a minimum of ten (10) years as a certificated staff member.</p>
<p>17.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only persons who have attained the age of 55 and are eligible for the State<br/>Teacher Retirement benefits shall be eligible for this program when they retire.</p>
<p>17.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must submit a written resignation no later than March 1 and have it<br/>accepted by the Board, to be effective no later than June 30, of the year preceding<br/>participation in this program. The resignation must be submitted in the year in<br/>which it is effective.</p>
<p>17.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year of the program, the Superintendent and the employee shall mutually<br/>determine the consultancy services to be rendered and shall reduce to writing a<br/>description of such services. The written description shall be attached to the<br/>Consultancy/ERIP agreement. Any change in services during the contract year<br/>shall be made only as mutually agreed to by the employee and the Superintendent.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>17.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties hereby agree that as part of the consideration for a contract, the<br/>District will renew the contract annually for four (4) years, or until the retiree<br/>reaches age 65, whichever comes first. Renewal will be contingent upon the<br/>satisfactory performance by the retiree in each prior year. Conditions for<br/>determining satisfactory performance shall be agreed to in writing by both parties.</p>
<p>17.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A participant’s annual compensation for consultancy services shall be a minimum<br/>of $5,000 and shall not exceed the maximum established by STRS. The rate of<br/>pay for this employment shall be the retiree's effective daily rate for the school<br/>year preceding the year in which the employee retired.</p>
<p>17.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees between the age of 55 and 65 shall, with the approval of the carrier,<br/>remain entitled to medical coverage provided the employee pays the premium<br/>costs. Employees on Early Retirement Consultancy contracts may elect to have the<br/>District pay the premium costs for such benefits and reduce the consultancy<br/>payments by a like amount.</p>
<p>17.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants will earn credit for Medicare.</p>
<p>17.3 Golden Handshake</p>
<p>When the retirement option of Golden Handshake (Education Code sections<br/>23714 and 44929, et seq.) is offered by the District then the program’s legal and<br/>cost saving requirements must be met.</p>
<p>17.4 Reduced Workload - Education Code Section 22713</p>
<p>17.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee is &quot;qualified&quot; to apply for reduced workload if (1) he/she<br/>will be at least 55 years of age on or before the effective date of the reduction in<br/>workload, and (2) he/she has been employed full-time in a position requiring<br/>membership in STRS for at least 10 years of which the five years immediately<br/>preceding the reduction in workload were full-time employment without a break<br/>in service.</p>
<p>17.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;qualified&quot; certificated employee may elect to reduce his/her workload from<br/>full-time to part-time duties and receive (1) the State Teachers' Retirement System<br/>(&quot;STRS&quot;) service credit he/she would have received if employed full-time and (2)<br/>any other benefits that he/she is entitled to under STRS based upon the salary<br/>he/she would have received if employed on a full-time basis.</p>
<p>17.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time STRS service credit shall be granted on a semester-by-semester basis. If<br/>employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily prior to the conclusion of a<br/>full semester, the employee will receive retirement credit for the partial semester<br/>in the same proportion that the employee's part-time salary bears to the salary the<br/>employee would have received if employed fulltime.</p>
<p>17.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum part-time employment under the reduced workload program shall<br/>be the equivalent of one-half of the number of days of service required by the<br/>employee's contract of employment during his/her final year of service in a full-</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>time position. The actual percentage of time employed shall be determined by<br/>mutual consent of the employee and the District. An employee may not return to<br/>full-time service or otherwise change his/her percentage of time employed without<br/>the consent of the District.</p>
<p>17.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of part-time employment shall not exceed 10 years. Each employee<br/>shall sign an agreement to retire from the District before or at the end of the<br/>period of participation in the reduced workload program.</p>
<p>17.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the employee's participation in the reduced workload program, the<br/>employee shall be paid the pro-rata share of the salary the employee would have<br/>earned had the employee been employed full-time and shall be eligible for health<br/>and welfare benefits on the same basis as other part-time employees. The<br/>employee and the District shall contribute to STRS the amount that each would<br/>have contributed had the employee been employed full-time.</p>
<p>17.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduced workload option must be requested by the employee and agreed to by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>17.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplemental Retirement Income Program</p>
<p>17.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees wishing to participate in this plan must be at least 55 years of age and<br/>have served for five years in the District. An employee must submit a written<br/>resignation which is accepted by the Board no later than March 1 of the year in<br/>which he/she intends to retire and the resignation must be effective no later than<br/>June 30 of the same year.</p>
<p>17.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this plan, the employee will select an income protection program and notify<br/>the District of the program and the contribution arrangement. The District will<br/>contribute a total of $20,000 to this plan based on a schedule, not to exceed five<br/>years.</p>
<p>17.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District assumes no responsibility or liability for taxes or any other<br/>consequences, of the individual's participation in this retirement plan.</p>
<p>17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement Bonuses</p>
<p>Based on annual Board of Trustees discretion, the retirement bonuses will be reviewed<br/>and available funding will be discussed and determined.</p>
<p>To be eligible, a unit member must:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete 15 years of service and be 55 years of age or older</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a member of STRS</p>
<p>All bonuses require annual board approval through negotiations. A side letter will be<br/>provided which outlines annual agreements. All agreements are for single-year only.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVIII</p>
<p>GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed and understood by the parties that during the term of this Agreement the<br/>members of the Unit shall faithfully and diligently perform all of the duties normally<br/>associated with their positions.</p>
<p>In the event employees who are represented by the Unit participate in a strike, work<br/>stoppage, slow-down, or other interference with the operations of the District, the<br/>Association agrees in good faith to take all necessary steps to cause those employees to<br/>cease such action.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic<br/>SHC (e.g., epilepsy, muscular sclerosis, asthma, diabetes, etc.);</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any period of incapacity that is permanent or longterm due to a condition<br/>for which treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer's, severe stroke,<br/>terminal states of a disease); or</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period<br/>of recovery), by a HCP or by a provider of health care services under orders<br/>of or on referral by a HCP, either for (a) restorative surgery after an<br/>accident or other injury, or (b) for a condition that would likely result in a<br/>period of incapacity of more than 3 consecntive calendar days in the<br/>absence of medical intervention (eg., chemotherapy tor cancer, physical<br/>therapy for arthritis, or dialysis for kidney disease).</p>
<p>* “Regimen, of Continuing Treatment&quot; includes, for example, a course of<br/>prescription medication (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment to<br/>alleviate the health condition; it does not include taking over-the-counter<br/>medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves; nor does it include bed-rest,<br/>drinking fluids, exercise or other similar activities if initiated without the<br/>involvement of a HCP.</p>

<p>NOTE: Unless complications arise, the common cold, flu, ear aches, upset<br/>stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraines, routine dental or orthodontia<br/>problems are not conditions that meet the definition of a SHC to qualify for family<br/>and medical leave (FMLA)</p>

<p>It is recognized that all school districts are having difficulty in obtaining substitute teachers. Therefore, the</p>
<p>following side letter is agreed to for the middle school only when a substitute is not available:.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pool of middle school teachers will be created for each period of the school day. Certificated staff will<br/>be asked ahead of time if they wish to be a part of the pool. Certificated staffhave a right to decline to<br/>participate in this program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated staff who choose to participate in the pool may, on a given day, decline to take a period<br/>substitute coverage if it is not convenient.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated staff will be paid at a rate of $25.00 an hour per period.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no certificated staff member is available and willing to substitute on a period basis, a site administrator<br/>will cover the period.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If a certificated staff member need to be out for half a day and no half day substitute is available, the<br/>certificated staff member will take a full day absence and the substitute may be used to perform other<br/>services at the middle school as determined by the site administrator.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faculty members can trade time and not be compensated by salary, but by reciprocal coverage.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-8 substitutes will be given priority placement.</p>
