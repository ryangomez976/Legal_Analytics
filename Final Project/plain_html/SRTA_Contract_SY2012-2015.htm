The District administration shall establish reasonable and fair<br/>apportionment of extra-curricular duty assignments, provided that the unit members of the<br/>work site shall be consulted in the setting of procedures for such allocation of duties.</p>
<p>Extra-duty assignments should be generally consistent at similar schools;<br/>however, the particular characteristics of a given school reasonably require different levels<br/>of such assignments. Those characteristics include, but are not limited to, grade-level<br/>configuration, student population, transportation, physical characteristics of the site,<br/>programs, and staffing. Accordingly, disputes over such assignments should be referred to<br/>the Superintendent or his /her designee for review prior to the filing of a formal grievance.<br/>Extra-curricular duty assignments are defined as school-related activities not falling within<br/>the scope of regular curriculum which are conducted during and after the regular workday<br/>and which include routine student supervision of not more than fifteen (15) minutes before<br/>the regular workday.</p>
<p>Extra-curricular duty assignments, other than routine student supervision, will not<br/>begin more than fifteen (15) minutes before or continue more than fifteen (15) minutes<br/>after the time students are required to be in the classroom. Routine student supervision<br/>may be assigned as required to accommodate bus schedules, but in no case shall such<br/>assignments begin more than thirty (30) minutes before the first class period at the site; any</p>
<p>teacher so assigned should be permitted to leave early as compensation for the actual time<br/>required for such duty, provided that such early departure does not conflict with other<br/>professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Board of Education reserves the right to determine curriculum, the<br/>Board also understands that under the Rodda Act there is the provision for<br/>consultation on enumerated educational matters. The District will ensure that<br/>when consulting with the Association President and Chief Negotiator (subsequent<br/>to ratification of this provision) on trainings during the non-work year of the<br/>certificated unit member, the District will also bargain those items that fall within<br/>the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p>14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure flexibility for programs to meet changing educational needs, constraints on class<br/>sizes shall be limited. District management shall provide the Association with data on<br/>class sizes and, where major discrepancies are identified, will provide the Board of<br/>Education with recommendations for reducing discrepancies. Team teaching, equalization<br/>of class sizes, number of preparations, and other alternatives shall be explored when major<br/>discrepancies are identified. The Association shall recognize that differences will exist<br/>among grade levels, subjects taught, course objectives, and number of students with<br/>learning problems when reasonable class sizes are established.</p>
<p>14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the establishment of class schedules at the secondary level and the grade level<br/>compositions at the elementary level, the site administrator will consult with the<br/>department chairpersons or elementary representatives selected by the elementary staff<br/>members. Such consultation shall involve reviewing means by which the class sizes can be<br/>made equitable.</p>
<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enhance the educational atmosphere of the classroom, to provide safe classroom<br/>conditions, and to attempt to equalize the workload among teachers, students within each<br/>school will be encouraged to enroll in classes with lower enrollments consistent with each<br/>student's educational program to attempt to equalize enrollment among sections.</p>
<p>14.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the unit having a teaching load which is disproportionate to teaching loads<br/>and responsibilities of other teachers of the same type or grade level, may request that a<br/>standing committee investigate the situation and make recommendations to the<br/>Superintendent in an attempt to resolve the problem. Such committee shall be composed of<br/>three (3) members appointed by the Association and three (3) members appointed by the<br/>Superintendent or designee.</p>

<p>64</p>
<p>placement, the special needs of the pupil, and the proposed duration of the<br/>placement.</p>
<p>(b) In addition, if the handicapped pupil is to be mainstreamed for more than one-half<br/>of the normal instructional time, the regular classroom teacher will be allowed to<br/>count said pupil as full-time for purposes of teaching-load problems as set forth in<br/>Section 14.3 above; and, furthermore, said teacher will be immediately eligible for<br/>assistance from the special education teacher who is primarily responsible for the<br/>pupil.</p>

<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those English classes where a major student expectation is writing<br/>composition, the District will make a good faith effort not to exceed 155<br/>pupils per day for each full-time teacher. Assignments for fewer than<br/>five (5) periods per day will be prorated.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers of secondary classes identified as “basic classes” shall be given<br/>an additional 20% credit for each child enrolled in such classes for<br/>purposes of this article (i.e., students in basic classes shall be counted as</p>

<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of and the schedule of the regular workday for each unit member shall be established by the<br/>District. If there is a break in continuous service, such time shall not be computed as time worked. For<br/>pay purposes, time worked shall be computed to the nearest quarter-hour. No unit member shall be<br/>required to work more than 8 hours in Home and Hospital or Independent Study in any workday.</p>
<p>6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home and Hospital Teachers’ work will begin at the site of the day’s first assignment or the<br/>Home and Hospital Office if receiving a new student assignment. Thereafter, travel time<br/>begins at the site of the first student of the workday. Time worked shall include travel time<br/>from student site to student site. For the purposes of computing mileage, the Home and<br/>Hospital Office will be used as a daily starting point.</p>
<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included within the FTE assignment of a Home and Hospital teacher will be a total of fourteen<br/>hours annually for participation in staff development activities and staff meetings. Such<br/>assignments shall be provided to allow teachers to attend four (4) two-hour staff meetings<br/>annually with the remaining hours for participation in district or county-office sponsored in-<br/>service training programs as approved by the programs as approved by the program<br/>administrator. When possible, teachers shall reschedule students for instruction when staff<br/>meetings and staff development activities conflict with the student’s normally scheduled<br/>instruction time.</p>
<p>6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Study teachers will be scheduled for one (1) staff development in-service training<br/>day prior to the commencement of the fall instructional program.</p>

Employees shall<br/>remain on the reinstatement list as provided by law. Employees on the list shall be offered vacant<br/>positions for which they are qualified and credentialed. The vacant position shall be offered to the most<br/>senior qualified and credentialed employee first, and then the next senior qualified and credentialed<br/>until the list is exhausted. The vacant position will not be opened for outside applications until the list<br/>is exhausted. An employee’s name shall be removed from the list if that employee declines an offer<br/>more than once without reasonable cause (e.g. illness, illness in the family, or other situation of similar<br/>magnitude). The unit member whose hours have been reduced or who has been laid off shall not be<br/>removed from the re-employment list if he or she accepts or refuses to accept a position with fewer<br/>hours than those worked prior to reduction.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff/administration meetings may be scheduled by the District and held for Independent Study, and<br/>Home and Hospital unit members. Staff meetings shall not be scheduled during regularly-scheduled<br/>holidays nor on non-paid days. The administrator shall notify teachers ten (10) days prior to scheduled<br/>staff meetings. Time allocated for such meetings shall be included within the FTE assignment.</p>
