<p>ARTICLE 8 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions.</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by one (1) or more unit members or the Association that<br/>there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision of<br/>the Agreement.</p>
<p>8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;grievant&quot; is the unit member, unit members, or the Association making the<br/>claim.</p>
<p>8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;party in interest&quot; is any person who might be required to take action or against<br/>whom action might be taken in order to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>8.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;work day&quot; is any day in which any unit member is required by contract to<br/>render service.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to the problems which may from time to time arise affecting the<br/>welfare or working conditions of unit members and the Association. Both parties agree<br/>that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at<br/>any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines.</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeline To Initiate Grievance:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member, or Association acting on</p>
<p>behalf of unit member(s), shall initially file any grievance not later than twenty<br/>(20) work days after the affected person or Association knew or could reasonably<br/>have been expected to know of the action or inaction that constitutes the basis for<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeline To Appeal At Each Level: An appeal to any subsequent level of the<br/>grievance procedure shall be filed in writing within five (5) work days after<br/>receipt of a written response or within ten (10) work days from the date of<br/>presentation of the grievance at the previous level if no response was given unless<br/>the timelines have been mutually extended.</p>
<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day following receipt of the<br/>grievance appeal or written decision.</p>
<p>8.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time<br/>limits specified at each level should be considered the maximum and every effort<br/>should be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be<br/>extended in writing by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>8-1</p>
<p>8.3.5 In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through</p>

<p>15.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who misses a portion of the beginning of the day but less than<br/>thirty (30) minutes of instructional time will be given one excused emergency<br/>leave per school year as determined by the Principal. Subsequent days of lateness<br/>will result in one hour of salary deduction for each hour or portion thereof that a<br/>unit member is late or, if a unit member chooses, a deduction of one-half ('A) day<br/>of sick/personal leave (if unit member qualifies).</p>
<p>15 .2.5 If the site administrator finds it necessary to secure coverage due to a unit member<br/>missing work, the unit member must use a minimum of one-half ('A) day of leave<br/>time to cover the absence.</p>
<p>15.2.6 In addition to all sick leave entitlement a unit member may accumulate within the<br/>District, she/he shall also be entitled to all unused sick leave which may have<br/>been accumulated while employed in a position requiring certification<br/>qualifications in another California public school district.</p>
<p>15 .2.7 The District shall provide each unit member with an accounting of the number of<br/>days of sick leave she/he has accumulated, plus the number of days to which the<br/>unit member is entitled for the current school year. The District shall provide an<br/>accounting of such days to unit members by November 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>15.2.8 Upon exhaustion of all accumulated sick leave, a unit member who is absent<br/>because of illness or accident shall receive, for a period of up to five (5) school<br/>months, the difference between her/his pay and the amount actually paid to a<br/>substitute, or, if no substitute has been employed, the amount that would have<br/>been paid a substitute. At the end of the five (5) school month period, if the unit<br/>member is still unable to return to work, the unit member shall be placed on a<br/>twenty-four (24) month reemployment list if a probationary employee, or a thirty-<br/>nine (39) month reemployment list if a permanent employee. The leave available<br/>under this section shall be subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>15.2.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member’s absence due to illness or accident must be<br/>consecutive with the exhaustion of all accumulated leave; and</p>
<p>15.2.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall only be entitled to one five (5) school month period<br/>each school year; and</p>
<p>15.2.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to not more than one five (5) school<br/>month period for the same illness or accident as determined by the<br/>doctor.

<p>15.2.9 A unit member returning from an extended sick leave or industrial injury leave<br/>may be required to submit to an independent medical examination by a physician<br/>selected by the District to evaluate his/her capacity to perform the work of his/her<br/>assigned position. This requirement shall apply whenever the District provides<br/>written notice of its belief that the unit member may not be able to perform his/her<br/>normal work duties due to illness or injury. The District shall bear all expenses of<br/>the exam. The unit member may also supply his/her own medical evaluations to<br/>the District for consideration.</p>

<p>15.2.10.1A unit member may use sick leave as set forth in this Article for<br/>disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, or<br/>childbirth, and recovery therefrom. The length of such sick leave,<br/>including the date on which the leave is to begin and the date on which<br/>the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the unit member<br/>and her physician; however, the District may require verification of such<br/>information from the physician. The unit member shall provide as much<br/>advance notice of the leave request as the physician gives.</p>
<p>15.2.10.2At the end of pregnancy disability leave, a unit member may request up<br/>to an additional (12) twelve weeks of unpaid leave of Family Care and<br/>Medical Leave.</p>
<p>15.3 Family Care And Medical Leave.</p>
<p>15.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide a unit member, upon request, with Family Care and<br/>Medical Leave (hereafter Family Care Leave) in accordance with law<br/>(Government Code § 12945.2).</p>
<p>15.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid Leave.</p>
<p>15.3.2.1 Family Care Leave shall be unpaid. Such leave shall run concurrently<br/>with any paid leave the unit member may be eligible for (e g., sick leave,</p>
<p>15-3</p>
<p>personal necessity leave) except pregnancy disability leave (see<br/>section 15.2.8.1). A unit member who requests unpaid Family Care<br/>Leave shall use all paid leave that is relevant to the purpose of the<br/>absence (e g., sick leave, extended illness leave or personal necessity<br/>leave) until such leave is exhausted during the otherwise unpaid leave<br/>period.</p>
<p>15.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Care Leave shall entitle the unit member to continued accrual of<br/>any employee benefit programs (other than health insurance) to the same<br/>extent and under the same conditions as would apply to any other unpaid<br/>leave granted by the District.</p>
<p>15.3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Family Care Leave, the District shall maintain and pay for the<br/>unit member’s health benefit coverage at the same level and under the<br/>same conditions as coverage that would have been provided if the unit<br/>member had been continuously employed during the leave period. The<br/>District may recover the cost of health benefit coverage if the unit<br/>member fails to return after leave for reasons other than continuation,<br/>reoccurrence, or onset of a serious health condition, or other<br/>circumstances beyond the unit member’s control.</p>
<p>15.3.3 Eligibility.</p>
<p>15.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who has been employed for at least twelve (12)<br/>months and who has been in a paid status for at least 1,250 hours during<br/>the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding commencement of<br/>the leave is eligible for Family Care Leave.</p>
<p>15.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Care Leave may be used for any of the following purposes: (1)<br/>the birth of a child or care of a newborn of a unit member; (2) the<br/>adoption or foster care placement of a child with a unit member; (3)<br/>leave to care for a unit member’s child, parent or spouse who has a<br/>serious health condition; or (4) a serious health condition of the unit<br/>member that makes the unit member unable to perform the essential<br/>functions of her/his position. “Serious health condition” and other<br/>eligibility criteria are defined by law.</p>
<p>15.3.4 Duration.</p>
<p>15.3.4.1 A maximum of up to twelve (12) weeks’ leave may be granted during<br/>any consecutive twelve (12) month period preceding and including the<br/>period of requested leave. A “rolling” twelve (12) month period shall be<br/>used consistent with federal law. The period of leave shall commence<br/>with the first day of absence.</p>
<p>15-4</p>
<p>15.3.4.2 Leave under this Article may be taken intermittently or on a reduced<br/>work schedule only to care for the serious health condition of a child,<br/>parent or spouse of the unit member when medically necessary as<br/>determined by the health care provider of the person with the serious<br/>health condition. If the unit member takes leave on an intermittent or<br/>reduced work schedule, only the amount of leave actually taken may be<br/>counted toward the twelve (12) weeks of leave. During the period of<br/>leave, the District may temporarily transfer the unit member to another<br/>assignment with equal pay which better accommodates the unit<br/>member’s leave schedule and District operations.</p>
<p>15.3 .4.3 Leave taken for the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child does<br/>not have to be continuous, but must be completed within one (1) year of<br/>the birth, adoption or placement. The minimum duration of such leave<br/>is two (2) weeks, except the District shall grant two (2) requests for<br/>leave of less than two (2) weeks.</p>
<p>15.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return To Work.</p>
<p>15.3.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member returning from Family Care Leave shall be reinstated to<br/>the same or comparable position as held by the unit member at the<br/>commencement of the leave.</p>
<p>15.3.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who while on leave under this Article gives notice of<br/>resignation or retirement shall be deemed to have resigned or retired, as<br/>appropriate, on the next work day following expiration of the leave.</p>
<p>15.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures.</p>
<p>15.3.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the event necessitating Family Care Leave is foreseeable, the unit<br/>member shall provide at least thirty (30) calendar days’ advance notice<br/>before leave is to begin. If thirty (30) calendar days’ advance notice is<br/>not practicable, such as due to a medical emergency, notice shall be<br/>given as soon as possible.</p>
<p>15.3.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of leave taken pursuant to this Article shall include: the<br/>anticipated date of the start of the leave; the anticipated pattern of leave<br/>use if the unit member will not be absent continuously; whether the unit<br/>member will substitute other paid leave for leave under this Article and,<br/>if so, how much paid leave; and the anticipated date of return to<br/>continuous active service, if known to the unit member. The District<br/>shall respond to a leave request no later than ten (10) calendar days after<br/>receiving the request. Once given, approval shall be deemed retroactive<br/>to the date leave was requested to begin.</p>
<p>15-5</p>
<p>15.3.6.3 Medical certification from the health care provider of the individual<br/>requiring care shall be provided for any Family Care Leave including<br/>personal medical leave. The medical certification need not identify the<br/>serious health condition involved but shall contain: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the date the</p>
<p>condition commenced, if known; (2) the probable duration of the<br/>condition; (3) a statement that the condition warrants participation of the<br/>unit member to provide care; and (4) an estimate of the time which the<br/>unit member needs to provide care. Recertification shall be required if<br/>additional leave is requested after expiration of the leave period<br/>originally estimated. If the District has reason to doubt the validity of<br/>the medical certification provided, the District may require, at its own<br/>expense, that the unit member obtain the opinion of a second health care<br/>provider selected by the District. If the second opinion differs from the<br/>original certification, the District may require the opinion of a third<br/>health care provider.</p>
<p>15.3.7 Consistent With Law.</p>
<p>Leaves under this section shall be supplemented by provisions of federal law<br/>(29U.S.C. §§ 2601, et seq.) and state law (Government Code §§ 12945.1, et<br/>seq.) and implemented consistent with those laws.</p>

<p>15.4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is incapacitated, applications may be submitted to the<br/>Committee by the participant’s agent or member of the unit member’s<br/>family.</p>

<p>15.4.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member applying to withdraw or extend his/her withdrawal from<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank will be required to submit a doctor’s<br/>statement indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the probable<br/>length of absence from work. (See section 15.4.5.7.)</p>
<p>15.4.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which<br/>qualifies the unit member for workers’ compensation benefits unless the<br/>unit member has exhausted all workers’ compensation leave and her/his<br/>own sick leave.</p>
<p>15.4.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a<br/>withdrawal request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide<br/>days and the District is under no obligation to pay the participant any<br/>funds whatsoever. If the Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or<br/>an extension of withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the<br/>request, they shall notify the unit member in writing of the reason for the<br/>denial.</p>
<p>15.4.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any withdrawal shall become effective immediately upon the<br/>exhaustion of the unit member’s sick leave or following ten (10) duty<br/>days after the commencement of illness or disability if the unit member<br/>has no sick leave.

<p>15.4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank (C.L.B.) shall be administered by a joint<br/>Committee comprised of three (3) members appointed by the<br/>Association and three (3) members appointed by the District.</p>
<p>15.4.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall have the responsibility of receiving withdrawal<br/>requests; verifying the validity of requests; approving or denying the<br/>requests; and communicating its decisions in writing to the unit member<br/>participants, to the Association and to the District.</p>
<p>15.4.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the<br/>Bank. The Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests<br/>complying with the terms of this policy.</p>
<p>15.4.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications shall be reviewed and decisions of the committee reported<br/>to the applicant, in writing, within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of<br/>the application.</p>
<p>15.4.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall have the responsibility of maintaining the records of<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The Committee shall keep all records<br/>confidential and shall not disclose the nature of the illness except as is<br/>necessary to process the request for withdrawal and defend against any<br/>appeals of denials.</p>
<p>15.4.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By November 1 of each school year, the District shall notify the<br/>Committee of the following:</p>

If the<br/>Committee does not feel it has sufficient medical information, it will</p>
<p>request additional data be presented by the medical providers. Lack of<br/>adequate information will lead to a denial of the request.</p>
<p>15.4.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee may reasonably presume that the applicant for a<br/>draw may be eligible for a Disability Award or a Retirement under<br/>STRS or, if applicable. Social Security, the Committee may request that<br/>the unit member apply for disability or retirement. Failure of the unit<br/>member to submit a complete application, including medical information<br/>provided by the unit member’s physician, within twenty (20) calendar<br/>days of the request shall disqualify the unit member for further<br/>withdrawals. Any requests for additional medical information from<br/>STRS or Social Security shall be submitted by the unit member within<br/>ten (10) days or the unit member’s entitlement to Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank payments will cease. If denied benefits by STRS or Social<br/>Security, the applicant must appeal or entitlement to the Bank shall<br/>cease.</p>
<p>15.4.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C.L.B. Committee shall operate under the guidelines of “reasonable<br/>people” philosophy. The decisions of this Committee will be based on<br/>the medical information provided. The data provided by a properly<br/>licensed medical doctor will be considered to be accurate and unbiased.</p>
<p>15.4.5.lOThe C.L.B. Committee has the responsibility to make sure any day(s)<br/>withdrawn from the C.L.B. by a unit member are clearly covered by<br/>medical evidence and the timeline provided by the medical doctor.</p>
<p>15.4.5.llThe Committee shall keep all information it receives confidential unless<br/>the unit member puts in writing the desire to appeal the Committee’s<br/>decision. Upon receiving the written appeal, the Committee shall<br/>provide all information they considered to the District Superintendent<br/>who is the first level appeals officer.</p>
<p>15.4.5.12The District Superintendent has thirty (30) calendar days to review the<br/>appeal upon receipt and render a decision. The unit member and<br/>members of the C.L.B. Committee will be notified in writing of the<br/>decision.</p>
<p>15.4.5.13If the unit member is not satisfied with the decision of the<br/>Superintendent, he/she may elect to present the appeal in writing to the<br/>Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees has forty (40) calendar days to<br/>review the written appeal and render a decision which is final. The<br/>Secretary of the Board will notify in writing the unit member and the<br/>members of the Committee the status of the appeal.</p>
<p>15.4.5.14Any decisions of the Committee must be completed for a fiscal year<br/>before the end of that fiscal year which is June 30th.

<p>15.5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time when a unit member becomes a natural or adoptive parent.</p>
<p>15.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity leave may also be used for situations which compel the unit<br/>member to attend a serious matter during the work day, because the matter can<br/>neither be accomplished at any other time nor reasonably disregarded. Leave for<br/>this purpose is justified if a reasonable person would agree that the unit member<br/>was compelled to be absent for personal business, immediate family illness or<br/>other immediate family reasons which could not be addressed outside work time.</p>
<p>15.5.3.1 Absence for vacation, recreation, concerted activities (e.g., engaging in a<br/>strike, demonstration, picketing, lobbying, rally, march, campaign<br/>meeting), work stoppage, seeking employment, shopping, traveling,<br/>personal monetary gain is not considered personal necessity leave.<br/>Other similar absence which is not of an urgent nature and can be<br/>accomplished at other than work time does not qualify.</p>

Up to a<br/>total of four (4) personal business days may be taken in one (1) year if<br/>banked days are available, but not more than three (3) consecutive days<br/>may be taken during one absence.</p>
<p>15.5.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who has worked for the District for at least ten (10) years<br/>may bank one (1) personal business day in any year up to a total of three</p>

<p>15.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member using personal necessity leave shall provide advance notice in<br/>accordance with the general requirements for absences (section 15.1.5). A unit<br/>member using a personal day shall comply with the notice requirements of<br/>section 15.1.5, but may follow the requirements for unexpected absences if the<br/>absence was not planned in advance.</p>
<p>15.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the absence, the unit member shall submit a completed absence form to<br/>the principal or immediate supervisor within three (3) working days after return to<br/>duty.</p>
<p>15.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to seek verification of any absence(s) attributed to<br/>personal necessity leave when abuse is suspected and to enforce any misuse of<br/>leave under this section.</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave.</p>
<p>A unit member shall be granted leave of absence for the death of any member of the</p>
<p>immediate family without loss of pay or deduction from other leave benefits found in this</p>
<p>Article. This leave shall be for three (3) days, or five (5) days if travel of more than</p>
<p>300 miles one-way is required. Such days need not be taken in consecutive order.</p>
<p>15.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty/Witness Leave.</p>
<p>15-12</p>
<p>15.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be granted leave, without loss of pay, to appear in court as a<br/>witness, other than as a litigant, or to respond to an official order from duly<br/>authorized government agencies, or to serve as a juror.</p>
<p>15.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any compensation, less any mileage expenses, received for appearance as a<br/>witness or from serving as a juror under this section shall be endorsed over to the<br/>District so that the unit member's compensation for any days of absence for the<br/>above purposes shall not be in excess of, nor less than, her/his regular pay.</p>

<p>15.8.1 A unit member shall be entitled to industrial accident or illness leave in<br/>accordance with the provisions of this Article immediately upon employment with<br/>the District.</p>

<p>20.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any evaluation performed pursuant to this article which contains seven or more<br/>ratings of “unsatisfactory” or “needs improvement” in standards 1 through 5 of an<br/>employee’s performance evaluation requires that the certificated employee shall<br/>participate in the Peer Assistance and Review Program. Teachers with five or six<br/>“unsatisfactory” or “needs improvement” will be encouraged, but not mandated to<br/>participate in the program.</p>
<p>20.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governing board of each school district shall evaluate and assess certificated<br/>employee performance as it reasonably relates to:</p>

<p>20.2.22The parties understand that every possible subject matter competency may not be<br/>available within the corps of consulting teachers, and it shall occasionally be<br/>necessary to secure additional assistance to fully address identified deficiencies.<br/>In such cases, the consulting teacher shall maintain primary responsibility for the<br/>Assistance Plan, but may function more like a case carrier who assures the<br/>availability of appropriate resources.</p>
<p>20.2.23Nothing herein shall preclude the Board from examining information which it is<br/>entitled by law to review in connection with the evaluation of and/or decision to<br/>retain in employment, probationary or temporary certificated employees.</p>

<p>WORK YEAR INCLUDING STAFF DEVELOPMENT DAYS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated unit members will have a 186-day work year including:</p>
<p>180 instructional days;</p>
<p>3 staff development days which qualify for State funding;</p>
<p>2 parent/teacher conference days;</p>
<p>1 day for District-wide and site staff meetings.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agreed in 1999-2000 to eliminate one work day, which existed for room<br/>preparation. Teachers remain responsible for professional preparation of classrooms<br/>prior to the instructional year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated salary schedule was increased by 1%, effective July 1, 1999 in exchange<br/>for unit members providing two additional staff development days commencing in 1999-<br/>2000.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the State changes the funding model or daily rate paid to teachers under the staff<br/>development law in the future, the parties agree to re-negotiate the salary increase and<br/>work year established in this Agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a certificated unit member is absent from a scheduled staff development day, he/she is<br/>responsible to attend a pre-arranged “make up” staff development program set up by the<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum within 20 work days after the scheduled staff<br/>development day. If the unit member does not complete the staff development<br/>obligation, the unit member’s salary will be reduced by .5% for the year for each staff<br/>development day missed.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No job share will be considered for kindergarten, special day classes or other teaching<br/>areas where students need a higher level of consistency.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenure is required to be considered for a job share. This may be waived by mutual<br/>agreement between EUTA and the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration prefers there be no more than two job shares at a site. A maximum of<br/>three teams will be considered, at the principal’s discretion.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a maximum of one job sharing per grade level. Two at a grade level will be<br/>considered through the 2002-2003 school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years is the maximum duration of job sharing for a specific team. Job shares will<br/>be reviewed annually, as outlined in Article 19. After three years, the job sharing<br/>teachers must return to full-time, if there are positions available. The principal may<br/>consider extending the time beyond three years if there are no new applications at the<br/>grade level and at the site that need to be considered, utilizing the parameters of the<br/>regulation.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who have been job sharing for three or more years will have the opportunity to<br/>continue in their current job sharing status until the end of the 2002-2003 school year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a teacher has vacated a job share, he or she must teach full-time for at least two<br/>years before requesting to return to another job share, unless the teacher is willing to be<br/>considered for a job at another site where there is not a waiting list for job shares.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If job share opportunities are not available on a specific campus, requests can be made to<br/>the principal at another site, provided there is a job share opportunity available.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who work in part-time capacities involving more than one assignment will not<br/>be included in the job share program numbers on a specific site.</p>
