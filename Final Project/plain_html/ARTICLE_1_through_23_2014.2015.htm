<p>ARTICLE 15: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Section 15.1 - Definition. A grievance shall mean a written complaint by an employee or the Association<br/>that there has been an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a provision of this<br/>Agreement. Hereinafter, the term “grievant” shall include either the employee or the Association. Days,<br/>for the purposes of this Article, will mean regular school working days.</p>
<p>Section 15.2 - General Provisions.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every employee shall have the right to present grievances in accordance with these procedures<br/>with or without representation. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to prevent any<br/>individual employee from discussing a problem with an agent of the District and having it resolved<br/>without filing a grievance as provided herein.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the grievant to act within the prescribed time limits stated in this Article will act as a<br/>bar to any further appeal. The failure of the District to give a decision within the time limits shall<br/>permit the grievant to proceed to the next step. The time limits stated herein shall not apply<br/>between the end of the traditional school year and the beginning of the next traditional year when a<br/>grievant is on a traditional calendar or when the grievant is off track on a YRE calendar.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a unit member exercises the right to process a grievance without assistance from the<br/>Association, the District shall follow Government Code Section 3543.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearings and conferences under this procedure shall be conducted at a time and place which will<br/>afford an opportunity for all persons entitled to be present to attend and will be held, after the<br/>regular hours of instruction or during the non-teaching time of personnel involved. When such<br/>hearings and conferences are held at the request of the District during the regular workday, all<br/>employees whose presence is required shall be released without loss of pay for those hours they<br/>are required to attend such hearings or conferences. However, the District will not release without<br/>loss of pay more than one (1) representative per grievance.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any investigation or other handling or processing of a grievance by a grievant or the Association<br/>shall be conducted so as to result in no interference with, or interruption of, the instructional<br/>program.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of multiple grievances on the same issue or on similar issues, at Level II or following,<br/>the District may elect to hear or respond to only one grievance. The District shall then contact the<br/>Association and request that it prepare a Class Action Grievance. The District shall provide the<br/>Association with copies of all grievance forms thereunto pertaining and the Association shall</p>
<p>2014-2015 ACE Agreement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52</p>
<p>prepare a grievance for all concerned parties. The decision rendered shall be applicable to all<br/>claims on the same issue, arising from the same set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Section 15.3 ■ Levels</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level - Before filing a formal grievance, the grievant’s immediate supervisor shall meet<br/>with the grievant, or a representative of the Association as the grievant’s designee, within ten (10)<br/>days of the alleged grievable occurrence. Unit members must clearly state to the supervisor that<br/>the discussion relates to an informal grievance so that the nature and purpose of the discussion<br/>are understood by both parties. After the meeting has taken place, the grievant or the Association<br/>representative and the immediate supervisor shall sign and date the standard grievance form,<br/>indicating only that the informal meeting has taken place. The form shall specify the alleged<br/>contract violation before signatures are written. If the meeting does not resolve the issue, or the<br/>meeting does not take place within ten (10) working days, the grievance shall proceed to Level 1.<br/>If the grievant or Association do not attempt to meet with the immediate supervisor for an informal<br/>level meeting, then further appeal is barred as indicated in Section 15.2 (b) of this Article.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I - Any employee who has a grievance may reduce such a matter to writing, within fifteen<br/>(15) days after the employee has knowledge or reasonably should have knowledge of the event<br/>which caused the grievance and submit it to the immediate supervisor who shall meet with the<br/>employee and/or an Association representative in an attempt to resolve the matter. Such meeting<br/>and a response in writing by the District will be made within ten (10) days after submission of the<br/>grievance into Level I.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II - If the grievance is not resolved in Level I, a written notice of appeal to Level II shall be<br/>served to the District within ten (10) days following the disposition of the grievance in Level I. Such<br/>grievance shall be discussed at a meeting with the employee, an Association representative, and<br/>the Superintendent or designee, and/or whomever else the Superintendent elects to be present. If<br/>the designee met with the grievant at Level I, the Superintendent and/or a different designee shall<br/>meet with the grievant and their representative at Level II. Such meeting and response in writing<br/>by the District will be made within ten (10) days after submission of the grievance into Level II.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III - Mediation - If the grievance is not resolved in Level II, a written notice of appeal to Level<br/>III shall be served to the District within ten (10) days following the disposition of the grievance in<br/>Level II. The matter may be submitted to a mediator upon mutual agreement between the District<br/>and the grievant/Association. Such agreement shall be reached within ten (10) days. If no such</p>
<p>2014-2015 ACE Agreement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</p>
<p>agreement is reached within ten (10) days, the District or the grievant/Association may take the<br/>grievance to Level IV. If there is mutual agreement, a mediator, appointed by the State Conciliation<br/>Service, will hear both positions and render non-binding suggestions in the hope that a solution will<br/>result. At the close of the mediation session, if a settlement has not been achieved, the<br/>grievant/Association and the District representative shall state such in writing,</p>
<p>e. Level IV</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievance is not settled at Level III, or there is no mutual agreement to use<br/>Level III, the grievant shall have up to ten (10) days to notify the Association of the unit<br/>member’s request for arbitration. The Association shall within five (5) days notify the<br/>District in writing of the grievant’s request for arbitration. Should the Association choose to<br/>submit the grievance to binding arbitration, it shall notify the Superintendent of such<br/>decision within thirty (30) days of the date that the Association notified the District of the<br/>grievant’s request for arbitration.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District, within ten (10) days of the request, shall request the State Conciliation Service<br/>to supply a list of five (5) names of persons experienced in hearing grievances in public<br/>schools. The Association and the District shall attempt to agree on a binding arbitrator from<br/>this list within five (5) days upon its receipt. If no agreement can be reached, each party<br/>shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The remaining panel member<br/>shall be the binding arbitrator. The order of striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne equally by the<br/>District and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision, on the issue<br/>or issues submitted. If the parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the<br/>arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written grievance and the answers<br/>thereto at each step.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this<br/>Agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures of the District. The<br/>arbitrator’s decision must be limited to the specific issue or issues submitted, and based<br/>upon the arbitrator’s interpretation of meaning or application of the language of the<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written arguments,</p>
<p>2014 - 2015 ACE Agreement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54</p>
<p>the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties his findings and decisions, which shall be<br/>binding to the Board of Education, the unit members, and the Association<br/>Section 15.4 - Waivers.</p><h6>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any of the time limits set forth in this Article may be waived by written agreement between the<br/>Parties.</h6>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only permanent certificated employees may apply.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have reached the age of 55 years by the start of the semester in which work<br/>begins.</p>

<p>Section 18.1 Unit members who wish to retire prior to the age of 65 may receive health insurance<br/>assistance from the District. Participation in the program shall be on a voluntary basis on the part of the<br/>former employee. To be eligible to participate in the program the employee must:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be under the age of 65 and at least 55 years of age at the time of retirement. Any changes in the<br/>terms and conditions of eligibility and coverage applicable to participating employees shall also be<br/>applicable to the retiree and spouse.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have at least fifteen (15) years of continuous service in the school district at the time of retirement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit a letter of resignation for retirement by no later than February 15 of the year they plan to<br/>retire.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opt for the program in writing prior to retirement.</p>

<p>Section 18.3 Employees in this program are not eligible for employment under the terms of Article 17<br/>(Employment After Retirement Plan).</p>
<p>Section 18.4 Coverage for the employee and spouse will terminate the first day of the month in which the<br/>retired employee reaches their 65th birthday or when the employee becomes eligible for Medicare<br/>benefits, or at the end of a five (5) year period, whichever comes first.

<p>Section 18.7 Retired Unit Members. The District also agrees to permit unit members who have retired<br/>(up to age 65) to continue on the District hospitalization medical and dental plans in order that the unit<br/>member may continue at the established group rate for that member’s age classification.

<p>59</p>
<p>carrier. The retired unit member will be responsible for submitting payments for health plan premium<br/>coverage to the Business Office of the District on the time schedule established by the District.</p>
<p>Failure of the retired unit member to meet the established premium payment schedule will result in the<br/>retired unit member being terminated from the hospitalization/medical-dental plan.</p>

<p>members, on a temporary basis, for the purpose of making up instructional time.</p>
<p>Off-track unit members will not be required to attend any school functions unless they are employed under<br/>separate contract, i.e., intersession meetings.</p>
<p>If the unit member agrees to complete an extra pay for extra duty assignment and is required by the<br/>District to fulfill this assignment during that member’s off-track time, (such as spelling bee, science fair, or<br/>other paid duty), the District shall compensate the unit member at the contractual hourly extra duty<br/>assignment rate. The District shall determine the appropriate number of hours to be compensated.</p>
<p>Section 22.10 ■ Special Services. In meeting instructional needs for students’ special services during<br/>the Year-Round Education program, unit members shall be given first consideration.

(See Appendix II, Section A for current work year.)<br/>Selection shall be on a voluntary basis if all positions can be filled by that method. Otherwise,<br/>assignments will be made by the District.</p>
<p>Specialists, including nurses, psychologists, counselors, speech therapists, adaptive physical education<br/>teachers, Curriculum Program Specialists, and resource specialists may service multiple tracks throughout<br/>the year by volunteering for additional work days beyond the contractual limits.

<p>A unit member assigned to a YRE position shall be compensated on the same base salary schedule as a<br/>unit member assigned to a traditional calendar position. Advancement on the salary schedule shall be as<br/>provided in Appendix IB.</p>
<p>Unit members who work at the YRE sites shall not be adversely affected by the application of the<br/>standards of advancing on the salary schedule or obtaining years of service credit, as defined in Article 7<br/>of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>If a unit member transfers into or out of a YRE site and in the process changes his/her pay cycle, the<br/>District will make every reasonable effort to accommodate the unit member’s pay cycle to minimize<br/>interruption of regular pay warrants. The District shall not be required to advance salary pay to unit<br/>members unless a bond acceptable to the District is provided by the unit member. Over and under<br/>payments that occur in any fiscal year will be handled as quickly and equitably as possible, but not later<br/>than the end of the school year. The beginning date for seniority will be determined by first day of paid<br/>service.</p>
<p>Unit members on YRE shall receive twelve (12) pay warrants per school year.</p>

<p>Section 23.2 ■ Transfer Reassignment The District shall not deny any unit member serving in a special<br/>education assignment who has fulfilled all of their credential requirements the right to transfer or be<br/>reassigned to a vacant position, for which the unit member is qualified, due to the unit member possessing<br/>a special education credential.</p>
<p>Section 23.3 - Individual Education Programs (lEPs)</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation - Unit members who work directly with students on active lEPs shall be provided the<br/>opportunity to serve on the IEP team responsible for developing, reviewing, and/or revising such<br/>programs.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement - The placement of a Student with Special Needs in a main streamed, collaborative, or<br/>inclusion model, will be made when deemed appropriate by the IEP team.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution of lEPs - The District shall make every effort to provide the unit member(s) who<br/>has(ve) direct student contact with a copy of the IEP as soon as possible.</p>

Grades are based on the criteria established in<br/>the IEP. When a student receives instruction in the regular classroom while also receiving support<br/>from a special education teacher, the regular classroom teacher will work with that special<br/>education teacher to determine the appropriate grade for the student based on ability,<br/>achievement, and the differential standards that were applied. The grade will be the result of a<br/>collaborative effort of both instructors.</p>

Special education teachers shall also<br/>have equal access to curricular materials and technology. Curriculum materials include but are not limited</p>
