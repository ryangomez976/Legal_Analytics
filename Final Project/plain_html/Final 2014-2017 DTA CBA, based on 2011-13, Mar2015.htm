<p>ARTICLE VI</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a claim by a certificated employee, group of certificated employees, or by<br/>the Association upon the interpretations, meaning, or application of any of the provisions of<br/>the written Agreement. A grievance must be initiated within fifteen (15) days after the<br/>grievant knew of the event giving rise to the grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is the person, persons, or Association making the claim.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “party in interest” is the person or persons making the claim or any person who might be<br/>required to take action or against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to problems arising from the interpretation, meaning, or application of the<br/>Agreement. Both parties agree that these proceedings shall be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any member having a<br/>complaint to discuss the matter with an appropriate member of the Administration and to<br/>have the complaint adjusted without further intervention.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the timetable<br/>specified at each level should be considered as a maximum, and every effort should be made<br/>to expedite the process. The time limits specified may be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all the steps<br/>in the grievance procedure by the end of the school year and if left unresolved until the<br/>beginning of the following school year could result in harm to a party in interest, the time<br/>limits set forth herein may be reduced by mutual agreement so that procedure may be<br/>exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon after as is practical.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance to the</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>grievant within the specified time limit shall permit the grievant to proceed to the next step.<br/>Failure at any step in this procedure to appeal the grievance to the next step within the<br/>specified time shall be deemed evidence of forfeiture of the right to process the grievance to a<br/>higher level. If a question arises as to the arbitrability of a grievance, such questions shall be<br/>ruled on by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>D. Steps in the Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP ONE. The grievant shall first discuss the grievance with the appropriate principal or<br/>immediate supervisor, either directly or through the Association’s designated grievance<br/>representative, with the objective of resolving the matter informally.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP TWO. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at STEP<br/>ONE, the grievant shall file the grievance in writing with the principal and with the president<br/>of the Association within five (5) working days. Within five (5) working days after receipt of<br/>the written grievance by the principal, the principal shall again meet with the grievant, who<br/>may be accompanied by a representative of the Association, in an effort to resolve the matter.<br/>The principal shall render a decision in writing regarding the grievance within five (5)<br/>working days following this meeting. Copies of said decision shall be provided the grievant<br/>and the president of the Association.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEP THREE. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at STEP<br/>TWO, or if no written decision has been rendered five (5) working days after the grievant has<br/>first met with the principal, the grievant may file the grievance in writing simultaneously with<br/>the Superintendent and the Association president. Within five (5) working days after receipt<br/>of the written grievance by the Superintendent, the Superintendent shall meet with the<br/>grievant, who may be accompanied by a representative of the Association, in an effort to<br/>resolve the matter. The Superintendent shall within ten (10) working days following the<br/>meeting render a preliminary decision in writing to the grievant and to the president of the<br/>Association. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at STEP<br/>THREE, or if no written decision has been rendered within ten (10) working days after the<br/>grievant meets with the Superintendent, the grievant may, within ten (10) working days after a<br/>decision by the Superintendent or after failure to render a decision within the specified time</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>limit, request in writing that the Association submit the grievance to arbitration. The<br/>Association, by written notice to the Superintendent within fifteen (15) working days after<br/>receipt of the request from the grievant, may submit the grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>4. STEP FOUR. Within ten (10) working days after such written notice of submission to<br/>arbitration, the District and the Association shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator.<br/>Procedures used to secure the services of an arbitrator are the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request shall be made to the American Arbitration Association to submit a roster of<br/>eleven (11) persons qualified to function as arbitrator in the dispute in question.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall thereupon alternate in striking a name from the roster until one (1) name<br/>remains. The person whose name remains shall be the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be<br/>limited to the issues submitted, and no evidence shall be submitted to the arbitrator that<br/>had not been submitted at STEP THREE. The arbitrator’s ruling shall not add to nor<br/>subtract from the Agreement between the parties. The arbitrator cannot rule on (a) the<br/>termination of services of, or failure to reemploy, any unit member; or (b) any unit<br/>member’s evaluation, except procedural matters. The findings of the arbitrator shall be<br/>in writing and shall set forth his/her findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusion on the<br/>issues submitted. Only the District, the grievant, and the Association shall be provided<br/>copies of the arbitrator’s report. The arbitrator’s decision shall be binding on both<br/>parties. Cost of the arbitration shall be subject to the following:</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party shall bear the costs incurred by themselves.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing fee and the fee and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the<br/>District and the Association.</p>
<p>E. Rights of Teachers to Grieve and be Represented.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall<br/>be kept in a separate grievance file and shall not be placed in the personnel file of any of the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievant may be represented at all steps of the grievance procedure by himself or, at<br/>his/her option, by a representative.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association shall ensure any grievant, party in interest, or participant in</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>the grievance procedure freedom from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, and<br/>reprisals in representing an appeal with respect to a grievance.</p>
<p>F. Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits for action provided in each level shall begin the day following the receipt of the<br/>written grievance document by the parties in interest (e.g., if an event occurs on Monday then<br/>Tuesday is day one).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents shall be prepared jointly by the District and<br/>the Association and given appropriate distribution so as to facilitate operation of the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the administration at a<br/>level above the principal, the grievant shall submit such grievance in writing to the<br/>Superintendent and the Association directly, and the processing of such grievance shall be<br/>commenced at STEP THREE.</p>

Pursuant to such<br/>authorization, the District shall deduct one-tenth (1/10) of such dues from the regular salary check<br/>of the unit member each month for ten (10) months.</p>
<p>Deductions for unit members who sign such authorization after the commencement of the school<br/>year shall be appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year. Any unit<br/>member who is a member of the Association shall remain a member for the term of the Agreement<br/>subject to the provisions of Section C.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the MUHSDTA/CTA/NEA or who does not make<br/>application for membership within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of assigned<br/>duties within the bargaining unit shall become a member of the Association or pay to the<br/>Association a fee in an amount equal to unified membership dues and general assessments.<br/>Payments to the Association shall be made in one (1) lump-sum cash payment in the same manner<br/>as required for the payment of membership dues, unless, however, the unit member authorizes<br/>payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as provided in Paragraph 1 of this Article. In<br/>the event that a unit member does not pay such fee directly to the Association or does not<br/>authorize payment through payroll deduction as provided in Paragraph 1, the Association shall so<br/>inform the District, and the District shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as<br/>provided in Education Code Section 45061 and in the same manner as set forth in Paragraph 1 of<br/>this Article. There shall be no charge to the Association for such mandatory agency fee<br/>deductions. <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>11</p>
<p>C. 1.

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members hired after March 1980, whose traditional tenets or teachings include<br/>objections to joining or formally supporting employee organizations shall not be required to<br/>join or financially support MUHSDTA/CTA/NEA as a condition of employment, except that<br/>such unit member shall pay, in lieu of a service fee, sums equal to such service fee to one of<br/>the non-religious, non-labor organizations, charitable funds listed in C. 1 above. Verifiable<br/>evidence of membership in a religious body whose traditional tenets or teaching object to<br/>joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall be made on an annual basis to<br/>the District as specified in C. 1.</p>
<p>3.

Payment shall be in the form of receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the<br/>amount paid, date of payment, and to whom payment in lieu of the service fee has been made.<br/>All information as listed above shall be presented on or before thirty (30) days from the date<br/>of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit. The Association shall have<br/>the right of inspection in order to review said proof of payment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member making payments as set forth in Paragraphs C. 1 and C.2 above, and who</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement be used in his/her<br/>behalf, shall be responsible for paying the reasonable cost of using grievance or arbitration<br/>procedures.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to Paragraphs C. 1 and C.2 above,<br/>whether for membership dues or agency fee, the District agrees promptly to remit such monies to<br/>the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members for whom such deductions<br/>have been made, categorizing them as to membership or non-membership in the Association and<br/>indicating any changes in personnel from the list previously furnished. The Association agrees to<br/>refund to the District any amounts paid to the Association in error.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time certificated employees who are not eligible for health and welfare benefits provided by<br/>this Agreement are excluded from the provisions of this Article.</p>

<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether any such action or<br/>proceeding referred to in Paragraphs C.l and C.2 shall or shall not be compromised, resisted,<br/>defended, tried, or appealed.</p>

<p>CLASS SIZE AND COUNSELING LOAD</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desirability of limiting the number of students participating in a class or assigned to a<br/>counselor is recognized, as is the desirability of equalizing, as much as possible, the number of<br/>students assigned to the various classes within a subject area. The above factors are viewed as<br/>desirable both from an educational viewpoint and from the viewpoint of providing a good working<br/>environment for unit members. To that end, the policy of the District is to limit class size and to<br/>equalize class size to an extent consistent with sound educational principles and within the fiscal<br/>and physical capabilities of the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the number of students in a classroom exceeds:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of workstations that can be safely shared or shared without impairing the<br/>teaching and/or learning process.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of desks that can be safely fit into a classroom or fit into a classroom without<br/>impairing the teaching and/or learning process.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students that can be safely managed in a locker room or kept safe in a physical<br/>activity.</p>
<p>The unit members shall report the issues to their site administrator. The site administrator shall<br/>make a good faith effort to address the issue immediately. After receiving the notification, the site<br/>administrator or designee will respond to the reporting unit member acknowledging receipt of the<br/>report and indicating the proposed action and timeline for resolution.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVI</p>
<p>LEAVES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For absence occasioned by each death in the unit member’s immediate family, no deduction<br/>in pay shall be made until such absence exceeds three (3) days. If the bereavement<br/>necessitates one-way travel of at least 225 miles, no deduction in pay shall be made until such<br/>absence exceeds five (5) days. See Part C for regulations pertaining to extension of<br/>bereavement leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate family as used in this section means mother, father, grandchild, step-parent,<br/>grandmother, grandfather of the unit member, or the spouse of the unit member, and the son,<br/>step-son, son-in-law, daughter, step-daughter, daughter-in-law, or any relative living in the<br/>immediate household of the unit member.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are granted sick leave when they are compelled to be absent from regular duty<br/>because of accident, illness, quarantine, or temporary disability caused by childbirth.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave with full pay shall be granted on the basis of ten (10) days per year. For unit<br/>members whose regular annual contract requires service for longer than the regular school<br/>year, one (1) day for each added month of service shall be granted.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused sick leave shall be accumulated from year to year without limit or restriction.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated sick leave becomes available on the first required service day of the annual<br/>duty year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is absent because of illness, accident, or quarantine, not exceeding five</p>
<p>(5) calendar months, shall have deducted from his/her salary, for the days absent in excess of<br/>the unit member’s total accumulated sick leave, only the amount paid to the substitute<br/>teacher. If no substitute is employed, the amount which would have been paid to the<br/>substitute shall be deducted.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave for unit members on less-than-full-time duty shall be in the proportion as their<br/>employment is to full-time.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>7. The Superintendent or his/her designee may require a certificate from a regular, licensed<br/>physician verifying illness or temporary disability. Such verification shall be by the unit<br/>member’s physician. Such ruling shall not discriminate against evidence of treatment and the<br/>need therefore by the practice of the religion of any well-recognized church or denomination.</p>
<p>C. Personal Emergencies.</p>
<p>The Association and the District agree to increase the days of accumulated sick leave for personal</p>
<p>emergencies from seven (7) days which may be used aggregately in any school year for the</p>
<p>following purposes:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extension of bereavement leave stipulated in Part A of this Article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving his/her person or property, or the person or property of a member of<br/>his/her immediate family, as defined in Part A, of such emergency nature that the immediate<br/>presence of the employee is required during his/her work day.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in court as a litigant.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious or critical illness of a unit member’s immediate family, as defined in Part A, of such<br/>an emergency nature that the immediate presence of the unit member is required during<br/>his/her workday.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five (5) days of paternity leave.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Response to an official order from another governmental jurisdiction for reasons not brought<br/>about through the misconduct of the unit member, of such emergency nature that his/her<br/>presence is required during his/her regular working hours and no alternative meeting time<br/>during non-duty hours can be arranged.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other personal business or emergency at the employee’s discretion, not to exceed three (3)<br/>working days. (Advance notification required for non-emergency discretionary leave. In case<br/>of an emergency, unit members will contact the District as soon as practicable.) The<br/>Superintendent or designee may extend personal emergency leave beyond the seven days for<br/>catastrophic leave because of catastrophic illness or injury to a member of the immediate<br/>family. The definition of catastrophic for the purposes of this agreement is an illness or injury<br/>that is expected to incapacitate the employee’s immediate family member for an extended<br/>period of time, and which requires the employee to take time off from work for an extended</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>period of time to care for that family member, and taking time off from work creates a<br/>financial hardship for the employee.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a year when a unit member is chief officer or chief officer elect of a civic, nonsectarian,<br/>nonpolitical organization, such absence, not to exceed two (2) days a year, may be charged<br/>against sick leave if the Superintendent or his/her designee so authorizes and the unit member<br/>so requests.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious observance.</p>
<p>D. Industrial Accident and Illness.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member absent because of injury or illness which arises out of or in the course of<br/>his/her employment shall be allowed up to sixty (60) days of industrial accident or illness<br/>leave for the time during which he/she is receiving temporary disability benefits under the<br/>workmen’s compensation laws of this state. Such leave shall not be accumulated from year to<br/>year. Such leave shall commence on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall not be entitled to receive wages or salary from the District during any<br/>calendar month which, when added to the District’s temporary disability benefits, will exceed<br/>a full month’s salary.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leaves shall be reduced by one (1) day for each day of authorized<br/>absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the unit<br/>member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due him for the same illness or<br/>injury.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member shall be entitled<br/>to the benefits provided (by sick leave), and his/her absence shall be deemed to have<br/>commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, provided that<br/>if he/she continued to receive temporary disability indemnity, such would result in a payment<br/>to him of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the unit member shall endorse to the District the temporary<br/>disability indemnity checks received on account of his/her industrial accident or illness. The<br/>District, in turn, shall issue to the unit member appropriate salary warrants for payment of</p>
<p>his/her salary and shall deduct normal retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy disability leave is defined as any temporary disability caused by a pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom. Upon verification from a physician, an<br/>employee who is required to be absent from duty due to these conditions may utilize sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall be accorded the current year’s allotment of sick leave, plus<br/>accumulated sick leave, towards pregnancy disability leave. These days shall be working<br/>days. With physician verification, unit members may have up to a total of five additional<br/>calendar months under differential pay provisions.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences related to pregnancy, childbirth (including child rearing), or related conditions<br/>which do not qualify for pregnancy disability leave may qualify for Family Medical Leave<br/>under Paragraph L.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paternity leave shall be governed by provisions in Article XVI, section C, 5 and/or<br/>Paragraph L.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty or Official Witness.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon notification of jury duty, it is the obligation of the unit member to immediately inform<br/>his/her principal or supervisor.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members called for jury duty shall be released for such purpose and shall receive in<br/>wages for the period of absence in an amount which, when combined with his/her jury duty<br/>fee, shall total his/her regular salary.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is required to appear in response to an official order from another<br/>governmental jurisdiction or in court as an official witness, he/she shall be released and paid<br/>full wages for the required period. If the appearance is brought about by his/her misconduct,<br/>he/she shall pay the amount actually paid a substitute or what would be paid a substitute if<br/>none is procured.</p>

<p>(7) additional years of full-time, active certificated service.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent in military service while on leave from a certificated position, while not<br/>considered a break in continuity of service, shall not be counted in computing the seven (7)<br/>consecutive years.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each applicant who has been granted sabbatical leave shall file a written report with the</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Superintendent or his/her designee immediately upon returning to active teaching. The report<br/>shall include not only the program pursued (travel and/or study), but also shall contain an<br/>appraisal of professional value of the year’s activities and the manner in which the knowledge<br/>and experience may be applied for the benefit of the school and the pupils.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for a unit member on a full-year sabbatical leave shall be one-half (1/2) of the<br/>basic salary he/she would have received if he/she had continued in his/her regular service<br/>during such period. For a unit member granted a one-semester sabbatical leave, the<br/>compensation shall be three-fourths (3/4) the basic salary he/she would have received if<br/>he/she had continued in regular service during such period.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have been granted sabbatical leave shall follow the normal progression on<br/>the salary schedule in the same way as if they were on active teaching duty.</p>

<p>Below is a summary of current California law on domestic partner rights. You will see that some of the</p>
<p>law cited becomes operative at the beginning of 2005.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic Partnership Defined. Domestic partners are two adults who have chosen to share one<br/>another’s lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring. (Family Code Section<br/>297(a), operative until January 1, 2005.)</p>
<p>A domestic partnership is established when the following nine elements are present: (1) both<br/>persons have a common residence; (2) both persons agree to be jointly responsible for each<br/>other’s basic living expenses incurred during the domestic partnership; (3) neither person is<br/>married or a member of another domestic partnership; (4) the two persons are not related by blood<br/>in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in this state; (5) both persons<br/>are at least 18 years of age; (6) either both persons are members of the same sex or one or both<br/>persons meet the eligibility criteria under Title II of the Social Security Act or Title XVI of the<br/>Social Security Act for aged individuals; (7) both persons are capable of consenting to the<br/>domestic partnership; (8) neither person has previously filed Declaration of Domestic Partnership,<br/>with the Secretary of State, that has not been terminated under Section 299; (9) both file a<br/>Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the Secretary of State. (Family Code Section 297(b),<br/>operative until January 1, 2005.) The code changes, with slight modifications to the above on<br/>January 1, 2005. Essentially the number of elements that must be satisfied is shortened to six.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic Partnership Rights. Family Code Section 297.5, operative January 1, 2005, provides<br/>registered domestic partners with the same rights, protections and benefits as spouses. Section</p>
<p>297.5 also subjects domestic partners to the same responsibilities, obligations and duties as<br/>spouses. This applies also to former registered domestic partners, surviving registered domestic<br/>partners and domestic partners with respect to a child of either of the partners. Further, registered<br/>domestic partners have the same rights regarding nondiscrimination as those provided to spouses.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic Partnerships Valid in Other Jurisdictions. Family Code Section 299.2, operative<br/>January 1, 2005, provides that domestic partnerships valid in another jurisdiction and that is<br/>substantially equivalent to a domestic partnership as recognized by California, will be recognized<br/>in California.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Members to Include Domestic Partners. Gov. Code Section 22871 sets forth numerous<br/>code provisions where a domestic partner shall be included in the definition of a family member.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Coverage. An employer may offer health benefits to the domestic partners of its<br/>employees and annuitants. A domestic partner and the child of a domestic partner are eligible for<br/>continued health coverage through PERS upon the death of the employee if the domestic partner<br/>receives a beneficiary allowance.</p>
<p>VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Health Care Plans/Disability Insurance Policies. Group health care plans and disability<br/>insurance policies that offer hospital, medical, or surgical expense benefits to employees for their<br/>dependents, must offer the same coverage to domestic partners. (Ins. Section 10121.7)</p>
<p>VII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave. An employer must allow employees to use sick leave for the illness of a domestic<br/>partner or a child of a domestic partner. (Labor Code Section 233)</p>
<p>VIII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment Benefits. A domestic partner who moves with his/her domestic partner outside<br/>of commuting distance from his/her present employment and who cannot transfer jobs, may<br/>receive unemployment benefits.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All personal items of value to teachers should be removed from the classroom for</p>
<p>safekeeping. Items located under six (6) feet on the wall should be removed ONLY if<br/>requested by site administration for scheduled deep cleaning of the classroom walls.</p>
<p>The District is not responsible for damage or loss to any items left in the classroom<br/>during the summer months.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove any personal window coverings (other than blinds installed by the District).</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tag damaged student desks to identify them for replacement</p>
<p>Teachers may voluntarily turn in keys upon checkout. Teachers who choose to keep (heir keys<br/>must return them upon request of a site administrator if there is a need for them during the<br/>summer months. The schools will be shut down as much as possible during the summer months<br/>in order to conserve energy. If you need to be in the classroom, contact your site principal to<br/>make arrangements even if you have your keys, The summer shut-down will end July 23, 2012.</p>

<p>The Merced Union High School District and Merced Union High School District Teachers<br/>Association enter into this Tentative Agreement to resolve negotiations for 2012-2013 as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall be furloughed for two (2) non-instructional work days (based on a<br/>184 day work year @ .54% salary per day). In no event shall a furlough day be scheduled prior<br/>to December 1<sup>st</sup> 2012.</p>
<p>Furlough days shall be restored based on the occurrence of the following contingencies:<br/>1.2012-2013:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Merced Union High School District 2012-2013 Funded Base Revenue Limit (BRL) per unit<br/>of ADA is reduced by $100.99 from the 2012-2013 adopted state budget Base Revenue Limit per<br/>ADA, 2 furlough days shall be restored.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District 2012-2013 Funded Base Revenue Limit (BRL) per unit of ADA is reduced by<br/>$101.00-$ 165.99 from the 2012-2013 adopted state budget Base Revenue Limit per ADA, 1<br/>furlough day shall be restored.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District 2012-2013 Funded Base Revenue Limit (BRL) per unit of ADA is reduced by<br/>$166.00 or more from the 2012-2013 adopted state budget Base Revenue Limit per ADA, no<br/>furlough days shall be restored.</p>

<p>“Funded Base Revenue Limit (BRL) per unit of ADA” as used herein refers to the District’s<br/>actual unrestricted ongoing funded base revenue limit per unit of average daily student attendance<br/>x P-2 ADA, after all deficit factors have been applied, including but not limited to, deficit<br/>reduction, equalization, and any other ongoing unrestricted changes to state school funding units<br/>of ADA including specially funded programs such as CSR. This language anticipates that the<br/>State school finance system remains as prescribed in current law. If there is a significant change<br/>in State school finance law, the parties agree to re-open this agreement for the purpose of<br/>modifying the provisions.</p>
<p>These proposed furlough days will be offset by new additional revenue, whether ongoing or one<br/>time, received by the district, such as but not limited to: federal funds, state and local revenues<br/>(e.g. city or county revenues), etc. which can be used without restriction for general fond<br/>purposes or with restrictions but which free up equivalent amounts of general fond monies<br/>previously budgeted. This is revenue that did not exist or was not available at the time this<br/>agreement was ratified by the parties. For example: if base revenue limit was reduced by $180.00<br/>which would approximate the need to take two (2) furlough days, and additional new revenue<br/>was received by the district in the equivalent of $20.00 per ADA on the base revenue limit, the</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>TENTATIVE AGREEMENT - 8-3-12</p>
<p>result would be a net base revenue limit reduction of $20.00 equating to one (1) furlough day;<br/>one (1) furlough would be restored. Salary reduction due to furlough day(s) will be divided<br/>evenly by months December, 2012 through June, 2013. Any furlough days and commensurate<br/>salary reductions implemented for the 2012 -2013 school year shall terminate June 30,2013; the<br/>remainder of this Memorandum of Understanding terminates as of June 30,2015.</p>

<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All aspects of Grant implementation which are within the scope of bargaining within the<br/>meaning of the Education Employee Relations Act (EERA) will be determined through<br/>collective bargaining. By example, consistent with the EERA the following subjects shall be<br/>subject to negotiation:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All procedures related to teacher evaluation, including any survey instruments used in<br/>connection with the teacher evaluation process as well as the selection and application of<br/>any student performance indicators used to measure student growth for use in teacher<br/>evaluations.</p>
