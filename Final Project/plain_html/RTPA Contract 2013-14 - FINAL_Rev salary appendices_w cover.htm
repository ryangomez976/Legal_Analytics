<p>V - 2</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>1. Definitions</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance is a claim by an employee, group of employees, or the Association,<br/>based on an alleged violation of this negotiated contract by the District.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant is one or more employees making the claim.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Party in Interest is any person who might be required to take action, or against<br/>whom action might be taken, in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate Supervisor is the principal or supervisor having immediate jurisdiction<br/>over the employee filing the grievance, who has authority to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative<br/>level, equitable solutions to claims that there have been violations or<br/>misinterpretations of a provision of this Agreement. Both parties agree that these<br/>proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any<br/>level of the procedure.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time<br/>specified at each level should be considered to be maximums, and every effort<br/>should be made to expedite the process as soon as practical. The time limits may,<br/>however, be extended by mutual agreement. Time limits provided in Levels Two,<br/>Three, and Four shall begin on the grievant’s first work day following receipt, by<br/>personal delivery or certified mail, of written decisions by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>(a) Level One - Informal Resolution</p>
<p>The grievant shall first discuss the grievance with his/her immediate supervisor<br/>within eight (8) working days of when he/she knew, or should have known, of the<br/>circumstances which form the basis for the grievance. Both parties shall seek to<br/>resolve the matter informally. Beginning with Level One, the grievant and the<br/>administrators shall have the right to be accompanied by a representative of their<br/>choice. If a grievant is not represented by the Association, the District shall<br/>simultaneously provide a copy of the decisions beyond Level One to the<br/>Association President. <sup>VI-</sup></p>
<p>VI- 1</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two - Formal Resolution</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at<br/>Level One, or if no decision has been rendered within eight working days<br/>after discussion of the grievance, he/she may file a written grievance with<br/>his/her immediate supervisor on a form provided by the District. (See<br/>Appendix “F ”) The grievant will submit a copy of the written grievance<br/>to the Association President.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within eight (8) working days after receipt of a written grievance, the<br/>immediate supervisor will meet with the grievant in an effort to resolve the<br/>grievance. The immediate supervisor shall submit his/her written decision<br/>to the grievant within eight (8) working days after the meeting.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level Two, or if no decision is<br/>rendered within eight (8) working days, the grievant may appeal the decision, in<br/>writing, to the Superintendent or designee within eight (8) working days. The<br/>Superintendent will meet with the grievant and/or his/her representative if<br/>requested by the grievant or the Superintendent before making a decision. The<br/>Superintendent shall provide a written decision, including the reason therefore,<br/>within ten (10) working days of the appeal. If a meeting is requested, the timeline<br/>shall be extended by five (5) working days.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Four</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at Level<br/>Three, or if no written decision has been rendered within the Level Three<br/>timelines, the Association may, with notice to the Superintendent or designee,<br/>contact the State Mediation and Conciliation Service to request the services of a<br/>mediator to assist in the resolution of the grievance. The parties shall meet with<br/>the mediator at times that are mutually convenient. A mutually acceptable<br/>mediated settlement shall be binding on both parties. In no event shall the<br/>Mediator issue any recommended terms of settlement.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Five</p>
<p>1) If an acceptable mediated settlement is not reached between the parties at<br/>Level Four, the Association may, within eight (8) working days of when<br/>the parties determined to discontinue mediation efforts, and with notice to<br/>the Superintendent, submit the grievance to Arbitration.</p>
<p>VI-2</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall attempt to select a mutually acceptable arbitrator. Should<br/>they be unable to agree on an arbitrator within eight (8) working days of<br/>the Association’s notice to the Superintendent that it intends to submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration, submission of the grievance shall be made to the<br/>American Arbitration Association. In either event, the parties shall be<br/>bound by the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration<br/>Association in the selection of an arbitrator and the arbitrator shall proceed<br/>under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the AAA.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to, per<br/>diem, expenses, his/her travel and subsistence expenses, the cost of any<br/>hearing room, the cost of the court reporter if requested by the Arbitrator,<br/>will be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other costs<br/>will be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>4) The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding on both parties.</p>
<p>4. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time without loss of pay to attend a grievance meeting or hearing shall be<br/>provided to all grievants, grievance representatives and witnesses involved in the<br/>grievance. Any employee whose appearance is necessary in such investigations<br/>may be released. These activities will be held on school days, after school hours,<br/>or whenever possible. In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot<br/>be processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the<br/>school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school<br/>year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein<br/>may be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the<br/>school year or as soon as practicable. In the event a grievance is submitted fifteen<br/>(15) or fewer work days before a vacation and a decision is not reached before<br/>said vacation, then the aggrieved person shall state his/her preference in writing,<br/>whether the grievance will be continued through vacation or delayed until after<br/>vacation.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the<br/>personnel file of any of the participants.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents, will be provided by the<br/>Superintendent. If, in the judgment of the Association, a grievance affects a group<br/>or class of employees, the Association may initiate and submit such grievance in<br/>writing to the Superintendent directly and the processing of such grievance will be<br/>commenced at Level Three. The Association may process such grievance even</p>
<p>VI-3</p>
<p>though there is no individual aggrieved person who wishes to do so. See sample<br/>grievance forms under Appendix “F ”</p>
<p>5. Authority</p>
<p>The Arbitrator shall have no power to add to, to subtract from, or to change any of the<br/>terms or provisions of this Agreement. Jurisdiction shall extend solely to claims of<br/>violations of specific written provisions of the Agreement and involve only the<br/>interpretation and application of the Agreement.</p>
<p>VI-4</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who have completed 1250 hours of service during the previous one<br/>calendar-year period and have completed a total of twelve months of service with<br/>the District have the right to request an unpaid leave of absence for up to twelve<br/>work weeks within a twelve-month period for the purpose of caring for a new<br/>baby, a newly-adopted child, or a newly-placed foster child or for a child, spouse,<br/>parent, or the employee with a serious health condition.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health insurance coverage shall be maintained and paid for by the District for the<br/>duration of the leave not to exceed twelve work weeks in a twelve-month period.<br/>Beyond the twelve work weeks, the employee may continue his/her coverage by<br/>payment of the necessary premiums on a monthly basis. The District may recover<br/>the premium paid for the employee during the leave if the employee fails to return<br/>from leave after the period of leave has expired for a reason other than the<br/>continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that entitles the<br/>employee to leave of absence or other circumstances beyond the control of the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no carry-over of unused leave; federal/state Family Care Leave does not<br/>accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Parent” means a biological, foster or adoptive parent, a stepparent, a legal<br/>guardian, or other person who stood in loco parentis to the employee when<br/>the employee was a child.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Child” means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal<br/>ward, or a child of an employee standing in loco parentis who is either<br/>under 18 years of age or is an adult dependent child who is incapable of<br/>self-care because of a mental or physical disability.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Serious health condition” means illness, injury, impairment, or physical<br/>or mental condition of the employee or a child, parent or spouse of the<br/>employee that involves either (1) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or<br/>residential health care facility; or (2) continuing treatment or supervision<br/>by a health-care provider.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both parents of a child who are entitled to Family Care Leave under the first<br/>paragraph (a) above are employees of the District, the District shall not be<br/>required to grant leave in connection with the birth, adoption, or foster care of a<br/>child that would allow the parents Family Care Leave totaling more than a<br/>combined total of twelve work weeks specified in paragraph (a).</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall provide reasonable advance notice to the District of the need<br/>for Family Care Leave, the reason the leave is needed, the date the leave will</p>
<p>commence, and the estimated duration of the leave. If the need for a leave<br/>becomes known more than thirty calendar days prior to the date a leave is to<br/>begin, the employee must provide at least thirty calendar days written advance<br/>notice.</p>

<p>(h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority protection - Family Care Leave does not constitute a break in service for<br/>seniority under the bargaining agreement or District employee benefit plan.</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Care Leave is an unpaid leave of absence unless an employee elects to use<br/>appropriate paid leave set forth in this Agreement. When available paid leave is<br/>exhausted, the balance of the Family Care Leave, if any, is unpaid. Any paid or<br/>unpaid leave entitled to be taken and taken for a reason that would also entitle the<br/>employee to federal and state Family Care Leave shall be designated also as<br/>federal/state Family Care Leave and counted against the employee’s federal/state<br/>Family Care Leave entitlement.</p>
<p>(j) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon return from a federal/state Family Care Leave, an employee is entitled to<br/>return to the same position or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits,<br/>pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, including the same work site<br/>(if available). However, the employee has no right to return to the same position<br/>if it is no longer available. The determination of whether a position is equivalent<br/>shall be based on established District policies and the collective bargaining<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>(k) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent not specifically covered in paragraph (a) through (j), above,<br/>federal/state Family Care Leave shall be governed by the minimum employee and<br/>employer rights contained in the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (29<br/>U.S.C. Sections 2601 et seq.) and the California Family Rights Act (Cal.<br/>Government Code Section 12945.2).</p>

<p>All employees may take up to twelve months unpaid leave following the birth or adoption<br/>of a child. (E.E.O.C. Title VII)</p>
<p>17. Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation and Purpose</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to create a Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>(“Bank”) effective January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank will permit employees of the District to donate eligible leave<br/>credits to an employee when that employee or a member of his/her family<br/>suffers a catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness or injury” is defined as an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time or<br/>that incapacitates a member of the employee’s family which incapacity<br/>requires the employee to take time off from work for an extended period of<br/>time to care for that family member and taking extended time off work<br/>creates a financial hardship for the employee because he/she has exhausted<br/>all his/her sick leave, and other paid time off, excluding differential leave.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Employee’s family” is defined as husband, wife, son, or daughter of the<br/>employee or stepchildren of the employee.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Bank shall accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank<br/>without regard to the daily rate of pay of the Bank participant.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank shall be administered by a Joint Committee (“Committee”) of<br/>two members appointed by the Association President and two members<br/>appointed by the District.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>1) All employees on active duty with the District are eligible to contribute to<br/>the Bank. <sup>IX-</sup></p>
<p>IX- 10</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires contribution to the Bank. Only<br/>contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who elect not to join the Bank upon first becoming eligible<br/>must wait until the next date of assessed contribution and then must<br/>contribute at least two days of sick leave or the actual assessment,<br/>whichever is greater.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution, on the appropriate form, must be authorized by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation occurs automatically whenever an employee fails to make<br/>his/her contribution or assessment. Cancellation, on the proper form, may<br/>be effected at any time, and the an employee shall not be eligible to draw<br/>from the Bank as of the effective date of cancellation. Sick leave<br/>previously authorized for contribution to the Bank shall not be returned if<br/>an employee effects cancellation.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall initially be made between November 1 and January 1<br/>for the 1996/97 school year. Employees returning from extended leave<br/>which included the enrollment period and new hirees will be permitted to<br/>contribute within thirty calendar days of beginning work. The District<br/>shall supply enrollment forms for the Bank to all new and those employees<br/>returning from leave.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees wishing to participate in the Bank shall make an initial<br/>contribution of two days the first year of participation. Part-time<br/>employees will have their contribution prorated.</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may require, at any time, an additional day or days of<br/>assessed contribution of participants if the number of days in the Bank<br/>falls below a level to be determined by the Committee. Bank participants<br/>who are drawing from the Bank at the time of the assessment will not be<br/>required to contribute to remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a Bank<br/>participant has no remaining sick leave at the time of the assessment,<br/>he/she need not contribute the additional day(s) to remain a participant in<br/>the Bank. However, upon the next District allocation of yearly leave to<br/>that Bank Participant, that Bank Participant will repay whatever<br/>assessment was previously made but not contributed to the Bank by that<br/>Bank Participant. <sup>IX-</sup></p>
<p>IX- 11</p>
<p>(c) Withdrawal From the Bank</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank participants who have exhausted all paid leaves, excluding<br/>differential leave, may withdraw from the Bank for catastrophic illness or<br/>injury.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants who have exhausted sick leave, but still have differential leave<br/>available, are eligible for a withdrawal from the Bank. The District shall<br/>pay the participant no more than a full day’s pay. The Bank shall be<br/>charged no more than a full day’s pay regardless of the differential leave<br/>award.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten work days of illness or disability must be covered by the<br/>participant’s own sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay the<br/>first time the participant qualifies for a withdrawal draw from the Bank.<br/>For subsequent withdrawals within twelve consecutive months for any<br/>unrelated catastrophic illness, the first five duty days of illness must be<br/>covered by the participant’s own sick leave, differential leave, or leave<br/>without pay.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant is incapacitated, applications may be submitted to the<br/>Committee by the participant’s agent or member of the participant’s<br/>family.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Bank shall be granted in units of no more than thirty<br/>working days. Participants may submit requests for extensions of<br/>withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A participant’s withdrawal from<br/>the Bank may not exceed ninety work days within a school calendar year.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the<br/>Bank are required to submit a physician’s statement indicating the nature<br/>of the illness or injury and the probable length of needed absence from<br/>work. Members of the Committee shall keep information regarding the<br/>nature of the illness confidential.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any participant applying to the Bank or requesting an extension of<br/>withdrawal, the Committee may require a medical review by a physician<br/>of the Committee’s choice at the participant’s expense. The Committee<br/>shall choose only a physician who qualifies under the District insurance<br/>policy. Refusal to submit to the medical review will terminate the<br/>participant’s eligibility to withdraw from the Bank. The Committee may<br/>deny an initial application or extension of withdrawal from the Bank based<br/>upon failure to comply with terms and conditions outlined in Article IX,<br/>Section 17. <sup>IX-</sup></p>
<p>IX- 12</p>
<p>8) Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which</p>
<p>qualifies the participant for Workers’ Compensation benefits unless the<br/>participant has exhausted all Workers’ Compensation leave, his/her own<br/>all paid leaves, excluding differential leave and provided further that the<br/>member signs over any Workers’ Compensation checks for temporary<br/>benefits to the District. If there are any Workers’ Compensation checks<br/>signed over to the District, the Bank will not be charged days, or if<br/>charged, will be reimbursed the number of days for which the Workers’<br/>Compensation payment is equivalent to a regular day of pay at the<br/>negotiated rate for that participant. “Regular day of pay” means the<br/>employee’s annual salary divided by the required number of days of<br/>service as set forth in the employee’s contractual work year. If the<br/>District challenges the Workers’ Compensation claim, the participant may<br/>draw from the Bank, but upon settlement of the claim, the Bank shall be<br/>reimbursed the days by the District.</p>
<p>9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee may reasonably presume that the applicant for a<br/>draw may be eligible for a private disability award, a disability retirement<br/>or disability allowance under STRS or, if applicable. Social Security, the<br/>Committee shall require that the applicant apply for such benefits. The<br/>applicant shall deliver a copy of such application to the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Human Resources. Failure of the applicant to submit a<br/>complete application, including medical information provided by the<br/>applicant’s physician, within twenty calendar days will disqualify the draw<br/>applicant from further Bank payments. Any requests for additional<br/>medical information from STRS, Social Security, or other benefit<br/>administrator shall be submitted within twenty-one days or the<br/>participant’s entitlement to Bank payments shall cease. If denied benefits<br/>by STRS, Social Security, or other benefit administrator, the applicant<br/>must appeal or entitlement to the Bank shall cease.</p>
<p>10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal request, the<br/>Committee is under no obligation to provide days and the District is under<br/>no obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If the<br/>Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension of withdrawal,<br/>because of insufficient days to fund the request, they shall notify the<br/>participant, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>11) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the exhaustion of<br/>sick leave, all other paid leaves, excluding differential leave and the<br/>waiting period provided for in Section (c)4), whichever is greater.</p>
<p>IX-13</p>
<p>(d) Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall have the responsibility of maintaining the records of<br/>the Bank, receiving withdrawal requests, verifying the validity of requests,<br/>approving or denying the requests, determining that a recipient or<br/>applicant is no longer eligible and communicating its decisions, in writing,<br/>to the participants.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals may not be denied on the basis of the type of illness or<br/>disability.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications shall be reviewed and decisions of the Committee reported to<br/>the applicant, in writing, within ten work days of receipt of the application.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose<br/>the nature of the illness except as is necessary to process the request for<br/>withdrawal and defend against any appeals of denials.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVII</p>
<p>SHARED CONTRACT FOR REDUCED WORKLOAD</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this program is to provide options for certificated employees who hold<br/>positions with salaries up to that of a school principal to share the responsibility of a full¬<br/>time position with another qualified certificated employee. The District agrees to offer<br/>shared contracts when authorized by the on-site principal. The employees involved must<br/>submit a written plan to their principal/supervisor. Upon approval of the plan by the<br/>principal/supervisor, the plan will be submitted to the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources for final consideration. At no time will the cost to the District amount to more<br/>than the cost of one full-time employee plus benefits. If the shared contract, in the<br/>opinion of the principal, does not succeed, the employees involved will be notified in<br/>writing and will revert to Options (a) or (b). Under this program, certificated employees<br/>may share a position by:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working half a day;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working one (1) semester or one point five (1.5) trimesters (split equally the<br/>remaining workdays);</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working alternate weeks;</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working a three (3) day/two (2) day split;</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working a two point five (2.5) day split week;</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees may, at their own option and subject to District approval, elect to<br/>share a contract for a full-time position under the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter of intent must be filed by March 15 indicating each employee’s desire to<br/>share a contract for a full-time position for the coming year.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter of resignation must be signed that the employee accepts a lesser<br/>percentage contract, and his/her seniority will be accrued at that lesser percentage<br/>of contract time.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum employment under this program shall be equal to one half of the<br/>number of contract days normally required of the full-time certificated employee.<br/>(This includes all preschool, postschool, inservice, and release days listed on the<br/>calendar.)</p><h3>xvn-1</h3>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new employee working half time will become tenured as a half-time employee<br/>after two (2) years.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee, except for those employed the second half of the contract year<br/>only, will receive one-half (1/2) salary which is to be paid on a monthly basis for<br/>twelve (12) months. Employees employed for the second half of the contract year<br/>only may receive one-half (1/2) salary on a monthly basis for twelve (12) months<br/>if they post a bond guaranteeing service to the District or receive their salary on a<br/>monthly basis for the months commencing when they start teaching the second<br/>half of the contract year.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee may receive all fringe benefits granted to personnel in his/her<br/>classification at a rate equal to one half that of a full-time employee if the<br/>employee contributes additional monies to purchase the full coverage.</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee and the District’s contribution to the retirement system will be<br/>based on an actual salary paid. The employee will receive only the pro-rated<br/>service credit toward years of service as computed by the employee’s retirement</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>(h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee will receive pro-rated credit for longevity advancement on the<br/>salary schedule.</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave benefits are accrued based on the pro-rated normal rate. Workers’<br/>Compensation insurance is based on the employee’s actual salary.</p>
<p>(j) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitutes</p>
<p>When an employee in the shared contract program uses a substitute, he/she must<br/>indicate which leave provision is being used, such as sick leave, personal<br/>necessity, or other leave. The person sharing the contract with the individual will,<br/>if he/she desires to do so, substitute for the partner. This will be done at the<br/>prevailing substitute pay rate; otherwise, a regular substitute will be employed.</p>
<p>(k) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both members of a team are responsible for information from staff or grade level<br/>meetings. One (1) member of the team will be required to attend these meetings<br/>and will be responsible for sharing all information with the team partner. Both are<br/>also responsible for taking an active part in District and school inservice, parent<br/>conferences, yard duty, and other duties as required. When additional time of<br/>service is required, then the half-time employee will be paid for the additional<br/>time at his/her regular rate of pay; otherwise, the employee will have the option of<br/>leaving when his/her usual time has been fulfilled. A calendar will be developed<br/>by the school site administrator specifying required work days for each team.</p><h3>xvn-2</h3>
<p>(l) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some flexibility may be allowed, scheduling is the responsibility of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>(m) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shared-contract teaching assignments shall be made only with the approval of<br/>the District.</p>
<p>(n) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments of shared-contract employees shall be made in the best interest of the<br/>District as finally determined by the District. Assignments will be made for a<br/>period not to exceed one (1) school year.</p>
<p>(o) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one partner does not continue for the full period of the assignment and no other<br/>suitable partner can be employed, the remaining partner may be assigned on a full¬<br/>time basis at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>(p) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a shared contract employee wishes to return to full-time teaching for the next<br/>school year, he/she must fill out a letter of intent by March 15. He/she will be<br/>offered the first available teaching position for which he/she is qualified and<br/>placed on the salary schedule on the basis of the accrued years and units earned.<br/>Accrued seniority within the District will also be maintained, and if more<br/>employees wish to return to full-time teaching than there are positions available,<br/>then assignments will be made on the basis of seniority, provided each is equally<br/>qualified for the position. If no full-time position is available, the employee will<br/>retain his/her shared-contract position.</p>

<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 2009, the salary schedule shall be increased by the funded<br/>increase in Base Revenue Limit per unit of average daily attendance between<br/>2008-2009 and 2009-2010 minus 1%. That percentage will be applied to all</p>
<p>2008- 2009 Certificated Salary schedules.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 2010, the salary schedule shall be increased by the funded<br/>increase in Base Revenue Limit per unit of average daily attendance between</p>
<p>2009- 2010 and 2010-2011 minus 1%. That percentage will be applied to all the<br/>2009-2010 Certificated Salary Schedules.</p>
<p>The formula used for salary for 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 does not establish a<br/>past practice and is not in effect after 2010-2011. In no event shall this formula<br/>reduce the current salary schedule.</p>

When the teacher’s aggregate over a<br/>two or more consecutive year period equals a full year’s credit, the teacher shall<br/>be given one year’s credit for purposes of initial salary schedule placement. When<br/>the teacher’s aggregate of equivalent teaching experience exceeds seventy-five<br/>percent (75%) but less than one hundred percent (100%) of a full teaching year,<br/>the teacher shall be given credit for one full year for purposes of initial salary<br/>schedule placement.</p>
<p>(c) Teachers who serve in less than full-time District positions shall be allowed to<br/>compute acquisition of a full year’s credit over a two or more consecutive year<br/>period.

<p>PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW PROGRAM</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Peer Assistance and Review Program (“PAR program” or “Program”) is hereby<br/>established as authorized by Article 4.5 of Chapter 3 of Part 25 of the Education Code,<br/>commencing at Section 44500.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PURPOSES OF THE PROGRAM</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Program is improvement of delivery of the District’s<br/>instructional programs through provision of peer assistance and review to any permanent<br/>teacher who:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receives a rating of less than “effective” on the summary evaluation (see factor G<br/>on the District’s Summary Evaluation Report); or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receives a rating of less than “effective” on any two or more of the five evaluation<br/>factors (factors A through E on the District’s Summary Evaluation Report); or</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voluntarily requests assistance to improve instructional performance. Unlike<br/>teachers under 1 and 2, above, a volunteer’s classroom performance shall not be<br/>subject to a written evaluation of the volunteer’s participation in the Program by a<br/>Support Provider/Consulting Teacher. A certificated administrator may at any<br/>time recommend to a teacher that he/she obtain the assistance and review of a<br/>Support Provider/Consulting Teacher.</p>
<p>[A teacher described under 1 or 2, above, shall be known as a “referred PAR participant.”<br/>A teacher described under 3, above, who has not been referred to the Program as<br/>described below shall be known as a “volunteer PAR participant.”]</p>
<p>The funds received from the State under the Peer Assistance and Review Program may<br/>also be expended for, and Support Provider/Consulting Teachers may be assigned for, any<br/>of the purposes described in subdivision (b) of Education Code §44506, including (1) the<br/>Marian Bergeson Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment System, (2) the California<br/>Pre-Internship Teaching Program, (3) a District intern program described in the Education<br/>Code at §§44325-44329, (4) professional development or other educational activities<br/>previously provided under the Mentor Teacher Program (described in the Education Code<br/>commencing at §44490); and any program that supports the training and development of<br/>new teachers.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint Teacher-Administrator Peer Review Panel</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Program’s governance structure shall include a Joint Teacher—Administrator<br/>Peer Review Panel (the “PAR Panel” or “Panel”). All duties and responsibilities<br/>not specifically assigned to the Panel by this Article (see C4, below) shall remain<br/>with the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel shall consist of five members, three of whom shall be permanent<br/>certificated classroom teachers who have served as Support Provider/Consulting<br/>Teachers for a minimum of two years. They will be chosen through an election</p>
<p>XIX- 1</p>
<p>conducted by the Association only among certificated classroom teachers. The<br/>coordinators of the program will attend all PAR panel meetings and will serve in<br/>an advisory capacity to the panel and assist in hiring and the evaluation of the<br/>program. The remaining members shall be school site administrators or other<br/>management employees appointed by the Superintendent or his/her designee.<br/>Teacher Panel members shall serve four-year staggered terms except that in the<br/>initial Panel the three teachers shall draw lots; the first term of one teacher shall<br/>be two years, the second teacher’s first term shall be three years, and the third<br/>teacher’s first term shall be four years. The successor of each teacher shall serve a<br/>four-year term. The administrator Panel members shall serve the length of time<br/>determined by the Superintendent but may be removed and replaced by the<br/>Superintendent at any time.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel shall attempt to make decisions by consensus; if a vote is required,<br/>however, action of the Panel shall require the affirmative vote of at least three<br/>members. For purposes of coordination of the PAR Program, the Panel will<br/>communicate directly with the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel shall:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select a chairperson;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish Panel rules and regulations;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide for Panel member training;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Support Provider/Consulting Teachers from those applicants (see</p>
<p>D.4, below) and monitor their work by providing the opportunity for<br/>Participating Teachers to give input regarding the effectiveness of the<br/>support given by the BTSA Support Provider/Consulting Teacher. This<br/>may be given in written form directly to one of the District Coordinators<br/>for review. This input may be shared with the Support<br/>Provider/Consulting Teacher and his/her site administrator, if requested by<br/>the Support Provider/Consulting Teacher, but will not become part of the<br/>Consulting Teacher’s personnel file.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide for Consulting Teacher Training.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review peer review reports and related documents prepared by Support<br/>Provider/Consulting Teachers;</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a referral from an evaluator, appoint a Support<br/>Provider/Consulting Teacher to provide assistance to and review of a<br/>referred PAR participant and send written notice of the appointment to the<br/>referred PAR participant, the Support Provider/Consulting Teacher, and<br/>the site administrator of the participant;</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitor the progress of referred PAR participants, and by April 1 of the<br/>school year in which the PAR Program was used to assist a teacher make</p>
<p>XIX-2</p>
<p>recommendations to the District’s Board of Trustees regarding each<br/>referred PAR participant, including forwarding to the Board the names of<br/>referred PAR participants who, after sustained assistance by a Support<br/>Provider/Consulting Teacher(s), have not demonstrated satisfactory<br/>improvement. All reports made to the Board pursuant to this provision<br/>shall also be delivered to the Superintendent/designee by April 1. At least<br/>five teacher work days before any Panel report regarding a referred PAR<br/>participant is submitted to the Board of Trustees, it will be provided to the<br/>referred PAR participant, the site administrator, and the Support<br/>Provider/Consulting Teacher;</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in one year five or more teachers have been referred to the program, the<br/>panel will evaluate the impact of the PAR Program in order to improve the<br/>Program. Evaluation may include (but is not limited to) interviews or<br/>surveys of Program participants;</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit recommendations for improvement of the PAR Program to the<br/>District’s Board of Trustees and the Association each year by May 1; and</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consultation with the Superintendent or his/her designee, annually<br/>recommend a budget for the PAR Program which shall be subject to final<br/>revision and approval by the Superintendent and Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>The Panel shall meet at least four times each school year to review the work of the<br/>Support Provider/Consulting Teachers and to accomplish other business within its<br/>jurisdiction. Annually each teacher PAR Panel member shall be paid a stipend of $800.00<br/>(in ten equal payments) from the total annual State funding for the PAR Program in the<br/>District. The stipend anticipates additional work by each teacher Panel member not to<br/>exceed 32 hours in any school year. If the 32-hour time limit is exceeded, the teacher<br/>Panel member will receive the contractually agreed upon current hourly rate.</p>
<p>D. Consulting Teachers</p>

<p>each of the four following designated grade categories: K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12.</p>
<p>A Support Provider/Consulting Teacher may serve more than one term.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support Provider/Consulting Teachers shall serve three-year staggered terms and</p>
<p>may continue to serve on an annual basis based upon need and approval of the</p>
<p>PAR Panel.</p>
