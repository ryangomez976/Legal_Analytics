<p>15</p>

<p>8.14.2 Reasons for Leave</p>
<p>State and federal laws allow FMLA Leave for various reasons. Because an employee’s rights</p>
<p>and obligations may vary depending upon the reason for the FMLA Leave, it is important to</p>
<p>identify the purpose or reason for the leave. FMLA Leave may be used for one of the</p>
<p>following reasons:</p>

<p>8.14.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a “qualifying exigency,” as defined under the FMLA, arising from a spouse’s, child’s,<br/>or parent’s active duty or call to active duty in a foreign country as a member of the<br/>military reserves, National Guard or Armed Forces (“Military Emergency Leave”); or</p>
<p>8.14.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to care for a spouse, child, parent or next of kin (nearest blood relative) who is: £a} an<br/>Armed Forces member (including the military reserves and National Guard)<br/>undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in an outpatient<br/>status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list—with a serious injury or<br/>illness incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while on active duty that may render<br/>the individual medically unfit to perform his or her military duties; or (b) a person who,<br/>during the five (5) years prior to the treatment necessitating the leave, served in the<br/>active military, Naval, or Air Service, and who was discharged or released therefrom<br/>under conditions other than dishonorable (a “veteran” as defined by the Department<br/>of Veteran Affairs) and who has a qualifying injury or illness incurred or aggravated in<br/>the line of duty while on active duty that manifested itself before or after the member<br/>became a veteran (“Military Caregiver Leave”).</p>
<p>This leave includes the days of paid personal necessity leave which may be used for<br/>paternity pursuant to Article 8.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>8.14.3 Length of Leave</p>
<p>8.14.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of FMLA Leave will be twelve (12) workweeks in any 12-<br/>month period when the leave is taken for: (1) Bonding Leave; (2) Family Care<br/>Leave; (3) Serious Health Condition Leave; and/or (4) Military Emergency Leave.<br/>However, if both spouses (or registered domestic partners) work for the County<br/>Office and are eligible for leave under this policy, the spouses (or registered<br/>domestic partners) will be limited to a total of 12 workweeks off between the two of<br/>them when the leave is for Bonding Leave or to care for a parent using Family Care<br/>Leave. A 12-month period begins on the date of your first use of FMLA Leave.<br/>Successive 12-month periods commence on the date of your first use of such leave<br/>after the preceding 12-month period has ended.</p>
<p>8.14.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of FMLA Leave for an employee wishing to take Military<br/>Caregiver Leave will be a combined leave total of 26 workweeks in a single 12-<br/>month period. A &quot;single 12-month period&quot; begins on the date of your first use of such<br/>leave and ends 12 months after that date.</p>
<p>8.14.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both spouses work for the County Office and are eligible for leave under this policy,<br/>the spouses will be limited to a total of 26 workweeks off between the two when the<br/>leave is for Military Caregiver Leave only or is for a combination of Military Caregiver<br/>Leave, Military Emergency Leave, Bonding Leave and/or Family Care Leave.</p>
<p>8.14.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under some circumstances, an employee may take FMLA Leave intermittently—which<br/>means taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing the employee’s normal weekly or<br/>daily work schedule.</p>
<p>8.14.4 Notice and Certification</p>
<p>8.14.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonding, Family Care, and Serious Health Condition Leave Requirements</p>

<p>8.14.4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the County Office’s expense, the County Office may also require a<br/>second or third medical opinion regarding an employee’s own serious<br/>health condition. Employees are expected to cooperate with the County<br/>Office in obtaining additional medical opinions that the County Office may<br/>require.</p>
<p>8.14.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leave is for planned medical treatment, an employee must try to<br/>schedule treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the County Office’s<br/>operation. Employees are to contact Human Resources prior to<br/>scheduling planned medical treatment.</p>
<p>8.14.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Emergency Leave</p>
<p>8.14.4.2.1 Employees seeking to use Military Emergency Leave must provide the<br/>County Office with as much notice of the need for leave as is reasonable<br/>and practicable under the circumstances. In addition, the employee must<br/>provide the County Office with a copy of the covered military member's</p>

<p>8.14.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entitlement to family and medical leave for the purposes of the unit member’s own<br/>illness (except for pregnancy disability) shall be satisfied by and run concurrently with<br/>leaves taken pursuant to Article 8 (e.g., Sick Leave and Extended Sick Leave). In<br/>addition, employees may elect to use their accrued sick leave when the FMLA leave<br/>is for Family Care Leave and/or Military Caregiver Leave.</p>
<p>8.14.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When such paid benefits are exhausted, the balance of the leave is unpaid. The use<br/>of paid benefits will not extend the length of a FMLA Leave.</p>

<p>8.14.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The County Office will continue making contributions for employee’s group health<br/>benefits during the leave on the same terms as if the employee had continued to<br/>work. This means that if an employee wants benefits coverage to continue during<br/>his/her leave, the employee must also continue to make any premium payments that<br/>he/she is now required to make for the employee or his/her dependents. Employees<br/>taking Bonding Leave, Family Care Leave, Serious Health Condition Leave, and<br/>Military Emergency Leave will generally be provided with group health benefits for a<br/>12 workweek period. Employees taking Military Caregiver Leave may be eligible to<br/>receive group health benefits coverage for up to a maximum of 26 workweeks. In<br/>some instances, the County Office may recover premiums it paid to maintain health<br/>coverage if the employee fails to return to work following a FMLA Leave.</p>
<p>8.14.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee is on a FMLA Leave but is not entitled to continued paid group health<br/>insurance coverage, the employee may continue his/her coverage through the<br/>County Office in conjunction with federal and/or state COBRA guidelines by making<br/>monthly payments to the County Office for the amount of the relevant premium.<br/>Please contact Human Resources for further information.</p>
<p>8.14.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job Reinstatement</p>
<p>8.14.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under most circumstances, employees will be reinstated to the same position held at<br/>the time of the leave or to an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and<br/>other employment terms and conditions. However, employees have no greater right<br/>to reinstatement than if they had been continuously employed rather than on leave.<br/>For example, if an employee would have been laid off had the employee not gone on<br/>leave, or if the employee’s position has been eliminated during the leave, then the<br/>employee will not be entitled to reinstatement.</p>
<p>8.14.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to being allowed to return to work, an employee wishing to return from a<br/>Serious Health Condition Leave must submit an acceptable release from a health<br/>care provider that certifies the employee can perform the essential functions of the<br/>job as those essential functions relate to the employee's serious health condition.</p>

<p>10.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a disagreement over the objectives, data and/or evaluation schedule, the two<br/>parties shall:</p>
<p>10.2.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a good faith effort to resolve the differences.</p>

<p>10.2.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either party rejects the recommended solutions, each shall be allowed to state their<br/>position on the matter in writing and attach to the evaluation form.</p>
<p>10.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, circumstances may change which require<br/>modification of the original objectives and data. The employee and/or Administrator may<br/>initiate a request to make modifications. In cases where disagreements occur, the procedure<br/>outlined in Section 10.2.6 shall be followed.</p>
<p>10.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process shall include the following activities:</p>

<p>24</p>
<p>10.2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any areas of needed improvement that were brought to the attention of the employee and<br/>subsequently corrected shall not be included in the final evaluation form(s).</p>

The County Office may use these techniques to increase the effectiveness and to minimize</p>
<p>the need for staff meetings: staggering staff meetings on minimum days, use weekly or periodic<br/>memos for announcements or deadline requirements, use of departmental voice mail for information<br/>dissemination, use of age-group and/or disability-group subcommittees of staff, use of centralized<br/>locations for meetings, use of released time, and the use of in-service days for issue workshops and/or<br/>training.</p>

<p>A-2.2 Class placement for employees with Vocational credentials:</p>
<p>A-2.2.1 Standard Designated Subjects (Trade and Industrial, and Business Education -<br/>Fisher)</p>
<p>The requirement for the standard designated subject matter preparation, for purposes<br/>of salary schedule placement, shall be considered equivalent to the 5 years<br/>preparation for a B.A. plus 30 units (Class C).</p>
<p>A-2.2.2 Standard Designated Subjects (Adult - Fisher)</p>
<p>The requirement for the standard subjects credential of four years subject matter<br/>preparation, for purposes of salary schedule placement, shall be considered equivalent<br/>to the 4 years preparation for the B.A. degree (Class A).</p>

<p>46</p>
<p>A combination of college work consonant with the teaching position and work in<br/>business or industry may be counted as a preparation up to 7 years for class<br/>placement on the salary schedule. However, if counted as preparation, the years<br/>cannot be used again in movement down the schedule.</p>
<p>For each 15 units obtained after initial placement, teachers will move across the<br/>schedule in the standard manner.</p>
<p>For calculation purposes, 30 units of college credit may be substituted for one year of<br/>experience.</p>
<p>A-2.3 Class Placement System for Vocational Teachers with More Than the B.A. Plus 30 Units</p>
<p>Class placement for vocational teachers with more than the B.A. plus 30 units shall be<br/>accomplished as for other standard teaching areas.</p>

<p>Experience comparable to experience in Section 1 above is to be given full credit<br/>Experience of a similar nature, but not exactly comparable is to be given half credit<br/>Non-related or distantly related experience is to be given no credit</p>
<p>A-2.4.3 No experience credit shall be given for experience which is required as a prerequisite<br/>to granting a credential (such as student teaching, practice teaching, etc.)</p>
<p>A-3 Salary Computation</p>
<p>Employee salaries shall be computed by following these steps:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine place on base schedule by applying training and experience factors to determine<br/>column and step.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add responsibility credits to base salary to determine “182 day total salary.”</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine daily rate by dividing “182 day total salary” by 182.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiply daily rate by actual number of days in established work year.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add longevity and advanced degrees payment, if any.</p>
<p>A-3.1 Formula for Computing SMCEA Salary Schedule</p>
<p>In applying percentage changes to SMCEA salary schedules, the following principles have been<br/>observed:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain structure of columns and steps and headings.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain uniform increment between columns and steps.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply percentage increase to Step F-11 of employees’ placement on the schedule.</p>

Lower division courses shall be allowed for advancement on the salary schedule if<br/>taken as a part of preparation for a designated subjects credential, permit, or specialized<br/>teaching assignment. All lower division courses must be evaluated and approved by a Course<br/>Evaluation Committee from the employee’s division. Such courses must deal directly with the<br/>specific assignment of the employee.</p>
<p>A-4.2 All requests for course evaluation shall be submitted in writing and shall include information<br/>concerning the nature and purpose of the course.</p>
<p>A-4.3 To promote professional growth, in-service training courses may be designed and offered by<br/>employees, or a recognized in-service program. The courses would be evaluated and approved<br/>by the Placement Evaluation Committee. The courses would be offered outside of regular<br/>school hours. Both those teaching the course, unless paid, and those taking the course would<br/>receive one unit of credit for placement on the salary schedule for each 15 hours taught or<br/>attended.</p>

<p>A-6 10-Month Employee Option for Payroll Installments Over 10 or 12 Months</p>
<p>An employee whose work year begins in September and ends in June may opt for payment of annual<br/>salary in 10-monthly installments instead of the established 12-month pay plan.

<p>ADDENDUM D—SAN MATEO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION CERTIFICATED STAFF<br/>EVALUATION PLAN TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>SAN MATEO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION CERTIFICATED EVALUATION PROCESS</p>
<p>The SMCOE Human Resources Department and the San Mateo County Education Association have<br/>collaborated to develop and refine the certificated evaluation and assessment process and documents.<br/>The impetus behind this process is to continue to provide and improve the best possible education for<br/>our students and support services for their families.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Evaluation and Assessment process is:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to objectively and systematically evaluate and assess the performance of employees</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to develop professional competence</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to recognize performance and reinforce educational practices</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to meet the mandates of law and due process which require that no employee shall be<br/>dismissed for incompetence without evaluation</p>
<p>We believe that:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound teaching will result in maximum learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation should improve the quality of teaching/education and result in increased student<br/>learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional collegial interactions promote growth and development</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-assessment encourages employees to reflect upon their current professional practices</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary employees shall be evaluated once each school year.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent employees shall be evaluated every other school year unless the present Evaluation<br/>Report substantiates the need for the need for continued evaluation.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees with Five-year Agreements shall be evaluated according to the appropriate timeline.</p>
<p>Evaluation Process - General</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “SMCOE Evaluation of Certificated Personnel Form” was developed using the California<br/>Teaching Standards.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each administrator shall be responsible for evaluating the employees under his/her immediate<br/>supervision.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of employees shall be limited to competency as it reasonably<br/>relates to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress to expected student achievement established by the teacher</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s adherence to curricular objectives</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment within the scope of<br/>the employee’s responsibilities</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of teachers will be evaluated according to the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession (CSTP) as they reasonably relate to the needs of the student, the program,<br/>and the classroom teacher:</p>
<p>Timelines</p>
<p>September 30<br/>October 31</p>
<p>Deadline to notify (in writing) teachers to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Deadline to hold a pre-evaluation conference meeting.</p>
<p>First observation should be completed on or before this date.</p>
<p>Second observation should be completed on or before this date.</p>
<p>Final evaluation conference should be completed on or before this date.<br/>(60 days prior to the employees last work day)</p>
<p>December 12<br/>February 28<br/>April 1</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivery of expected services described by job description</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional responsibilities as delineated by the employee developed objectives</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of required records, assessments, reports and support<br/>services as determined by the developed objectives</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a disagreement over the objectives, data and/or evaluation schedule, the two<br/>parties shall:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a good faith effort to resolve the differences</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If resolution still has not been reached, either the employee or the administrator may<br/>invite a third party to assist in resolving the differences by making recommendations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either party rejects the recommended solutions, each shall be allowed to state their<br/>position on the matter in writing and attach to the evaluation form</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, circumstances may change which require<br/>modification of the original objectives and data. The employee and/or administrator may initiate<br/>a request to make modifications. In cases where disagreements occur, the procedure outlined<br/>above shall be followed.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of employees shall not include or be based upon:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standardized achievement test results</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievement of objectives stated in lEP's.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a “Needs Improvement” evaluation(s) the immediate supervising administrator<br/>shall take positive action to assist the employee in correcting any cited areas of needed<br/>improvement. The immediate supervising administrator’s role to assist the employee shall<br/>include, but not be limited to, documenting:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enacting specific recommendations for improvement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance to implement such recommendations and/or reasonable additional resources to<br/>support or facilitate improvement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods to measure improvement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time schedule to monitor progress and to provide feedback</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an improvement plan is required, the “SMCOE Evaluation of Certificated Personnel Form,”<br/>with the “SMCOE Improvement Plan,” must be signed by the appropriate Director and<br/>Associate Superintendent.</p>
<p>Self-Assessment (OPTIONAL)</p>
<p>The purpose of the self-assessment is to support teachers in identifying areas of strength and areas for<br/>growth as they develop performance objectives for the year. In preparing to develop objectives for<br/>standards 1 through 5, it is encouraged that each certificated employee complete a self-assessment. It<br/>is recommended that the employee review the SMCOE Teaching Standards. A suggested method<br/>would be to self-assess one’s performance perception for each element for each standard. The<br/>completion of a SMCOE Self-assessment form is optional but recommended.</p>
<p>Pre-evaluation Conference (REQUIRED)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee being evaluated and the supervising administrator shall meet no later than<br/>October 31 for a pre-evaluation conference to discuss and/or review:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator’s expectations regarding the employee’s duties and responsibilities</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SMCOE Evaluation of Certificated Personnel form</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation procedures</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentative schedule (dates and times) of observations and conferences</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any constraints which the Employee believes may inhibit his/her ability to meet the<br/>objectives established</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One performance objective (element) will be established for each of the six standards.<br/>Additionally, two focus areas (teaching standards) will be selected, one by the employee</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>and one by the evaluator, unless the supervisor elects the evaluatee to select both focus<br/>areas.</p>
<p>The Observation Process (REQUIRED)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two scheduled classroom observations of not less than thirty (30) minutes each.<br/>Observations shall be recorded on the “SMCOE Certificated Formal Observation Form.” An<br/>evaluation conference shall follow within eight working days of each observation unless<br/>extended by mutual agreement. An employee who receives a Needs Improvement evaluation<br/>shall, upon request, is entitled to additional observations, evaluation conferences and/or written<br/>evaluation (EVALUATION REPORT). The employee has the option to include a representative<br/>at each observation conference.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Observations shall be scheduled two (2) days in advance unless employee waives such<br/>notice.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to observation, the employee completes the “SMCOE Pre-Observation Conference Form”<br/>and submits it to the supervisor for review. The employee and supervisor will discuss and<br/>mutually agree on the content.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Formal Observation will last a minimum of 30 minutes, and the supervisor will complete the<br/>“SMCOE Certificated Formal Observation Conference Form.”</p>
<p>Post-observation Conference Planning Form (OPTIONAL)</p>
<p>Prior to meeting with their evaluator, the teacher can record reflections, on the provided form, for the<br/>lesson they have taught.</p>
<p>Post-observation Conference (REQUIRED)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless extended by mutual agreement, post conferences shall be held within five (5) working<br/>days of the formal observation.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor shall confer with the employee, to provide verbal and written feedback (“SMCOE<br/>Certificated Formal Observation Conference Form”) based upon their observations as they<br/>relate to the CSTP.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support the self-evaluation reflective component of the evaluation process, the employee<br/>may complete the “Post-Observation Conference Form.”</p>
<p>Final Evaluation</p>
<p>The Final Evaluation Form (sections identified as “Progress” for each Teaching Standard and Page 8)<br/>is to be used for a comprehensive evaluation of job performance for the year. During the Final<br/>Evaluation Conference, the evaluation results should be reviewed. The purpose of this conference is to<br/>provide constructive feedback for the evaluatee. After meeting and receiving the Final Evaluation<br/>Form, evaluatees have ten (10) working days to submit comments as an attachment. The form and<br/>any employee comments will be placed in the employee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>Improvement Plan (REQUIRED. IF NEEDED)</p>
<p>A rating of “1” in any of the six standards (CSTPs) will prompt a mandatory improvement plan. The<br/>Improvement Plan will be jointly developed by the teacher and the administrator. The administrator will<br/>have the ultimate approval of the plan.</p>
<p>FINAL EVALUATION FORM WILL BE PLACED IN THE EMPLOYEE’S PERSONNEL FILE</p>

<p>(Department of Labor Notice WH1420)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM F</p>
<p>Basic Leave Entitlement</p>
<p>FMLA requires covered employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to eligible employees<br/>for the following reasons:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For incapacity due to pregnancy, prenatal medical care or child birth;</p>
<p>• To care for the employee's child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care;</p>
<p>• To care for the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent, who has a serious health condition; or</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job.</p>
<p>Military Family Leave Entitlements</p>
<p>Eligible employees with a spouse, son, daughter, or parent on active duty or call to active duty status in the<br/>National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to<br/>address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging<br/>for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions,<br/>and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings.</p>
<p>FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave to<br/>care for a covered servicemember during a single 12-month period. A covered servicemember is a current member<br/>of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who has a serious injury or illness<br/>incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render the servicemember medically unfit to perform his or her<br/>duties for which the servicemember is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; or is in outpatient<br/>status; or is on the temporary disability retired list.</p>
<p>Benefits and Protections</p>
<p>During FMLA leave, the employer must maintain the employee's health coverage under any &quot;group health plan&quot; on<br/>the same terms as if the employee had continued to work. Upon return from FMLA leave, most employees must be<br/>restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.</p>
<p>Use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of an</p>
<p>employee's leave.</p>
<p>Eligibility Requirements</p>
<p>Employees are eligible if they have worked for a covered employer for at least one year, for 1,250 hours over the<br/>previous 12 months, and if at least 50 employees are employed by the employer within 75 miles.</p>
<p>Definition of Serious Health Condition</p>
<p>A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either an<br/>overnight stay in a medical care facility, or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either<br/>prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee's job, or prevents the qualified family<br/>member from participating in school or other daily activities.</p>
<p>Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement may be met by a period of incapacity of<br/>more than 3 consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit<br/>and a regimen of continuing treatment, or incapacity due to pregnancy, or incapacity due to a chronic<br/>condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of continuing treatment.</p>
<p>Use of Leave</p>
<p>An employee does not need to use this leave entitlement in one block. Leave can be taken intermittently or on a<br/>reduced leave schedule when medically necessary. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave for<br/>planned medical treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the employer's operations. Leave due to qualifying exigencies<br/>may also be taken on an intermittent basis.</p>
<p>Substitution of Paid Leave for Unpaid Leave</p>
<p>Employees may choose or employers may require use of accrued paid leave while taking FMLA leave. In order to<br/>use paid leave for FMLA leave, employees must comply with the employer's normal paid leave policies.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Employee Responsibilities</p>
<p>Employees must provide 30 days advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable.<br/>When 30 days notice is not possible, the employee must provide notice as soon as practicable and generally must<br/>comply with an employer's normal call-in procedures.</p>
<p>Employees must provide sufficient information for the employer to determine if the leave may qualify for FMLA<br/>protection and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Sufficient information may include that the employee<br/>is unable to perform job functions, die family member is unable to perform daily activities, the need for<br/>hospitalization or continuing treatment by a health care provider, or circumstances supporting the need for military<br/>family leave. Employees also must inform die employer if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave<br/>was previously taken or certified. Employees also may be required to provide a certification and periodic<br/>recertification supporting die. need for leave.</p>
<p>Employer Responsibilities</p>
<p>Covered employers must inform employees requesting leave whether they are eligible under FMLA. If they are, the<br/>notice must specify any additional information required as well as the employees' rights and responsibilities. If they<br/>are not eligible, the employer must provide a reason for die ineligibility.</p>
<p>Covered employers must inform employees if leave will be designated as FMLA-protected and the amount of<br/>leave counted against the employee's leave entitlement. If the employer determines that the leave is not<br/>FMLA-protected, the employer must notify the employee.</p>
<p>Unlawful Acts by Employers</p>
<p>FMLA makes it unlawful for any employer to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of any right provided under FMLA;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharge or discriminate against any person for opposing any practice made unlawful by FMLA or for<br/>involvement in any proceeding under or relating to FMLA.</p>
<p>Enforcement</p>
<p>An employee may file a complaint widi the U.S. Department of Labor or may bring a private lawsuit against an<br/>employer.</p>
<p>FMLA does not affect any Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination, or supersede any State or local law or<br/>collective bargaining agreement which provides greater family or medical leave rights.</p>
