<p>ARTICLE V - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Section 1 - Definition.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a formal written allegation by a unit member or the Association that<br/>there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision of this<br/>Agreement. It is not the intent of this procedure to provide a means of changing or<br/>adding District policies, District regulations, or provisions to this Agreement. Actions<br/>to challenge or change the general policies of the District, as set forth in the rules and<br/>regulations or administrative regulations and procedures, must be undertaken under<br/>separate legal process. Other employer-employee relations matters for which specific<br/>method of review is provided by law are not within the scope of this procedure.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; is the unit member, unit members, or the Association making the formal<br/>allegation.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “appropriate administrator&quot; is the administrator who is alleged to have violated,<br/>misinterpreted or misapplied a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A day&quot; means a day when the District Office is open for business excluding non-duty<br/>days; and winter, spring and summer breaks; and staff development days provided the<br/>grievant and/or appropriate administrator is unavailable. Any one of these exceptions<br/>is applicable subject to verification by the District Office.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues arising out of the exercise by the Board and Administration of their<br/>responsibilities under Article III, District Rights, of this Agreement, including the facts<br/>underlying its exercise of such discretion, shall not be subject to this procedure, except<br/>whether an emergency exists as defined in said Article.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Section 2 - General Provisions.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the grievant to act within the prescribed procedures and time limits<br/>stated in this Article shall bar any further appeal. The failure of the District to give a<br/>decision within the time lines shall permit the grievant to proceed to the next step. If,<br/>at any level, the grievance is mutually resolved, or if the grievant declines to take<br/>further steps, the grievance is considered closed.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until resolution of a grievance takes place, the grievant is required to conform to the<br/>original direction of the appropriate administrator.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, a grievant shall be entitled to representation by one (1) Association<br/>representative who shall be granted release time to attend any grievance conference or<br/>formal hearing provided under this Article. When the Association has not been<br/>requested to represent the grievant beyond the informal level, and the District is<br/>prepared to agree to a resolution of the grievance, the District shall not make any final<br/>resolution until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution, and has been given an opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time lines for appeal/response provided in each level shall begin the day following<br/>receipt of the appropriate paperwork. The time lines specified at each level may be<br/>extended by written mutual agreement of the Association President or designee and the<br/>Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from the action or inaction of a member of the administration at a<br/>level above the work site, the grievant shall submit the grievance in writing on the<br/>appropriate District form directly to the Superintendent or designee and the grievance<br/>shall start at Level Two.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall notify the Association of all grievances filed under Section 4.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Section 3 - Informal Level. Within five (5) days after the occurrence of the act or omission<br/>giving rise to the grievance, or after the grievant should reasonably have known of the<br/>occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance, and before filing a Level One<br/>grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an informal conference with the<br/>appropriate administrator. Compliance with this level shall be so indicated by completion of<br/>the informal conference form signed and dated by the grievant and the appropriate<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Levels of the Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>(a) Level One - Appropriate Administrator: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifteen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance or after the grievant<br/>should reasonably have known of the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to<br/>the grievance, the grievant shall present the grievance in writing on the appropriate<br/>District form to the appropriate administrator. The grievant shall concurrently provide<br/>a copy to the Association. This written grievance shall be a clear, concise statement of<br/>the alleged violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision of this<br/>Agreement, identifying the specific Article(s) and Section(s), the circumstances<br/>involved, and the specific remedy sought. The informal conference form shall be<br/>attached to the grievance. If the Association files a grievance on behalf of unit<br/>member(s), the written grievance shall be sufficiently detailed to allow the District to<br/>identify the affected unit member(s). If the District believes that the grievance does not<br/>contain information sufficient to allow the District to identify the affected unit<br/>member(s), the District may notify the Association of this, and the Association shall<br/>provide sufficient information no later than the Appeal to Level Two. The appropriate<br/>administrator shall communicate a decision to the grievant in writing within ten (10)</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>days after receiving the written grievance. If the appropriate administrator does not<br/>respond within the time lines, the grievant may appeal to the next level. Within the<br/>above time lines either party may request a conference with the other party.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two - Superintendent or Designee: In the event the grievant is not satisfied<br/>with the decision at Level One, the grievant may appeal the decision on the appropriate<br/>District form to the Superintendent/Designee within ten (10) days after the Level One<br/>decision has been rendered. A copy of the informal conference form, and the original<br/>grievance form, including the decision rendered, shall be attached to the Level Two<br/>form. The Superintendent or designee shall communicate a decision within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the Superintendent or designee<br/>may request a conference within the above time lines. If the Superintendent or<br/>designee does not respond within the time lines the grievant may appeal to the next<br/>level.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three - Mediation: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level<br/>Two, he/she may, within ten (10) days after the Level Two decision has been rendered,<br/>submit a written request for mediation of the grievance. The written request, which<br/>shall include a copy of the informal conference form and the original grievance form<br/>(including the decision rendered), shall be attached to the Level Three form. Within<br/>five (5) days after the written request for mediation, the Association shall submit, to the<br/>California State Conciliation Service, a written request for the immediate services of a<br/>mediator.</p>
<p>(1) The function of the mediator shall be to assist the parties to achieve a mutually<br/>satisfactory resolution of the grievance. At the outset of this process, the<br/>mediator shall schedule a meeting at a mutually agreeable time. Mediation shall</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>be limited to one (1) day unless both parties agree to extend the mediation beyond<br/>one (1) day.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is achieved by means of the mediation<br/>process, both parties to the grievance shall sign a written statement to that effect,<br/>and thus waive the right of either party to any further appeal of the grievance.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no satisfactory settlement is reached through mediation, the grievant may,<br/>through the Association, appeal the grievance to the next level (Level Four).</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association have agreed that mediation (Level Three of this<br/>Grievance Procedure) may be waived by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>(d) Level Four - Binding Arbitration: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at<br/>Level Three, the grievant may, through the Association, within ten (10) days from the<br/>Level Three decision being rendered, submit a request in writing to the Superintendent<br/>for a binding arbitration of the dispute. The written request shall include a copy of the<br/>informal conference form and the original grievance form (including the decision<br/>rendered). If mediation is waived by mutual written agreement, the timeline for<br/>submitting the request for arbitration shall begin the day after the agreement to waive<br/>was signed. The Association and the District shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator.<br/>If no agreement can be reached, they shall request the American Arbitration<br/>Association to supply a list of seven (7) names of arbitrators. Each party shall<br/>alternately strike a name until only one (1) name remains. The remaining individual<br/>shall be the arbitrator. The order of the striking shall be determined by lot. The<br/>Association and the District shall then be bound by the rules and procedures of the<br/>American Arbitration Association in the selection of an arbitrator and the arbitrator<br/>shall proceed under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of said Association. If the</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>question of arbitrability arises, it shall be ruled upon by the arbitrator, prior to hearing<br/>the merits of the case. In the event that a case is appealed to an arbitrator on which<br/>he/she has no power to rule, it shall be referred back to the parties without decision or<br/>recommendation on its merits. The parties shall be afforded the opportunity to submit<br/>written briefs. The arbitrator shall consider only those issues which have been properly<br/>carried through all prior stages of the grievance procedure. The arbitrator will be<br/>without power or authority to: (a) make any decision which requires the commission<br/>of an act prohibited by law or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement; (b)<br/>add to, subtract from, alter, amend or modify the terms of this Agreement; or (c)<br/>change any practice, policy, rule, regulation, or procedure of the District. The<br/>arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and will set forth findings of fact, reasoning and<br/>conclusions on the issues submitted. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and<br/>binding upon both parties. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator, to determine<br/>arbitrability and/or to conduct a hearing, shall be paid by the party that does not<br/>prevail.</p>
<p>15</p>

<p>Section 1 - Class Size. The following class size averages at the designated levels shall be<br/>maintained at each school site. When the average class size at any elementary site exceeds the<br/>below designated numbers for three (3) consecutive weeks, reorganization will occur to adjust<br/>that average. By the end of the fourth week of each semester, the District will make<br/>adjustments, either by reorganizing classes or providing additional teaching staff, in order to<br/>meet these class sizes at middle and high school work sites.</p>
<p>Section 2 - Determining Average Class Size at Each School Site.</p>
<p>The District shall use the following method to maintain the class size averages at each school<br/>site:</p>
<p>Kindergarten:...........................33</p>
<p>Grades 1-5:..............................32</p>
<p>Grades 6-12:............................33</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Level: The number of regular education students divided by the class<br/>size average (32) equals the number of regular education classrooms/teachers for the<br/>school.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary (grades 6-12):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of regular education students, including</p>
<p>resource students, multiplied by six (6) divided by the average class size (33) divided<br/>by five (5) equals the number of teachers needed for the school.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For subsections (a) and (b) above, special day classes, District designated retention<br/>and/or CSR classes are not included in the District class size formula.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a secondary school Principal assign additional conference/preparation<br/>periods to any teacher or assign a teacher non-regular education instruction/duties<br/>or work in lieu of an instructional period, the Principal shall increase the number of</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>class sections necessary to maintain the secondary school class size average at<br/>thirty-three (33). This may be done by asking for volunteers to teach a 6<sup>th<br/></sup>instructional period or by hiring qualified staff. Current employees who volunteer<br/>shall be compensated as provided in Section 6. Whenever five (5) or more such<br/>extra periods exist in the same subject area at the same site, sufficient additional<br/>qualified teachers, whenever possible, shall be employed to maintain the provisions<br/>of this Article.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination classes in grades 4-5, shall be maintained at two (2) fewer students<br/>than the site average for grades 4-5, whenever possible.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that teaching a combination class requires additional<br/>planning and lesson preparation. Therefore, teachers of combination classes in<br/>grades 4-5 shall be entitled to two (2) fifty (50) minute preparation periods per week,<br/>pursuant to the terms and conditions as specified in Article IX, Section 3(f) of the<br/>contract.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Equitable Distribution.</p>
<p>The Association and District agree that it is educationally sound and in the best interest of both<br/>students and teachers to balance class sizes/case loads in order to address the educational needs<br/>of all students, as permitted by law and resources. The master schedules, including class sizes,<br/>at the secondary school sites shall be collaboratively developed and produced by site<br/>administrators working with department/team chairs/leads and department/team chairs/leads<br/>who have met and consulted with teachers within their respective subject areas/teams. The<br/>master schedule shall be subject to final approval by the Principal. The District will make<br/>every effort to maintain balanced class sizes within grade levels, teams, departments and across<br/>tracks within each school site. “Balanced” in this section shall be defined at the elementary</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>level to mean a difference of no more than two (2) students. At the middle and high school<br/>levels, “balanced” shall mean a difference of no more than five (5) students between classes for<br/>specific class titles. If an imbalance occurs, the site administration shall collaborate with the<br/>affected teachers on a solution. Said solution shall be documented in writing to the District and<br/>AEA.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Special Education.</p>
<p>The following case load averages shall be maintained for these designated assignments:</p>
<p>Elementary and Middle Special Day Classes.................................18</p>
<p>High School Special Day Classes........................................................22</p>
<p>Resource Specialists..............................................................................28 (32 with waiver)</p>
<p>Speech/Language Specialists...............................................................68 (perSELPAplan)</p>
<p>Section 5 - Support Services Case Loads.</p>
<p>Support personnel case loads for Counselors, Nurses and Psychologists will be kept as<br/>equitable as possible.</p>
<p>Section 6 - Extended Work Time.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the provisions of this Article, the District may, when necessary, seek<br/>members willing to teach a sixth (6<sup>th</sup>) instructional period. All work shall be compensated at<br/>a pro-rate rate reflecting one-sixth (1 /6<sup>th</sup>) of the unit member’s daily rate of pay.<br/>Opportunities to teach such extra periods will be announced through site bulletins<br/>distributed to staff at the affected school site, in staff meetings, and through departmental<br/>channels. Selection will be made consistent with the guidelines in Article X, Section 3(f) of<br/>the current agreement. Upon request, the District shall provide, in writing, the rationale for<br/>selecting a probationary unit member for extended work time.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The District shall provide monthly class size and Special Education (per teacher, per period)</p>
<p>3 student enrollment reports to the Association.</p>

<p>These provisions do not preclude non-scheduled visitations and observations as an<br/>additional useful assessment technique, nor does it preclude observations or visitations<br/>during a year in which the unit member is not being evaluated. If less than<br/>satisfactory performance is observed, the teacher will be notified within a reasonable<br/>amount of time.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever there is a condition or occurrence that may adversely impact the ability of<br/>the administrator to meet the timelines, the District and the Association shall meet to</p>
<p>develop an alternative timeline.</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any condition or occurrence during the school year that has adversely impacted the<br/>ability of a unit member to perform satisfactorily shall be taken into consideration at<br/>the time the evaluation document is prepared.</p>

<p>4</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>(2) At any time during a school year the District shall notify a unit member in writing<br/>when his/her job performance is observed as less than satisfactory and the reasons<br/>the evaluator has made such determination. In this event, the District and the unit<br/>member shall meet to discuss specific weaknesses and recommendations for<br/>improvement of the unit member's performance, which may include mutually<br/>developing an Assistance Plan.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member’s evaluation includes an overall rating in a standard of &quot;needs to<br/>improve,&quot; an Assistance Plan may be developed to specifically address identified<br/>weaknesses and describe a process for improvement.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a permanent unit member's evaluation includes an overall rating in a standard of<br/>&quot;unsatisfactory,&quot; such a Plan shall be developed.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of Assistance Plan.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall identify areas of job performance needing improvement.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan shall be designed to assist in improving unit members' job performance<br/>in a single standard at a time although more than one standard may be addressed<br/>in a single Plan. The focus of the Assistance Plan does not eliminate the unit<br/>member's responsibility to remediate all areas of identified weaknesses.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member and the evaluator shall mutually develop the Assistance Plan<br/>and its activities cooperatively; however, the evaluator retains the right of final<br/>approval of the Plan.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistance Plan shall include a timeline appropriate to the concerns<br/>identified with provisions for conferencing and assessment of progress.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations shall be reasonable in frequency, number and duration.</p>

<p>pay at the negotiated hourly rate.</p>
<p>(e) Assessment of Assistance Plan.</p>
<p>(1) There shall be a conference and written assessment at the conclusion of the Plan<br/>at which time the evaluator shall inform the employee as to whether or not the<br/>goals of the Plan have been satisfactorily achieved.

<p>Section 3 - Absence Reporting.</p>
<p>(a) All unit members shall contact the District designated number to report an absence<br/>prior to 6:00 a.m. whenever possible. This will permit the employer time to secure<br/>substitute service, when necessary. Except in cases of emergency, failure to provide<br/>adequate notice shall be grounds for denial of leave with pay or for other appropriate<br/>disciplinary action. Unless the unit member who has been absent from the job<br/>notifies the office designated by the District by 3:00 p.m. that he/she will not return<br/>the following day, the substitute will be released from the assignment at the end of the<br/>school day.</p>

Unit members,<br/>excluding hourly employees, who work less than full-time shall be entitled to that<br/>portion of the leave as the number of hours per week of scheduled duty relates to the<br/>number of hours for a full-time unit member in a comparable position. A unit<br/>member may use accumulated sick leave for illness and/or injury. A unit member<br/>may use in any calendar year up to six (6) days of accrued sick leave to attend to the<br/>illness of a child, parent, or spouse pursuant to Section 233 of the Labor Code.</p>

<p>during the leave, or, if no substitute is employed, the amount which would have been<br/>paid to a substitute.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written request by the District, and for legitimate District reasons, a unit<br/>member shall be required to present a medical doctor's certificate verifying a request<br/>for the personal illness or injury and/or a medical authorization to return to work<br/>following such leave. The unit member shall not misuse the personal illness and<br/>injury leave or refuse to cooperate with a request for verification. If the report<br/>concludes that the absence is not due to personal illness or injury, or that the illness is<br/>not sufficiently severe to warrant continued absence, then the Superintendent or<br/>designee, after notice to the unit member, may refuse to grant such leave. Before a<br/>unit member returns to work, the District may require an authorization from a<br/>physician appointed by the District and/or the unit member's physician.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases in which a unit member is aware that he/she will be absent for twenty (20)<br/>days or more, the unit member shall notify the immediate supervisor of the anticipated<br/>length of absence.</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illness of a member of the unit member's immediate family or relative which<br/>is serious in nature, which under the circumstances the unit member cannot<br/>reasonably be expected to disregard, and which requires the attention of the unit<br/>member during his/her assigned hours of service.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence due to natural phenomena which prevents unit members from reaching<br/>work.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal business of the employee which is certified by the employee to be<br/>serious in nature, including circumstances the employee cannot disregard, which<br/>requires the employee's attention during assigned work hours.

<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to use leave as set forth in Section 4(a), (b), and (d) for<br/>disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and<br/>recovery therefrom on the same terms and conditions governing leaves of absence<br/>from other illness or medical disability. Such leave shall not be used for child care,<br/>child rearing, or preparation for childbearing, but shall be limited to those disabilities<br/>as set forth above.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of such disability leave, including the date on which the leave shall<br/>commence and date on which the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the<br/>unit member and the unit member's physician; however, the District, for legitimate</p>

<p>(a) Leave without compensation or other benefits shall upon request be granted to a unit<br/>member for preparation for childbearing and may be granted to any unit member who<br/>is the natural or adopting parent for the purpose of rearing his/her child. During such<br/>leave, the District agrees to carry the unit member under the District's health and<br/>dental insurance policies provided the unit member pays the required premiums. If<br/>leave for childbearing preparation and childrearing qualifies as family and medical<br/>care leave under the State and/or Federal Family and Medical Care Leave Acts, the</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>employee will be informed of this and will be offered the right to have his/her health<br/>benefit premiums paid by the District to the same extent as those premiums are paid<br/>while the employee is not on leave during that portion of the leave which qualifies as<br/>Family and Medical Care Leave under the law.</p>
<p>(b) The unit member shall request such leave as soon as practicable, but under no<br/>circumstances less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date on which the leave<br/>is to begin unless an emergency is certified by the attending physician. Such request<br/>shall be in writing and shall include a statement as to the dates the employee wishes to<br/>begin and end the leave without pay. The determination as to the date on which the<br/>leave for childbearing preparation shall begin will be determined by the unit member<br/>and the unit member's physician. The determination as to the date on which the child<br/>rearing leave shall begin and the duration of such leave shall be made at the discretion<br/>of the Superintendent when considering the scheduling and replacement needs of the<br/>District. The duration of leave for childbearing preparation and child rearing shall be<br/>no more than twelve (12) consecutive months and shall automatically terminate on<br/>June 30 in the school year in which such leave is granted. If all or a portion of the<br/>leave for childbearing preparation and child rearing qualifies as family and medical<br/>care leave under the State and/or Federal Family and Medical Care Leave Acts, the<br/>following exceptions to this subsection apply: 1) the employee need not provide a<br/>medical certification during that portion of the leave in which the employee qualifies<br/>for family and medical care leave; 2) the commencement date of such leave will be<br/>determined by the unit member exclusively as long as the unit member complies with<br/>the notice provision above (thirty [30] calendar days prior to the date on which the<br/>leave is to commence, unless there is an emergency); 3) the portion of the leave which</p>
<p>qualifies as family and medical care leave under State and/or Federal Family and<br/>Medical Care Leave Acts shall not exceed twelve (12) weeks in a twelve (12) month<br/>period; and 4) if an employee is on family and medical care leave on June 30 in the<br/>school year, leave does not automatically terminate.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is not entitled to the use of any accrued sick leave or other paid<br/>leave while such unit member is on leave for child rearing.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is on leave for childbearing or child rearing, then in the event of a<br/>miscarriage or death of a child subsequent to childbirth, the unit member may request<br/>an immediate assignment to a unit position. If there is not a vacancy for which the<br/>unit member is qualified, the District will assign the unit member to a position of like<br/>status and benefits as soon as a vacancy opens for which the person is qualified. If<br/>leave under this section qualifies as family and medical care leave under the State and<br/>Federal Family and Medical Care Leave Acts, and if an employee terminates his/her<br/>leave under this section at a time in which he/she is concurrently using family and<br/>medical care leave, he/she will be reinstated to the same or equivalent position.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any leave under this Section of the contract shall run concurrently with and shall not<br/>be in addition to any leave which may be available under the State and Federal Family<br/>and Medical Care Leave Acts for the same purposes as the leave under this Section.<br/>Any right to have health benefit provisions paid by the District, pursuant to State and<br/>Federal Family and Medical Care Leave Acts, shall be limited to a maximum of<br/>twelve (12) weeks in any twelve (12) month period.</p>

<p>of his/her child without the loss of pay. All or part of the leave may be taken immediately<br/>before, during, or immediately after the child's birth or adoption.

<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident leave with full pay shall be allowed for up to sixty (60) working<br/>days in any fiscal year for any given industrial accident.

<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees that it will not abate to the General Fund any of the surpluses that may<br/>accrue to the Self-Insurance fund.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees that the surpluses and any interest derived therefrom are to be used to the<br/>benefit of the employees of the District, by either adding coverages or reducing the employees'<br/>contribution for either medical or dental insurance.</p>

<p>Beginning with the 2007-2008 school year, the Alvord Unified School District will pay the retiree<br/>funding level at the time of retirement for medical insurance for all qualified certificated<br/>employees until said employees reach their sixty-fifth (65th) birthday, or until they are covered by<br/>a state or federal medical insurance plan. The requirements to qualify for retirement benefits are<br/>as follows:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Employees hired before January 1, 2009 must reach the age of fifty-five</p>
<p>(55) and have ten (10) continuous years of service to the District immediately preceding the date<br/>of retirement.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009 must reach the age of fifty eight (58)<br/>who retire with ten (10) continuous years of service to the District immediately<br/>preceding the date of retirement.</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have reached the age of fifty-five (55) prior to reduction in workload.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have been employed full-time in a position requiring certification for at<br/>least ten (10) years of which the immediately preceding five (5) years were full-time<br/>employment.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment must be exercised at the request of the employee and can<br/>be revoked only with the mutual consent of the District and the employee.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be paid a salary which is the pro rata share of the salary he/she would be<br/>earning had he/she not elected to exercise the option of part-time employment but shall retain<br/>all other rights and benefits for which he/she makes the payments that would be required if<br/>he/she remained in full-time employment. The employee shall receive health benefits as<br/>provided in Section 53201 of the Government Code in the same manner as a full-time<br/>employee.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum part-time employment shall be the equivalent of one half QA) of the number of<br/>days of service required by the employee's contract of employment during his/her final year<br/>of service in a full-time position.</p>

<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee participating in this program shall receive the credit under the STRS he/she<br/>would receive if he/she were employed on a full-time basis and have his/her retirement<br/>allowance, as well as any other benefits he/she is entitled to under Chapter 4 of Division 10 of<br/>the Education Code of the State of California based upon the salary that he/she would have<br/>received if employed on a full-time basis, and both said employee and the District should<br/>contribute to the Teachers Retirement Fund the amount that would have been contributed if<br/>the employee were employed on a full-time basis.</p>
<p>(h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher in the Certificated Employee Reduced Employment and Retirement Program may<br/>remain therein for a period of five (5) years or to the end of the fiscal year in which he/she<br/>attains age sixty-five (65), whichever comes first, at which time the teacher shall retire.</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of employees eligible for retirement under these provisions shall be determined<br/>by the District.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>(j) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any modification in the level of part-time service of an employee who has entered into this<br/>program or any return to full-time service, shall be permitted only with the mutual consent of<br/>the District and the employee. It is the intent of this program to provide options for<br/>employees for part-time employment to phase in their retirement program. Thus, return to<br/>full-time service of an employee who has entered into this program is not contemplated by the<br/>District.</p>

<p>In addition to the provisions of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement between the<br/>parties, the Alvord Unified School District and the Alvord Educators Association agree to<br/>implement a Catastrophic Leave Bank as follows:</p>
<p>Section 1 - Intent of Bank. The District and the Association agree to the establishment of<br/>a Catastrophic Leave Bank effective July 1, 2004. The intent of this bank is to provide<br/>additional financial protection to those unit members who incur, or whose immediate family<br/>members (as defined by Article XV, Section 2, of the Certificated Bargaining Agreement)<br/>incur, a period of prolonged serious illness or hospitalization.</p>
<p>Section 2 - Participation/Eligibilitv. Certificated unit members with more than the<br/>equivalent in hours to ten (10) days of accumulated sick leave and at least one year of<br/>service (at least 75% of the school year) in the District may participate in the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank. Unit members who elect to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank may join the<br/>bank only during open enrollment periods and must have a waiting period of thirty (30)<br/>calendar days after joining the bank before becoming eligible to withdraw from it.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall not be available to any unit member during a leave of<br/>absence. Unit members returning from a Board-approved extended leave of absence shall have<br/>thirty (30) calendar days from his/her first day of return to work to sign up for participation in<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank if the open enrollment period has expired.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Donation of Days. A unit member may elect to participate in the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank by donating one (1) day (1 day equals current daily hours assigned) of his/her<br/>accumulated sick leave to the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The unit member shall make this<br/>donation by filing an appropriate form with the Benefits Advisory Committee during the<br/>open enrollment period. This donation shall be irrevocable. A donation to the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank must be made from the unit member’s accumulated sick leave and shall not be designated<br/>to a specific unit member for his/her exclusive use. As a point of reference, pursuant to<br/>Article IX, Section 1(a) of the Certificated Bargaining Agreement regarding the number of<br/>hours in a work day, a full-time unit member will donate 7.5 hours for each day of donation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Administration of the Bank. The Benefits Advisory Committee shall<br/>administer the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The Benefits Advisory Committee shall be<br/>responsible for receiving leave requests, verifying the validity of requests, approving or<br/>denying requests, communicating its decision to affected unit members and the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, determining when new sick leave assessments of bank<br/>members will be made, and soliciting donations of sick leave from eligible unit members.</p>
<p>Section 5 - Additional Donations. Additional donations will be assessed of each<br/>participant if the number of hours in the bank falls below seven hundred fifty (750) hours.<br/>Such assessments shall be made in writing and approved by the unit member to continue<br/>current participation in the bank. Unit members who are drawing from the bank at the time</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>of the assessment will not be required to contribute in order to remain eligible to receive<br/>benefits from the bank.</p>
<p>Section 6 - Enrollment Procedures. Initial enrollment shall be October 8, 2004, through<br/>December 3, 2004. Thereafter, the open enrollment period each year for unit members to<br/>participate in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be July 1 through October 1. Once a unit<br/>member becomes a participant in the Catastrophic Leave Bank, he/she shall not be required<br/>to re-enroll each year, but a unit member shall be required to renew their participation in the<br/>bank whenever member assessments are required by the Benefits Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Section 7 - Procedure to Use/Withdraw/ Catastrophic Leave - Conditions and<br/>Restrictions.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be eligible to withdraw catastrophic leave from the bank, the unit member must<br/>be a participant and have exhausted all of his/her current and accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of this leave must be used prior to being compensated for differential pay<br/>where that applies.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member electing to use the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall complete an<br/>appropriate form in order to make a draw on the bank. The unit member must submit<br/>this form to the AEA or Risk Management office for consideration by the Benefits<br/>Advisory Committee for processing. In the request, the unit member shall clearly state<br/>the details of his/her injury/illness and the number of days of catastrophic leave he/she is<br/>requesting from the bank. Appropriate written verification of the illness or injury,<br/>including but not limited to an off-work order signed by the unit member’s physician,<br/>must be included with the request. The unit member should be prepared to provide<br/>additional documentation on the nature and severity of the illness or injury if requested<br/>by the Benefits Advisory Committee, and decisions of that Committee shall be final.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the unit member is personally unable to apply for catastrophic leave, an<br/>immediate family member or unit member’s agent may make the request for the<br/>applicant.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the unit member may reasonably be presumed to be eligible for disability retirement<br/>under STRS, or, if applicable, Social Security, he/she may be required to apply for such<br/>retirement. Failure of the unit member to submit a complete application, including<br/>medical information provided by the applicant’s physician within twenty (20) calendar<br/>days, will disqualify the unit member from further Catastrophic Leave Bank benefits.</p>
<p>Section 8 - Allowable Duty Days. The maximum number of duty days allowed to be<br/>utilized by one unit member for a single injury/illness shall not normally exceed twenty (20)<br/>duty days. The number of sick bank days needed by the unit member shall be specified in<br/>the request. The unit member may request up to twenty (20) additional days by filing an<br/>additional request for consideration by the Benefits Advisory Committee. Any days<br/>approved by the Committee but unused by the unit member shall be returned to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank. No unit member shall receive more than forty (40) days for a single<br/>injury/illness from the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>Section 9 - Method of Payment. When a unit member uses a day from the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank, pay for that day shall be at the same rate the unit member would have received</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>had he/she worked that day. No distinction shall be made as to the differing pay rates of the<br/>donor or the recipients.</p>
<p>Section 10 - Cancellation of Participation. Cancellation of the unit member’s<br/>membership in the Catastrophic Leave Bank occurs automatically whenever he/she fails to<br/>make an assessed contribution. The unit member shall not be eligible to draw from the bank<br/>as of the effective date of cancellation. Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall not be returned to the unit member’s account of<br/>accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>Section 11 - Accounting. By September 20th of each year, the Payroll Office shall provide<br/>the Benefits Advisory Committee with a statement detailing the number of hours withdrawn<br/>from the Bank during the past year and the number of hours available in the bank as of the<br/>first of July of the current year.</p>
<p>Section 12 - Termination of Catastrophic Leave Bank. If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is<br/>terminated for any reason, the hours remaining in the bank shall be equally distributed to the<br/>current members of the Catastrophic Leave Bank. In the event of a natural disaster or<br/>catastrophic event, the Superintendent shall retain the right to suspend the provisions of this<br/>side letter.</p>
<p>Section 13 - Hold Harmless. The Association agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf<br/>or on behalf of any unit member, any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind related to any<br/>attempt by a unit member to retrieve donated sick leave used by another unit member<br/>pursuant to this provision. The Association also agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf<br/>or on behalf of any unit members, any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind which<br/>attempts to challenge in any way the legality of enforcement of this provision.</p>
<p>The Association agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the District from any loss<br/>or damages arising from the implementation of this provision.</p>
<p>In the event of any grievance, claim or lawsuit challenging the legality or enforcement of<br/>this provision, the district may terminate this provision upon written notice to the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>Section 14 - Term of Agreement. The provisions of this Side Letter of Agreement shall<br/>continue in effect year-by-year. If one (1) of the parties notifies the other in writing of its<br/>request to modify or amend this Agreement, the parties shall meet to discuss the requested<br/>change(s).</p>
