<p>5.1 Definitions</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a claim by one (1) or more teachers that there has been a<br/>violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Agreement.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “group grievance” is a claim by two (2) or more teachers that there has<br/>been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Agreement.</p>
<p>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “grievant” is any person or persons making the claim.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “duty day” is a day when teachers are on duty.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may from<br/>time to time arise affecting the welfare or working conditions of teachers.<br/>Both parties agree that these procedures will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>teachers having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any<br/>appropriate member of the administration, prior to the formal filing of the<br/>grievance, and to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by the<br/>Association, provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the<br/>terms of this Agreement. Once a formal grievance has been filed, the<br/>President of the Association shall be informed in writing within two (2)<br/>days by the Administration that (a) a grievance has been filed, and (b) the<br/>name of the grievant.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Limits</p>
<p>5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day following receipt<br/>of the grievance, grievance appeal or written decision.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time limits may be extended by mutual agreement, in writing.</p>
<p>5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year, the time limits set forth herein, except at Level One, will be extended<br/>if the grievant requests.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>5.4 Procedure</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Meeting: An aggrieved person will first discuss the grievance<br/>with the appropriate principal or immediate superior, either directly or<br/>through the Association’s designated Grievance Representative, with the<br/>objective of resolving the matter informally. Said discussion must occur<br/>within thirty days of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance. The<br/>aggrieved person shall be entitled to have an Association representative<br/>accompany him/her during said discussion.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: Within ten (10) days after the denial of the grievance at the<br/>informal meeting, the aggrieved person may present the grievance in<br/>writing on the appropriate form (Grievance Form, Appendix “D”) to the<br/>aggrieved person’s immediate supervisor in order to continue the<br/>grievance procedure. There shall be a clear, concise statement of the<br/>grievance including the specific provision of the Agreement claimed to<br/>have been violated, the circumstances constituting such alleged violation,<br/>the decision rendered at the informal meeting, and the specific remedies<br/>sought. The immediate supervisor shall communicate his/her decision to<br/>the aggrieved person in writing within five (5) days after receiving the<br/>formal grievance. If the immediate supervisor does not respond within the<br/>time limits, the aggrieved person may appeal to the next level. Within the<br/>above time limits, either party may request a personal conference, or by<br/>mutual agreement a conference may occur. Should a conference occur,<br/>the aggrieved person shall be entitled to have an Association<br/>representative accompany him/her and advise him/her during said<br/>conference.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the disposition of<br/>his/her grievance at Level One, or if no written decision has been<br/>rendered within ten (10) days after he/she has first filed the grievance at<br/>Level One, he/she may within ten (10) days appeal the decision on the<br/>appropriate form to the Superintendent or his/her designee. This<br/>statement shall include a copy of the original grievance and appeal, the<br/>decisions rendered, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the<br/>appeal. The superintendent or his/her designee shall meet with the<br/>aggrieved party and/or designated Association representative within five</p>
<p>(5) days of receipt of the grievance appeal and shall provide a written<br/>disposition of the grievance, including the reasons therefore, to all parties<br/>of interest within five (5) days of such meeting. The Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee shall communicate his/her decision to the aggrieved<br/>person within (10) days of the filing at Level Two. If the Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee does not respond within the time limits provided, the<br/>aggrieved person may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>5.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: If the aggrieved party is not satisfied with the disposition of<br/>the grievance or if no disposition has occurred within five (5) days of such<br/>meeting or ten (10) days from the date of the receipt of the grievance at<br/>Level Two, the aggrieved party may request the Association to submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>5.4.4.1</p>
<p>If the Association proceeds to arbitration, it shall notify the<br/>District (of such decision) in writing. Within ten (10) days of<br/>such notification, representatives of the District and the<br/>Association shall attempt to agree upon a mutually<br/>acceptable arbitrator and obtain a commitment from said<br/>arbitrator to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an<br/>arbitrator within the specified period, the Association shall<br/>file a Demand to Arbitrate to the California Conciliation<br/>Service. The selection of the arbitrator and the arbitration<br/>proceedings shall be conducted under the Voluntary Labor<br/>Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>5.4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision shall be in writing and shall set forth<br/>the findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions of the issues<br/>submitted. The arbitrator shall be without power or authority<br/>to make any decision which requires the commission of an<br/>act prohibited by law or which violates the terms of this<br/>Agreement. Nor shall the arbitrator have power to add to or<br/>to subtract from the terms of this agreement. However, it is<br/>agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to include in any<br/>award such financial reimbursement or any other remedies<br/>as he/she judges to be proper under the circumstances. The<br/>decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the Association<br/>and the Superintendent, and will be final and binding upon<br/>the parties. If any questions arise as to the arbitrability of the<br/>grievance, such question shall be ruled upon by the<br/>arbitrator, after hearing the merits of the case.</p>
<p>5.4.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All initial costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but<br/>not limited to per diem expenses and the cost of any hearing<br/>room, will be borne equally by the District and the<br/>Association. All other costs, except for released time for the<br/>grievant(s), Association representative(s), and witness(es),<br/>will be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Representatives</p>
<p>5.5.1 A unit member alleging a grievance may be represented at all stages of<br/>the grievance procedure by an Association-designated representative.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>5.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, either on its own behalf on matters affecting its rights, or<br/>on behalf of two or more teachers similarly affected by an alleged<br/>grievance, may initiate a grievance at Level One with the informal meeting<br/>timelines.</p>
<p>5.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of administrators required to render decisions as outlined<br/>in the procedures, the Superintendent shall appoint a substitute.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>5.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at a level above the principal or immediate supervisor, the<br/>aggrieved party shall submit such grievance in writing directly to the<br/>Superintendent and the Association with the processing of such<br/>grievances to commence at Level One within the informal meeting time<br/>limits.</p>
<p>5.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the Association to<br/>investigate a grievance or attend a grievance meeting or hearing which<br/>cannot be accomplished after the working day, he/she will, upon notice to<br/>the principal or immediate supervisor by the President of the Association,<br/>be released without loss of pay in order to permit participation in the<br/>foregoing activities. Any unit member who is requested to appear in such<br/>investigations, meetings, or hearings as a witness will be accorded the<br/>same right.</p>
<p>5.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing<br/>of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept<br/>in the personnel file of any of the participants.</p>
<p>5.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon mutual agreement of the Association and the Superintendent, a<br/>grievance may be taken directly to arbitration.</p>
<p>5.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may, at any time, present grievances to the employer and<br/>have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the<br/>Association, as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of<br/>the written Agreement. If an employee presents a grievance on his/her<br/>own behalf, the Association shall have the right to be present and state its<br/>views at all grievance meetings. The District shall not agree to a<br/>resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the<br/>grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity<br/>to file a response.</p>
<p>5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expedited Arbitration shall be available to the parties by mutual agreement</p>
<p>pursuant to the Expedited Rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance Form: See Appendix “D” of this Agreement.</p>

<p>ASSIGNMENT. TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to make an assignment, to reassign or to transfer<br/>an employee to any position covered by the employee’s credential. In all cases,<br/>however, the welfare of the individual employee shall be considered secondary<br/>only to the welfare of the pupils and total school program. In no event is transfer<br/>to be used as a harassment or discriminatory device nor shall a transfer be made<br/>without good and sufficient cause.</p>
<p>16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Assignment” means the initial school, grade level and/or department given a<br/>new teacher.</p>
<p>16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Transfer” means a change of school or location.</p>
<p>16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reassignment” means a change from one grade level to another or between<br/>subject departments.</p>
<p>16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Criteria” means employee’s credential, pupil needs, seniority in the District,<br/>seniority in the school, academic preparation and previous experience, in this<br/>order. These criteria shall apply to all transfers and reassignments.</p>
<p>16.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the District regarding transfer shall be final except that the District<br/>must, in good faith, follow the above criteria, and any failure to do so may be<br/>subject to the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>16.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following rules and regulations shall govern Assignment, Transfer and<br/>Reassignment:</p>
<p>16.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the District Administration is informed of a pending<br/>vacancy, the Association shall be notified of said vacancy as soon<br/>as is reasonably possible, by posting said vacancy at each school<br/>site.</p>
<p>16.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee is encouraged to submit a written request for transfer<br/>as early as possible, but may submit a request for transfer at any<br/>time he/she wishes. This request will be considered along with all<br/>other transfer requests received.</p>
<p>16.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee’s request for transfer normally should be made with<br/>the knowledge of the employee’s present administrator.</p>
<p>16.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a request for transfer is without prejudice to the<br/>employee and shall not jeopardize his/her present assignment. A<br/>request for transfer may be withdrawn by the employee at any time,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>16.7.5</p>
<p>16.7.6</p>
<p>16.7.7</p>
<p>16.7.8</p>
<p>unless a commitment for replacement has been made by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>The employee shall be notified in writing regarding the status of<br/>his/her request for transfer as soon as possible.</p>
<p>An employee whose transfer has not been finalized may feel free to<br/>contact the Superintendent to discuss his/her request. An<br/>employee will receive, upon request, a written statement within 10<br/>working days indicating the reasons his/her request for transfer was<br/>not fulfilled.</p>
<p>An involuntary transfer is one in which the transfer proceedings are<br/>not initiated by the employee who might be transferred.</p>
<p>16.7.7.1 Involuntary transfer may only be made for a change of<br/>enrollment necessitating addition or deletion of staff,<br/>class size, elimination of programs and/or funds, or<br/>school closings.</p>
<p>16.7.7.2 Procedure:</p>
<p>16.7.7.2.1 Prior to making the transfer final, the<br/>administration shall inform the employee<br/>to be transferred of the intent to transfer,<br/>and the employee shall be informed that<br/>a meeting will be arranged to discuss<br/>the contemplated action, if the employee<br/>so desires. If the employee objects to<br/>the contemplated transfer, the<br/>administration shall make an effort to<br/>find alternate methods of meeting the<br/>needs of the District.</p>
<p>16.7.7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee, if he/she requests, shall<br/>be permitted to have a representative of<br/>his/her choosing present with him/her at<br/>the meeting specified above.</p>
<p>16.7.7.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final decision relative to transfer shall<br/>rest with the Governing Board, subject<br/>to the grievance procedure.</p>

<p>Teachers to be involuntarily transferred shall have the right to<br/>indicate preferences from a list of vacancies and the Board shall<br/>honor such request on the basis of the District-wide seniority and<br/>the required credentials.</p>
<p>A teacher who is to be involuntarily transferred shall be given the<br/>reasons for the impending transfer, in writing.</p>
<p>An involuntary transfer shall not result in the loss of compensation,<br/>seniority or any fringe benefit to the teacher.</p>

<p>23.2 Additional voluntary and compensated extra duties are:</p>
<p>23.2.1 Adult Education, Home Teaching, Driver Training $20/hour;</p>
<p>23.2.2 In the event of unit member absences, effort shall be made to hire a<br/>regular substitute teacher; however, in those cases where regular<br/>substitutes are not available, regular unit members who volunteer<br/>may be used as substitute teachers. Teachers should be<br/>approached to volunteer on the basis of site teachers’ District<br/>seniority, most senior first. If there are no volunteers, site<br/>administration shall assign substitute duties on an equitable basis.</p>
<p>23.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For grades 6-12 (departmentalized classes), any unit<br/>member assigned to substitute during his/her preparation<br/>period shall be compensated at a rate of $20 per substitute<br/>period, in addition to their regular salary.</p>
<p>23.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For grades K-6 (self-contained classes) including<br/>Transitional Kindergarten, in the event that a substitute is<br/>required but no regular substitutes are available, teachers<br/>can be assigned to cover students from another class, in<br/>addition to their own class. The teacher(s) assigned those<br/>extra students shall receive compensation equal to the daily<br/>rate of pay the district would have paid a substitute teacher<br/>divided by the proportional number of assigned students, in<br/>addition to their regular pay. In situations where teacher(s)<br/>are assigned extra students for a fractional part of a day, the<br/>amount of pay to be divided up amongst the receiving<br/>teachers shall not be less than one-half of the applicable<br/>substitute rate of pay. As an example, if 24 students from a<br/>class were equally distributed to three (3) teachers for the<br/>day, and the substitute rate of pay was $110, then each<br/>teacher would receive $36.67 for the day.</p>
<p>23.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a trial basis, and for the 2014-2015 and 2015-16<br/>school years only, teachers may, at their own discretion,<br/>accept compensatory time off in lieu of payment for services<br/>rendered as a substitute under Article XXIII. Compensatory<br/>time may be used in lieu of any category of sick leave.
