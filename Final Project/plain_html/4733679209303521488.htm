<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Basic Benefit Package” remains the same, with the exception of<br/>“HMO Standard” now being defined as “HMO High Option.” For the 2008-<br/>09 school year, the district shall pay the entire cost of the Basic Benefit<br/>Package for purposes of providing medical, dental, vision, employee<br/>assistance program and life insurance plans. The yearly premium for new<br/>members will be prorated on the hire date.</p>
<p>Absent a negotiated agreement on health benefits by June 30, 2009 for<br/>the 2009-10 school year and should there be an increase in the cost of the<br/>Basic Benefit Package, the District shall increase its contribution up to the<br/>funded State statutory COLA percentage provided to the District revenue<br/>limits. For 2009-10, should an additional contribution be required, fifty<br/>percent (50%) of that amount shall be funded by the employer and the<br/>balance shall be paid via payroll deduction by the employee.</p>
<p>Since these increases take effect in different school years, they shall be<br/>reported on the AB1200 disclosure documents for the appropriate year.<br/>Other increases in total compensation that took effect July 1, 2007 as a<br/>result of the 2006/07 agreement shall be reported on the AB1200<br/>disclosure document for 2007-08.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unused portion of the District’s stated contribution creating a savings<br/>for the District will be provided solely to the unit member (100%). The unit<br/>member may use the realized savings to contribute to the IRS Section 125<br/>plan, during open enrollment and/or as monthly taxable compensation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make available IRS Section 125 plans during open<br/>enrollment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide through its JPA at least one medical, dental,<br/>vision and employee assistance plan that defines dependents to include<br/>domestic partners.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All part-time unit members will receive these benefits on a pro rata basis.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member hired after July 1, will have their medical benefit unit<br/>member portion prorated to reflect the actual number of months of her/his<br/>first year of service. Unit members with temporary contracts who are<br/>offered reasonable assurance of employment and return to work for the<br/>following school year shall have their benefits continue throughout the<br/>summer. Any temporary unit member who is reemployed but had not<br/>been offered reasonable assurance will have her/his COBRA insurance<br/>premium reimbursed, if any.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are initially employed the first day of the school year<br/>shall be eligible for coverage on the first day of employment.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who terminate their employment prior to the close of the<br/>school year shall be provided benefits through the last day of the payroll<br/>period in which the termination occurred.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are probationary or tenured who terminated their<br/>employment at the end of the academic year, shall be provided benefits<br/>through the end of August. The unit member shall be responsible for the<br/>unit member’s portion of the premium.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are absent because of illness and who have exhausted<br/>their accumulated sick leave shall continue to be provided with such<br/>benefits as may be available under the California Family Rights Act<br/>(CFRA) and the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District or designee shall inform in writing all qualified unit members<br/>and/or beneficiaries of their right to continue benefit coverage under<br/>provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of<br/>1995. The District shall continue to provide benefits coverage to all<br/>qualified beneficiaries during the 60-calendar-day election period.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who retires from the District at the age of 55 or older shall<br/>be provided these Health and Welfare benefits for the unit members and<br/>her/his spouse/domestic partner and dependents, subject to the provisions<br/>of the JPA or its successor, according to the chart below:</p>

</table>
<p>Upon completion of the three (3) or five (5) year period (depending upon the<br/>choice made in the “Coverage” column above), up to the age of 65, whichever<br/>comes first, the unit member has the option to purchase participation in the<br/>District’s benefit program. In the event the unit member predeceases her/his<br/>spouse/domestic partner and dependents, the spouse/domestic partner and<br/>dependents shall be continued to be covered until such a time as the coverage<br/>would otherwise cease, had the unit member survived.</p>
<p>If the unit decides to switch to tiered rather than composite rates, the details of the<br/>“Coverage” column above shall be re-negotiated by the District and the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unit members not eligible under paragraph 12, above, the District shall<br/>offer unit members who commence retirement the option to purchase<br/>those health and welfare benefits plans offered to active unit members<br/>and their eligible dependents, up to age 65.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who would have otherwise been eligible for retiree fringe<br/>benefits if s/he retired under normal or early STRS retirements are eligible<br/>for the same retirement fringe benefits if the unit member uses STRS<br/>disability retirement.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those retiring unit members who are eligible to receive extended Health<br/>and Welfare benefits, as described in section 7F12 above, may, based on<br/>their own personal circumstances, elect to forgo such coverage and<br/>instead receive a cash incentive, as outlined herein. A unit member<br/>electing this option shall receive annual cash payments for either a three<br/>or five-year period (depending upon the choice made in the “Coverage”<br/>column above), or until they reach age 65, whichever occurs sooner.</p>
<p>Each of the aforementioned payments shall equal 50% of the District’s<br/>contribution for the year (depending upon the choice made in the<br/>“Coverage” column above), based on the CAP in effect at the time of the<br/>unit member’s retirement. The amount shall remain fixed throughout the<br/>three (3) or five (5) year period (depending upon the choice made in the<br/>“Coverage&quot; column above), regardless of any increase to the District’s<br/>maximum contribution (CAP), which may subsequently be negotiated<br/>between the District and the Association. In the event that a bargaining<br/>unit member electing this option predeceases his/her spouse/domestic<br/>partner, the surviving spouse/domestic partner shall continue to receive<br/>such annual payments until such a time as the payments would otherwise<br/>cease, had the unit member survived.</p>
<p>G. Salary Schedule Implementation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial placement of intern (without a full credential) unit members shall be<br/>on Class I or Class II of the salary schedule.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are required to be in attendance during buy back days.<br/>Personal necessity and sick leave may not be used on these days. The<br/>District will not be funded for a specific buy back day unless the State<br/>standard (currently 95% attendance) unit member attendance is met.<br/>Should the unit not meet the State attendance standard, the Association</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>and the District shall meet and confer possible solutions. Non-attendance<br/>will result in non-payment to the individual unit member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This salary schedule increase is contingent on continued State funding for<br/>such purpose. The Association and the District shall meet and confer<br/>possible solution should State funding be discontinued.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix A reflects the last negotiated changes to the Salary Schedule.</p>
<p>H. Salary Schedule Service Credit</p>

District approved<br/>units of study for professional growth in service (staff development) shall<br/>also be counted for salary placement and movement on the salary<br/>schedule. Semester units as defined by the particular accredited college<br/>or university will be acceptable for placement on the salary schedule.<br/>Quarter units shall be converted to semester units by multiplying the total<br/>of such units by two-thirds (2/3).</p>
<p>Unit members may move no more than one column per school year.

If by October 1st, the unit<br/>member is unable to submit supporting records or transcripts verifying<br/>post-graduate units of study which are to apply toward the column<br/>movement, official notices in the form of a grade card or letter from the<br/>college or university shall be submitted. Such temporary verification which<br/>indicates satisfactory completion of the course(s) shall be sufficient<br/>evidence to meet the above requirement.

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduled school wide parent/teacher conferences as well as<br/>individual teacher/parent meetings (i.e. lEP’s) arranged by parents<br/>and/or unit members and/or administrators. Such meetings should be<br/>arranged to fall within the regularly scheduled workday whenever<br/>reasonably possible;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) Open House and one (1) Back to School Night. Note that an<br/>evening program mutually agreed upon by a majority of the unit<br/>members at that site may replace one of these events at that site.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member performance evaluation conferences. Such meetings<br/>should be arranged to fall within the regularly scheduled workday<br/>whenever reasonably possible.</p>
<p>D. Work Load And Committee / Activity Assignments</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle school unit member shall not be assigned to more than 3<br/>different preparations without her/his consent.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be required to be on duty more than two and one-<br/>half (2.5) hours without being provided a relief break.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required Committees / Activities</p>
<p>The parties recognize that the District is mandated by law to maintain and<br/>staff certain committees for the purposes of providing input and<br/>assistance, developing District programs, and training. In addition, there<br/>are various committees and/or activities which may be deemed important<br/>or valuable on a site-by-site basis.</p>
<p>Therefore, each bargaining unit member shall be required to participate on<br/>one (1) such committee/activity in addition to his or her regular classroom<br/>instruction assignment and other professional responsibilities, as outlined<br/>in Article 8.C, above. The assignment of such committee/activity work<br/>shall be implemented as described in D.4 through D.6, below.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduling of Required Committees / Activities</p>
<p>All reasonable efforts shall be made to schedule required<br/>committee/activity work outside of the unit member’s scheduled<br/>instructional time (and within the time specified in C.2), so as to minimize<br/>the need for substitute teachers in the classroom. In the event that a<br/>meeting needs to take place during the member’s work day and a<br/>scheduling conflict arises, a substitute will be provided.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Designation Of Committees / Activities</p>
<p>As early as practicable prior to each school year, site administration shall<br/>first post all of the following highest priority committees and/or activities,<br/>including the number of unit member “slots&quot; needed for each committee<br/>and/or activity. Such highest priority committees and/or activities will be<br/>known as “Tier I Activities”:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Council</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Response to Intervention (Rtl)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English Language Advisory Council</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Study Team/Child Study Team</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Leadership</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program Review (i.e. PQR, CCR, ll/USP)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any additional District committee or activity which may, in the<br/>future, be required by State and Federal regulations.</p>
<p>Next, the site administrator, with input from unit members, shall finalize a<br/>prioritized list of committees and/or activities (which reflects input from unit<br/>members) deemed important to the culture of the school. Those activities<br/>given highest priority on the list shall be known as “Tier II Activities.” The<br/>total number of slots for Tier I and Tier II activities shall not exceed the</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>number of unit members at the site. Possible Tier II Activities may<br/>include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outdoor Science School Coordinator</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Council</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home &amp; School Club (PTA)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduation Planning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent Show</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bike-to-School</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recycling</p>
<p>Unit member(s) who is/are LOETA President(s) are exempted from<br/>supervision (i.e.: yard duty), and is/are exempted from the required<br/>committee/activity work assignment described above.</p>
<p>Unit member(s) who are part of the LOETA Executive Board may be<br/>exempted from the required committee/activity work assignment described<br/>above, by mutual agreement of the member and the site administrator.</p>
<p>These exemptions may affect the “total number of unit members at the<br/>site” as used to determine Tier II Activities.</p>
<p>6. Staffing of Committees / Assignments</p>
<p>Determinations regarding the staffing process for Tier I and Tier II<br/>Activities shall be made by the site administrator, reflecting input from site<br/>unit members, taking into consideration:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal requirements or by-laws of committees and/or activities which<br/>are defined by statute (i.e. School Site Council)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choice - unit members will have an opportunity to volunteer for<br/>committees or otherwise indicate preferences</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equitability of workload</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other factors which may affect the appropriateness of an assignment<br/>(such as years of experience, continuation from previous year, a unit<br/>member’s interest and/or experience in a particular area, a part time<br/>member’s regular work day, etc.)</p>
<p>After the site’s staffing process has been implemented, unit members not<br/>yet assigned to a Tier I Activity will be assigned by the site administrator to<br/>a Tier I Activity.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>All Tier II activities shall be voluntary for unit members for that school year.<br/>If insufficient numbers of volunteers express interest, such activities need<br/>not be performed at all.</p>
<p>Although a unit member shall not be required to serve on more than one<br/>Tier I committee/activity, unit members may volunteer for additional<br/>committees and/or assignments.</p>
<p>E. Preparation Time</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All full time middle school unit members shall be assigned a preparation<br/>period equivalent to one class period scheduled within the instructional<br/>day. This shall be provided to part-time unit members within their half<br/>hour before and/or half hour after the school day without duties.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As provided herein, the District will annually pursue available grants that<br/>may provide certificated release time for unit members assigned to grades<br/>4 and 5, not enrolled in State Class Size Reduction (CSR). Such released<br/>time shall not be less than 150 minutes in a full school week (five [5]<br/>days).</p>
<p>Should federal primary class size reduction funds be received by the<br/>District and create flexibility in staffing, the District will utilize this flexibility<br/>to help reduce class size in grades 4 and 5.</p>
<p>Released time unit members shall be considered temporary certificated<br/>staff as provided by law.</p>
<p>Should State CSR be expanded to grades 4 and/or 5, or discontinued in<br/>grades K-3, the provisions will no longer apply.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be required to substitute during their preparation<br/>period. During unit members’ preparation periods, site administrators may<br/>request that a unit member, on a voluntary basis, substitute in an<br/>emergency situation where a class would be left uncovered by another<br/>unit member and the administrator and/or her/his designee is unavailable<br/>to cover the class. If a unit member volunteers, s/he shall be<br/>compensated by an equal amount of “in-lieu&quot; time for planning,<br/>preparation, attendance, conference, in-services, etc. Such service shall<br/>be compensated within 30 days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who travel from one school to another on a regular basis<br/>shall have the same rights to a planning/preparation period, lunch period<br/>and physical relief breaks as to other unit members. Unit members who<br/>work less than full-time shall have the same rights on a pro-rated basis.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>5. Unit members who accompany their fifth grade students to Outdoor</p>
<p>Science School will be provided two released days. The scheduling of this<br/>time shall be mutually determined with the site administrator and the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-service Training</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in-service programs shall be determined with school site councils which<br/>have District and Association representation in cooperation with the<br/>District’s Instructional objectives.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be staff development days as permitted by statute for the<br/>duration of this contract.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All District required in-service education meetings for unit members shall<br/>occur during the contractual workday.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any costs related to in-service programs shall be borne by the District, per<br/>district policy and state auditing practices.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendar</p>
<p>The parties agree that Appendix D to this Agreement is a true and correct version<br/>of their agreement regarding the work and academic calendar year. The Parties<br/>further agree that implementation of the calendar as described in Appendix D to<br/>this Agreement fully satisfies the District’s obligations to unit members under this<br/>Article 8.</p>

<p>Article 13<br/>Evaluation</p>
<p>A. Evaluation Procedure</p>
<p>1 It is recognized that a uniform and non-discriminatory system of periodic<br/>evaluation is required by law and essential to assist unit members in<br/>performing satisfactorily. Information gathered through such a system will<br/>enable District decisions, for which a unit member’s performance is<br/>relevant. Evaluations shall be in writing.</p>
<p>The Clinical Supervision Model is the traditional goal setting, observation,<br/>feedback, and summative statement evaluation process. This is the<br/>required process for temporary and probationary unit members, and those<br/>with fewer than five years of teaching experience.

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Grievance” means a claim by one or more unit members or the<br/>Association that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or<br/>misapplication of a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Grievant” means the unit member, unit members, or the Association<br/>making the claim.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Day&quot; means days the District is open for business.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to attempt to secure, at the lowest possible</p>
<p>administrative level, resolutions to grievances. Both parties agree that these</p>
<p>proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at</p>
<p>any level of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before filing a formal grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve the<br/>issue by an informal conference with her/his immediate supervisor. The<br/>grievant must initiate this informal process within twenty (20) days after<br/>the grievant knew, or by reasonable diligence would have known of the act<br/>or omission giving rise to the grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to initiate the informal grievance procedure within the specified<br/>time limits invalidates the grievance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant may be accompanied by another person of her/his choice.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s failure to respond within ten (10) days shall be deemed a<br/>denial of the grievance and the grievant may proceed to the next<br/>grievance level.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps by the end of the school year, the time limits set forth<br/>herein will be reduced, by mutual agreement, so that the procedure may<br/>be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon as is<br/>practicable.</p>

<p>A grievant may be represented at all stages of the grievance by (an) Association<br/>representative (s).</p>

<p>Article 16<br/>Leaves</p>
<p>GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Right</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits of this Article are in addition to Education Code leave<br/>benefits and it is understood and agreed that all Education Code leave<br/>benefits are incorporated into this Agreement by reference as if fully set<br/>forth herein.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on a paid leave of absence shall continue to receive wages,<br/>health and welfare benefits, and retirement credits in the same amounts<br/>as if s/he was not on leave. Those unit members who go on an unpaid<br/>leave of absence during any pay period shall receive her/his health and<br/>welfare benefits for the balance of that pay period. Thereafter, s/he shall<br/>be allowed continued benefits at her/his own expense.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member returning from leave shall be entitled to return to a teaching<br/>assignment, unless medically restricted.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is on leave under this Article will have the right to<br/>complete a staffing survey for the following year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement applies to unit members on leave on the same basis as<br/>other unit members.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency Leave Bank</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the Association, the District agrees to establish a bank of<br/>credit to allow additional paid leave for a specific unit member who has<br/>exhausted all available paid leave. A “sick bank” may be established in<br/>the event a unit member is ill or has an illness in her/his immediate family<br/>and needs to care for the family member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member can donate up to 10 days in a period of twelve (12)<br/>months to any one sick bank. All donations are completely voluntary.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will credit a unit member’s account with one day of sick leave<br/>from the donating unit member who has accumulated the greatest amount<br/>of unused sick leave. The District will then utilize one day of sick leave<br/>credit from the donating unit member with the next greatest amount of<br/>unused sick leave days, and will repeat the process until the unit member<br/>has received the maximum amount of sick leave credit that s/he needs or<br/>may receive under 16D.2</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, through the initial process of deducting one day of sick leave credit from<br/>each donating unit member, the unit member who needs the sick bank<br/>does not receive sufficient sick leave credit, the District shall repeat the<br/>process by crediting the unit member’s account with additional sick leave<br/>credits from those unit members who wish to donate more than one day of<br/>sick leave credit.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may not revoke a donation of sick leave. Nevertheless, if a<br/>unit member does not need all donated sick leave credits, or if s/he uses<br/>all sick leave credit allowed to her/him per 16D.2, then the remaining<br/>unused days of sick leave credit shall be returned to the unit members<br/>who donated them.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated sick leave credit shall be saved as dollars towards the unit<br/>member’s paid leave, rather than as day-to-day credits.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member must fill out a Voluntary Sick Leave Donation Form in order<br/>to donate sick leave to another unit member.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will monitor the emergency leave/sick banks.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District allows other bargaining units to donate to the Association’s<br/>sick banks. In the event another bargaining unit needs to establish a sick<br/>bank for one of their unit members, the Association may make donations<br/>toward those sick banks. All of the procedures for this will be the same as<br/>above.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Leaves of Absence</p>
<p>Other paid and unpaid leaves of absence may be granted at the District’s</p>
<p>discretion.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interruption In Service</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No absence under any paid leave, shall be considered as a break in<br/>service for any permanent unit member, and all benefits occurring under<br/>the provisions of this Agreement shall continue.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of retirement credit, all unpaid leaves will be considered a<br/>break in service and not be credited for purpose of obtaining longevity<br/>increments.</p>
<p>61</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each unit member with an accounting of number<br/>of days of sick leave s/he has accumulated plus the number of days to<br/>which s/he is entitled for the current school year. The District shall provide<br/>an annual accounting of such days to unit members by September 30 of<br/>each school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon exhaustion of all available sick leave, including accumulated sick<br/>leave, a unit member who would otherwise qualify for sick leave under the<br/>provisions of this Article shall receive, for up to (5) months the difference<br/>between her/his pay and amount actually paid a substitute. If no<br/>substitute has been employed, the difference between her/his pay and the<br/>amount that would have been paid a substitute will be paid to the unit<br/>member (“differential” pay).</p>
<p>If, after exhaustion of the five (5) months leave, the unit member remains<br/>unable to resume the duties of her/his position, and the unit member is<br/>placed in another position, the District shall place the unit member on a 39<br/>month (24 months for probationary unit members) reemployment list (SB<br/>1019).</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require: 1. a doctor’s verification; 2. evidence of<br/>treatment; or 3. the need thereof consistent with the practice of a religion<br/>of any well-recognized church or denomination following any absence due<br/>to illness or injury as a condition of payment of sick leave/extended illness<br/>leave.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave may be used by the unit member for illness, injury or<br/>quarantine of the unit member.</p>

<p>[See Section G]</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall submit notification of personal necessity leave to their<br/>immediate supervisor at least one day prior to the beginning date of the<br/>leave except where extenuating circumstances make advance notice<br/>impossible.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptable and approved reasons for use of personal necessity leave<br/>include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of a member of the unit member’s immediate family, as<br/>defined in the Bereavement Leave section, when additional leave is<br/>required beyond that provided under bereavement leave;</p>

<p>63</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five (5) days of paternity leave for a non-birth parent, without loss of<br/>salary, will be granted to unit members when the imminent time of<br/>birth/adoption makes it necessary for the unit member to be absent from<br/>work. A doctor’s verification may be required. Unusual conditions may be<br/>subject to review by the Superintendent for additional days of leave. Such<br/>leave shall be part of “Personal Necessity Leave.”</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional leaves may be approved by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the unit member need to request an extension of bereavement<br/>leave in excess of the above, s/he may elect to use accumulated sick<br/>leave subject to legal limitations under Personal Necessity Leave. This<br/>request should be made to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty/Court Appearance</p>
<p>1. The District shall grant leave to unit members called to jury duty. The unit<br/>member shall receive her/his regular pay without deduction from leave<br/>accounts.</p>

<p>When you want to obtain vision care services, call a VSP member doctor to make an appointment. Make sure you<br/>identify yourself as a VSP member. The VSP member doctor will contact VSP to verify your eligibility and plan<br/>coverage. The doctor will also obtain authorization so you can receive services and materials. If you are not<br/>currently eligible for services, the VSP member doctor is responsible for communicating this to you. After your eye<br/>exam, the doctor will determine if eyewear is necessary. If so, the member doctor will coordinate your prescription<br/>with one of our contract wholesale laboratories and dispense your eyewear. VSP will pay the member doctor<br/>directly for covered services and materials.</p>
<p>Services and materials obtained from a non-member doctor will be reimbursed up to amounts on the above<br/>schedule. If you receive an exam and/or materials from a non-member doctor, you are responsible for paying the<br/>provider in full, and submitting itemized receipts to VSP for reimbursement at 3333 Quality Drive, Rancho<br/>Cordova, CA 95670. It is important to note that the reimbursement schedule does not guarantee full payment</p>
<p>•When an examination and/or materials are received from a VSP Member Doctor, the patient will have no out-of-<br/>pocket expense other than the copayment, unless optional items are selected that the plan does not cover. Optional<br/>items include, but are not limited to, oversize lenses (61 mm or larger), tinted or photochromic lenses, coated lensc<br/>no-line multifocal lenses, or a frame which exceeds the wholesale allowance.</p>

<p>Side Letter of Agreement</p>
<p>In light of the potentially large number of mainstreamed students from the Chrysalis<br/>Center into Green Acres Classrooms this letter documents agreement by both<br/>parties on the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are assigned any mainstreamed students from the Chrysalis<br/>program shall receive a $300 stipend for the school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Handbook will be shared with all staff in the fall of 2013 that includes<br/>protocols for such things as special circumstance instructional assistants<br/>(SCIAs), communication between staff and staff, staff and parents, and recess<br/>duty expectations of SCIAs, etc.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher will be provided with a student profile which will include key<br/>areas of the IEP particularly those areas of the IEP the mainstreaming time is<br/>serving. Teachers will receive this profile in the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All efforts within the laws pertaining to lEPs, will be made to excuse teachers<br/>from the IEP after the initial introductions and goals pertaining to<br/>mainstreaming are completed.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In special circumstances when a particular student's IEP, parental requests,<br/>or legal issues require teachers giving time that goes beyond what is<br/>reasonable, the teacher will be paid extra assignment for additional hours.</p>
