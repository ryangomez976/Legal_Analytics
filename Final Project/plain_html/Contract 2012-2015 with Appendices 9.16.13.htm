<p>Agreement</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>agreement (“Agreement”) by and between the Governing Board of the<br/>Summerville Union High School District (“Board”) and the Summerville<br/>Federation of Teachers, Local 6007, CFT/AFT, AFL-CIO (“Federation”), an<br/>employee organization.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540-3549 of<br/>the Government Code (“Act”).</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement shall remain in full force and effect from July 1, 2012 until June<br/>30, 2015.</p>
<p>Recognition</p>
<p>The Governing Board recognize the Federation as the sole and exclusive bargaining<br/>representative of all certificated employees, including vocational, intern, temporary, part-<br/>time and summer school teachers, but excluding substitute teachers, management,<br/>supervisory and confidential employees as defined in the Act, for the purpose of meeting,<br/>negotiating and the processing of grievances.</p>
<p>Non-Discrimination</p>
<p>The Trustees shall not discriminate against any employee of the bargaining unit on the<br/>basis of race, religion, color, creed, age, sex, national origin, political affiliation,<br/>domicile, marital status, sexual orientation, physical handicap, membership or non¬<br/>membership in the Federation, or participation by any employee of the bargaining unit in<br/>the lawful activities of the Federation.</p>
<p>Negotiation Procedures</p>
<p>4.1 Not earlier than the first week of the school year in which this Agreement expires,<br/>and after the public is allowed input as required by the Act, the District and<br/>Federation agree to meet and negotiate by May 15 and as often as is necessary in<br/>order to negotiate, reach agreement, and reduce to writing the various issues<br/>contained within the scope of negotiations as defined in the Act.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation may designate not more than three (3) employees in the<br/>bargaining unit, whose identity shall be made immediately known to the District<br/>Superintendent, (hereinafter referred to as the Superintendent) or his/her designee,<br/>in order to permit said unit members’ participation in the negotiations. Not more<br/>than three (3) members of management, whose identity shall be made<br/>immediately known to the Federation, shall participate in the negotiation process<br/>on behalf of the District.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may utilize the services of outside consultants to assist in the<br/>negotiations.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations shall take place at mutually agreeable times and places and during<br/>the regular school day at least 50% of the time, provided that meetings shall be<br/>held within seven (7) school days from receipt of a written request. When it is<br/>necessary for the Federation to schedule meetings for the processing of<br/>grievances, it shall be the responsibility of the designated unit members (any<br/>employee included in the bargaining unit) to notify the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee of the meeting times, dates and place and to request release time which<br/>shall be no later than 24 hours prior to the commencement of such sessions. Each<br/>chief negotiator will be responsible for notifying members of his/her team of the<br/>time and place for the next meeting. The agenda for a subsequent meeting shall<br/>be established at the conclusion of each session.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the person acting as chief negotiator shall be the chief<br/>spokesman for the respective parties and shall have the full authority to make<br/>proposals and counter-proposals and to sign tentative agreements, subject to<br/>ratification by a majority of the District Trustees and by a majority of the<br/>Federation membership of the full contractual Agreement. Only the chief<br/>negotiators or their representatives shall transmit inter-team documents to the<br/>other party. This may be done in a formal meeting, through hand-delivery, by<br/>facsimile transmission or through U.S. mail. During negotiations items<br/>tentatively agreed upon shall be reduced to writing, initialed by both parties, and<br/>be considered part of the total contract settlement. All information, data, and<br/>documents requested for negotiations shall be distributed to all three members of<br/>the Federation negotiating team.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that all negotiation sessions will be held in an<br/>executive session unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in advance by both<br/>parties. Should an impasse be declared, the declaring party is responsible for<br/>notifying the Public Employment Relations Board and to comply with said<br/>Board’s regulations for mediation and fact-finding.</p>
<p>4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bargaining unit employee shall engage in Federation activities during the time</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>he/she is assigned to teaching or other school related duties, except that members<br/>of the Federation’s negotiation committee shall be excused without loss of pay for<br/>working time spent in negotiation with the District or its representatives as<br/>provided above for negotiations and for the processing of grievances, or as<br/>provided elsewhere in this contract or in the law. The District agrees not to<br/>discriminate against any Federation member because of his/her participation in<br/>negotiations or grievance processing.</p>
<p>4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of negotiations described in this Article, the parties mutually<br/>pledge that such negotiations shall be conducted in good faith.</p>
<p>4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided for herein, the designated unit members of the<br/>Federation’s bargaining committee and Federation representatives shall not<br/>interfere with the performance of any unit member’s duties or disrupt the unit<br/>member’s instructional day.</p>
<p>4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation shall have the right to inspect the original copy of any public<br/>record of the District during the regular office hours at the Superintendent’s<br/>office.</p>
<p>4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer and raw data of public records having a direct relationship to the scope<br/>of negotiations as identified in Section 3452 of the Act shall be available to the<br/>Federation in the form which the information was communicated to the Trustees.</p>
<p>If such format does not exist, the requested data shall be provided in such a form as<br/>will cause the least burden in the judgment of the District Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee.</p>
<p>4.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics and records of the District necessary for the enforcement of this<br/>Agreement (including grievances) or relevant to negotiations shall be<br/>provided in a timely manner to the Federation upon request.</p>
<p>4.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the Agenda and Board Packet, excluding personnel matters and<br/>other confidential material, shall be provided to the Federation’s president<br/>at the same time such information is provided to members of the Board of<br/>Trustees. Such information shall include copies of all minutes of Board<br/>meetings.</p>
<p>4.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the request of the Federation, the District shall provide to it the<br/>names, addresses and telephone numbers of new and continuing unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>4.11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the request of the Federation, the District shall provide to it a list of<br/>the work assignments of all unit members.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Federation Rights</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District authorizes the Federation to use the school facilities at times other<br/>than normal working hours of student instruction as long as the Federation<br/>submits the appropriate Civic Center Act form to the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee. In emergencies, the Superintendent or his/her designee may authorize<br/>the Federation to use the District facilities during normal working hours as long as<br/>the Federation declares in writing that the use of such facilities does not interfere<br/>with the instructional day. Arrangements shall be made for the use of school<br/>facilities through the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee shall grant the Federation use of school<br/>equipment as long as such use is in accordance with the procedures provided for<br/>in the Civic Center Act and as long as the use of such equipment or facilities does<br/>not interfere with the normal student instruction or work production of the<br/>District. The Federation shall pay for all and any costs incurred by the District<br/>incidental to such use of the equipment by the Federation.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation agrees to leave facilities, buildings and/or equipment used in a<br/>clean and orderly condition.</p>
<p>5 .4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spaces on bulletin boards, which shall be provided for in school buildings</p>

<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation shall have use of unit member school mailboxes for the purpose of<br/>distributing Federation material.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide the Federation President with three (3) days of leave<br/>and two other bargaining unit members designated by CFT with two (2) days of<br/>leave each (total of seven (7) days of leave each school year for the bargaining<br/>unit) school year to carry out bargaining agent responsibilities on the condition<br/>that CFT reimburses the District for the actual cost of the substitute employed to<br/>replace the bargaining unit member on leave. At least five (5) working days<br/>notice in advance of the use of such time shall be made to the<br/>Superintendent/designee. The time requirement may be waived at the discretion<br/>of the District. The Superintendent has the right to deny such request if the<br/>instructor’s absence would cause a disruption to the District’s educational<br/>program. The granting of such requests, however, shall not be unreasonably<br/>withheld.</p>

<p>5.7 Dues Deduction</p>
<p>5.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right of payroll deduction for payment of organizational dues shall be<br/>accorded without charge to the Federation.

Deductions for unit members who<br/>sign such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall<br/>be appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the school<br/>year. Once having become a member, the unit member shall remain a<br/>member as provided for below for the duration of the contract or the Fair<br/>Share arrangement.</p>

<p>Grievance &amp; Arbitration</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or<br/>misapplication of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; refers to any employee of the bargaining unit covered<br/>by the terms of this Agreement or by the Federation.</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;working day&quot; is any day the District office is open for business.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>

<p>7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is completely understood and agreed that nothing contained<br/>herein will be construed as limiting the right of any employee of<br/>the bargaining unit having a grievance to discuss the matter with<br/>the Superintendent or his/her designee and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted without intervention of the Federation, provided that the<br/>adjustment is consistent with the terms of this Agreement and that<br/>the Federation has been given an opportunity to be present at such<br/>adjustment and to state its views.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>7.3.1 Since it is important that the grievance be processed as rapidly as<br/>possible, the time table specified at each level hereafter followed<br/>should be considered as a maximum and every effort should be<br/>made to expedite the process. The time limits specified may</p>
<p>however be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be<br/>processed by the end of the school year, the time limits set forth<br/>herein will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted<br/>prior to the end of the' school year or as soon thereafter as is<br/>practical.</p>
<p>7.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One</p>
<p>7.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within twenty (20) working days after the alleged<br/>occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the<br/>grievance, the grievant must first discuss it with the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, at a mutually agreeable<br/>time, either directly or through the Federation's designated<br/>representative, with the objective of resolving</p>
<p>the matter.</p>

<p>7.3.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition at<br/>LEVEL TWO, or if no decision has been rendered within<br/>ten (10) working days after the LEVEL TWO filing, the<br/>grievant may ask the Federation to appeal the grievance<br/>within ten (10) days after the LEVEL TWO decision<br/>should have been transmitted. The request to appeal to<br/>LEVEL THREE or LEVEL FOUR shall be made to</p>
<p>the Federation, with a copy to the Superintendent/designee.<br/>The Federation shall have ten (10) working days to<br/>determine whether to initiate an appeal to LEVEL THREE<br/>(Grievance Mediation) or LEVEL FOUR (Arbitration). The<br/>Federation's selection of a Level Three Appeal does not<br/>preclude it from exercising its right under Section 7.3.7.</p>
<p>The discretion to appeal and the decision as to which level<br/>to appeal rests solely with the Federation.</p>
<p>7.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three — Grievance Mediation</p>

The mediator shall attempt to assist the parties<br/>in resolving the issue(s). If the mediator is unable to resolve the matter(s),<br/>the Federation may request that the matter be submitted to LEVEL FOUR<br/>of these procedures.</p>
<p>7.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Four - Binding and Advisory Arbitration</p>
<p>7.3.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition at<br/>LEVEL TWO or LEVEL THREE, or if no decision has<br/>been rendered within ten (10) working days after the<br/>LEVEL TWO filing, the grievant may ask the Federation to<br/>appeal the grievance (1) within ten (10) working days after<br/>the LEVEL TWO decision should have been transmitted or</p>

The Federation shall<br/>have ten (10) working days from the date of the employee's<br/>request to the Federation to determine whether to appeal to<br/>arbitration. The discretion to appeal to arbitration rests<br/>solely with the Federation .</p>
<p>7.3.7.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parties&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ select a mutually acceptable</p>
<p>impartial arbitrator. If the signatories hereto are unable to<br/>agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) working days, a<br/>request for a list of arbitrators shall be made to the<br/>California State Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service by either<br/>party, and the parties will then be bound by the C.S.M.C.S.<br/>rules in the selection of an impartial arbitrator and the<br/>conduct of the arbitration.</p>
<p>13.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parties&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutually agree upon the issue</p>
<p>or issues to be submitted to the selected Arbitrator.

<p>11.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any absence which is supported by an authorized doctor's certificate and<br/>which is verified by the District's administering agency as qualified for<br/>Workers' compensation is an absence payable under Industrial Illness and<br/>Accident Leave.

<p>11.4.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Industrial Illness or Accident Leave may overlap into<br/>the next fiscal year by no more than the amount of leave<br/>remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the illness<br/>or injury occurred.</p>
<p>11.4.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Illness and Accident Leave shall not be<br/>accumulative from year to year, nor from one<br/>illness/accident to another.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>11.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a unit member's absence due to an industrial illness or accident<br/>extend beyond sixty (60) workdays, the unit member shall be permitted to<br/>use only as much of his/her accumulated sick leave, compensatory time,<br/>vacation, or other available leave which, when added to the temporary<br/>disability benefits, provides for not more than a full day's wage or salary.</p>
<p>11.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any period that a unit member has paid leave benefits available for<br/>his/her use, the District shall monitor the temporary disability benefits and<br/>assure that proper retirement credit and contributions for State Teachers'<br/>Retirement System (STRS) are reported.</p>

<p>11.5 Maternity Leave</p>
<p>11.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity leave shall be granted to any unit member who is an expectant<br/>mother.</p>
<p>11.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of the beginning of such leave shall be determined as follows: By<br/>the employee and her physician who together determine that the employee<br/>is not capable of fully performing her duties and that continued<br/>employment would result in possible detriment to the welfare of the<br/>students or the health of the employee.</p>
<p>11.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of the resumption of duties by the unit member shall be<br/>determined upon the presentation by the unit member of written evidence</p>

<p>11.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such leave continues past the period covered by such sick leave, and<br/>such unit member wishes to continue such leave, the Trustees, upon the<br/>recommendations of the Superintendent, shall have the right to determine,<br/>based upon the individual circumstances involved, whether or not to grant<br/>such additional leave.</p>
<p>11.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Trustees determine such time should be granted, such additional<br/>time shall be with payment of his daily compensation, less any amounts<br/>paid to a substitute, or which would have been paid to a substitute during<br/>his absence, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Illness and Accident Leave</p>
<p>11.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year, when a person employed in a position requiring<br/>certification qualifications has exhausted all available sick leave, including<br/>all accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent from his/her duties<br/>on account of illness or accident for an additional period of five school<br/>months, whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the<br/>employment of the employee, the amount deducted from the salary due<br/>him/her for any of the additional five months in which the absence occurs<br/>shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a substitute employee<br/>employed to fill his/her position during his/her absence or, if no substitute<br/>employee was employed, the amount that would have been paid to the<br/>substitute had he/she been employed. The District shall make every<br/>reasonable effort to secure the services of a substitute employee.</p>
<p>11.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>period shall run consecutively.</p>
<p>11.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be provided more than one five-month period per<br/>illness or accident. However, if a school year terminates before the<br/>five-month period is exhausted, the employee may take the balance of the<br/>five-month period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>11.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount paid the substitute employee during any month shall be less<br/>than the salary due the employee absent from his/her duties.</p>
<p>11.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave, including<br/>accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent on account of illness or<br/>accident for a period beyond the five-month period provided pursuant to<br/>Section 44977, and the employee is not medically able to resume the<br/>duties of his/her position, the employee shall, if not placed in another<br/>position, be placed on a reemployment list for a period of 24 months if the<br/>employee is on probationary status, or for a period of 39 months if the<br/>employee is on permanent status. When the employee is medically able,<br/>during the 24 or 39-month period, the unit member shall be returned to<br/>employment in a position for which he/she is credentialed and qualified.<br/>The District maintains the right to place the employee in the position<br/>which best meets the needs of the District. The 24-month or 39-month<br/>period shall commence at the expiration of the five-month period provided<br/>pursuant to Section 44977.</p>
<p>11.8 Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>11.8.1 Ten (10) days of sick leave per year may be used for personal necessity<br/>purposes. The following do not require any advanced notice:</p>
<p>11.8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious injury of a member of the unit member’s<br/>immediate family. “Immediate family” is defined as the<br/>spouse, mother, father, mother-in-law, father-in-law,<br/>son/daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandmother,<br/>grandfather or grandchild of the unit member or the unit<br/>member’s brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law or<br/>anyone living in the immediate household of the unit<br/>member or any person standing “in loco parentis.” “In loco<br/>parentis” refers to someone who reared the Unit Member in<br/>place of the Unit Member’s parents.</p>
<p>11.8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving a member or property of the<br/>member, or the person or property of a member’s</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>immediate family.</p>
<p>11.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may utilize up to three (3) days of personal necessity leave<br/>without giving a reason for such absence, provided the Superintendent is<br/>notified twenty-four (24) hours in advance of such absence.</p>
<p>11.8.2.1 It is strongly recommended that teachers provide notice at least<br/>five days before taking leave pursuant to Sections 11.8.2 and 11.8.3. The<br/>district needs as much advance notice as possible in order to locate<br/>qualified substitutes. Failure to provide ample notice may result in the<br/>District exercising its rights pursuant to Section 11.8.4.</p>
<p>11.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any school year, a unit member may use two more days of sick<br/>leave without giving a reason in addition to the three (3) days an employee<br/>may take per year pursuant to Section 11.8.2 The unit member shall notify<br/>the Superintendent at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of such<br/>absence. The employee shall be compensated for his or her per diem rate<br/>minus the cost of a substitute for days used under this provision. A unit<br/>member’s use of these two additional days shall not reduce their right to a<br/>full five months of differential leave pursuant to Section 11.7.</p>
<p>11.8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If days of personal necessity leave are used which are not allowed in<br/>Article 11.8.1.1 or 11.8.1.2, and the unit member has exhausted days<br/>allowed by Article 11.8.2 and 11.8.3, the member will lose per diem for<br/>each day used, however, accrued sick days will not be charged. If the<br/>Administration finds that granting requests for days of Personal Necessity<br/>Leave under Articles 11.8.2 and 11.8.3 would seriously disrupt the normal<br/>operation of the school district some requests may be denied. The use of<br/>more days allowed in Articles 11.8.2 and 11.8.3 without giving a reason<br/>may be grounds for application of Ed. Code or Article 9 of this contract.</p>
<p>It is recommended that personal necessity leave days in Articles 11.8.2<br/>and 11.8.3 not be used during finals weeks or to extend any vacation or<br/>holiday period.</p>

In order to receive credit for more<br/>than 72 units on the salary schedule, the unit member must receive<br/>approval for the course work and complete the course work on or after<br/>September 1, 2001. Any course work initiated and/or completed prior to<br/>this date cannot be used to exceed the 72 maximum units of credit on the<br/>salary schedule.
