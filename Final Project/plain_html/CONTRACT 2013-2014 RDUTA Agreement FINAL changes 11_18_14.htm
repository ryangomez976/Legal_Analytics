<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>EVALUATION</p>
<p>Standards and Procedures for the<br/>Performance Appraisal of Teachers</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees, administrators, and teaching staff of RDUSD are committed to providing an<br/>effective teacher performance appraisal program as a key element in an excellent instructional<br/>program. The purpose of this performance appraisal program is to meet the legal requirements of<br/>the Education Code and accomplish the following outcomes:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain high minimum standards of teacher performance</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promote instructional effectiveness that leads to increased student achievement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinforce excellent teaching</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encourage growth and development throughout each teacher’s career</p>
<p>The California Standards for the Teaching Profession serve as the common language to describe the<br/>scope, and complexity, of the teaching act. Evaluators will be guided by the formative and summary<br/>assessments. The six standards are:</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging &amp; supporting all students in learning</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating &amp; maintaining effective environments for student learning</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding &amp; organizing subject matter for student learning</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning instruction &amp; designing learning experiences for all students</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing student learning</p>
<p>VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a professional educator</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>SECTION I</p>
<p>PROBATIONARY</p>
<p>The appraisal of performance toward meeting the standards is a collaborative and continuous process<br/>conducted throughout the teacher’s probationary period. The administrator and teacher will meet regularly to<br/>discuss areas of focus, needed support, and how progress will be recorded.</p>
<p>Classroom observation is a critical component in this process. Supervisors of probationary and temporary<br/>teachers shall use clinical supervision techniques (cycles of pre-observation conference, observation, analysis<br/>of observation data, and feedback conference) and a series of informal monitoring visits (i.e. walk-through)<br/>with an emphasis on feedback to the teacher.</p>
<p>Performance appraisals should be based on multiple sources of information. Other district personnel,<br/>materials and/or observations may be included in the process besides the formal classroom observation.<br/>Teachers are encouraged to provide additional data to demonstrate their ability to teach at the level of the<br/>standard.</p>
<p>PROBATIONARY 1 (Teacher, Interns)</p>
<p>PROBATIONARY 1 Teachers shall have at least three written assessments completed by their supervisor<br/>during the school year in addition to a year-end summary (Summary Performance Appraisal). Each<br/>assessment will focus on specific standards. A conference will be held between the supervisor and teacher for<br/>each written assessment and the Summary Performance Appraisal. The assessments and conferences will be<br/>completed by the following dates:</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup> Assessment by October 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in</p>
<p>learning</p>
<p>Standard Two: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and maintaining</p>
<p>effective environments for student learning</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup> Assessment by December 15 Standard One: Engaging and supporting all students in</p>
<p>learning</p>
<p>Standard Two: Creating and maintaining effective<br/>environments for student learning<br/>Standard Three: Understanding and organizing<br/>subject matter for student learning<br/>Standard Four: Planning instruction and designing<br/>learning experiences for students</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> Assessment by March 15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in</p>
<p>learning</p>
<p>Standard Two: Creating and maintaining effective<br/>environments for student learning<br/>Standard Three: Understanding and organizing subject<br/>matter for student learning<br/>Standard Four: Planning instruction and designing<br/>learning experiences for students<br/>Standard Five: Assessing Student Learning<br/>Standard Six: Developing as a professional educator</p>

<p>Summary before May 1</p>
<p>Summary Performance Appraisal</p>
<p>PROBATIONARY 2</p>
<p>PROBATIONARY 2 teachers shall have more responsibility for self-assessment and planning for<br/>growth. Guided by their supervisor, they will consider their individual needs in choosing areas for<br/>focus for each assessment period. However, all the standards will be addressed in the two written<br/>assessments prior to the supervisor’s recommendation for permanent status. A conference will be<br/>held between the supervisor and teacher for each written assessment and the Summary Performance<br/>Appraisal.</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL FOR<br/>PERMANENT TEACHERS</p>
<p>The performance appraisal process should be continuous and collaborative for permanent<br/>teachers. Supervisors shall complete at least one Summary Performance Appraisal every two<br/>years for permanent teachers. During the two-year period, the supervisor will make a series of<br/>administrative monitoring visits to the classroom, use the clinical supervision process as<br/>needed, and gather other information pertinent to the standards.</p>
<p>Teachers are encouraged to participate in the data gathering process by providing data to<br/>the supervisor that they are working at the level of the standards. The supervisor and the<br/>teacher will discuss examples of sample sources of data beyond the classroom that will be<br/>acceptable for each of the standards.</p>
<p>If a permanent teacher has failed to meet two of the Standards, additional written<br/>assessments related to the standards not being met will be completed as necessary to assist the<br/>teacher in developing proficiency. If a permanent teacher has failed to meet two of the<br/>Standards, the supervisor will use Form E, “Performance Improvement Plan” to write and<br/>share with the teacher strategies for assistance in meeting all standards.</p>
<p>Teachers who fail to meet two of the standards on the Summary Performance Appraisal<br/>will be placed in the Peer Assistance and Review (TPR) Program, and the principal will<br/>continue the evaluation process the following school year until all standards are met.</p>
<p>PERMANENT TEACHER EVALUATION SCHEDULE:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before October 15 a pre-appraisal conference will be held to discuss areas</p>
<p>of focus for the year, to establish methods and procedures for observations,<br/>and/or types of materials to be collected.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before December 15 a conference will be held to discuss observations of</p>
<p>performance.(Form A) The teacher shall receive any copies of written<br/>assessments Form B).</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before March 15 a conference will be held to discuss observations of</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials in a teacher's official personnel file (section A, above), as well as informal<br/>records or files (section B, above), are to be made available for inspection by the teacher,<br/>or the teacher's authorized representative with a statement of authorization signed by both<br/>the teacher and his or her authorized representative. The right to inspect shall be granted<br/>upon request of the teacher, provided the request is made at a time when the teacher is not<br/>actually required to render District service.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the formal evaluation process as provided in Article XI of this Agreement, the site<br/>administrator and the teacher shall review the informal records or files of the site<br/>administrator (section B, above).

<p>ARTICLE XIII</p>
<p>LEAVES</p>
<p>A. Transfer of Leave</p>

<p>B. Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every teacher is entitled to a leave of absence, not to exceed three (3) days, or five</p>
<p>(5) days if travel of more than 200 miles is required, on account of the death of any<br/>member of his immediate family. Additional days due to unusual circumstances<br/>may be granted by the Superintendent upon the request of the teacher.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No deduction shall be made from the salary of such teacher, nor shall such leave<br/>be deducted from leave granted by other policies of the Board.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the immediate family, as used in this Article, include the following:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;husband/wife</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father (stepfather)/father-in-law</p>

<p>75</p>
<p>C. Pregnancy Disability Leave and Family Care Leave</p>
<p>The District provides Pregnancy Disability Leave and Family Care Leave for bargaining<br/>unit members within the requirements of California and federal law. In addition to those<br/>requirements imposed on the District and its employees by California and federal law, the<br/>following shall apply to bargaining unit members who seek or are granted a pregnancy<br/>disability leave and/or a family care leave.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy disability leave is available to bargaining unit members who are<br/>temporarily disabled as a result of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical<br/>conditions. Upon request for and receipt by the District of a proper certification<br/>executed by a physician, the District shall grant up to four (4) months of unpaid<br/>pregnancy disability leave, as provided by California law. Additional pregnancy<br/>disability leave may be granted by the Board, up to a total maximum of four (4)<br/>semesters. However, bargaining unit members are advised that leave in excess of<br/>the remainder of the current school year is unlikely to be granted absent extreme<br/>and unusual circumstances, as the District's ability to temporarily fill vacant<br/>certificated positions may be limited by law. After exhaustion of all paid sick<br/>leave, a bargaining unit member who is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or<br/>related medical conditions may still be entitled to leave with differential pay,<br/>provided that the bargaining unit member is otherwise eligible for such<br/>differential leave under Education Code section 44977.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family care leave is available to all bargaining unit members who are otherwise<br/>eligible for such leave pursuant to California and/or federal law. Unit members<br/>who are not otherwise eligible may request such leave. Such leave may be<br/>requested for the reasons specified in California and/or federal law, including but<br/>not necessarily limited to the birth or adoption of a child of the bargaining unit<br/>member, or to care for a parent or spouse or child of the employee who has a<br/>serious health condition. Upon request for and receipt by the District of a proper<br/>certification executed by a physician, the District shall grant family care leave<br/>without pay in increments and total amounts pursuant to California and/or federal<br/>law. Additional family care leave may be granted by the Board, up to a total<br/>maximum of four (4) semesters. However, bargaining unit members are advised<br/>that leave in excess of the remainder of the current school year is unlikely to be<br/>granted absent extreme and unusual circumstances, as the District's ability to<br/>temporarily fill vacant certificated positions may be limited by law. After<br/>exhaustion of all paid sick leave, a bargaining unit member who has a serious<br/>medical condition as defined in state and federal family and medical leave laws<br/>may still be entitled to leave with differential pay, provided that the bargaining<br/>unit member is otherwise eligible for such differential leave under Education<br/>Code section 44977.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the need for the pregnancy disability leave or family care leave terminates<br/>for reasons beyond the control of the unit member (for example, miscarriage or<br/>therapeutic abortion or premature death of the spouse, parent or child being cared<br/>for), upon written notice from the unit member, the district shall allow the unit<br/>member to return to work as soon as possible, but in no event later than four (4)<br/>weeks after receipt of the written notice. <sup>76</sup></p>
<p>76</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon conclusion of a pregnancy disability leave or a family care leave, a<br/>bargaining unit member returning from an approved pregnancy disability leave<br/>and/or from an approved family care leave shall, where reasonably possible, be<br/>returned to the same assignment which was vacated at the start of the leave. If the<br/>same assignment is not available, the bargaining unit member will be returned to<br/>an assignment for which he or she is certificated and qualified.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent required by federal law, the District shall continue its health<br/>insurance contributions for the bargaining unit member during a family care<br/>leave. To the extent that such contributions are not required by federal law, the<br/>unit member may continue health insurance coverage by advance monthly<br/>payment of premiums to the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for leave shall specify the choice of the bargaining unit member<br/>regarding benefits and possible use of sick leave. Upon return following<br/>pregnancy disability leave or family care leave, the bargaining unit member will<br/>be reinstated with all health insurance and other fringe benefits provided to<br/>bargaining unit members at the time of return.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pregnant bargaining unit member may continue in active employment as late<br/>into her pregnancy as health permits and as certified by a physician.</p>
<p>D. Leave of Absence</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may grant a leave of absence to the certificated teachers of the District<br/>upon receipt of a petition in writing and with the recommendation of the</p>
<p>Superintendent.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons for leave, not specified in these regulations, may be considered by the<br/>Board from the standpoint of value to the District, urgency of the request, and the<br/>employment record of the teacher.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the granting of any leave of absence, there is a responsibility of each party<br/>to the leave agreement.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District guarantees a position with the same privileges provided to<br/>other bargaining unit members at the time of return. The position assigned<br/>would be within the credential allowance, training and experience of the<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher guarantees the District his/her continued loyal and efficient<br/>service.</p>
<p>E. Personal Illness Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every teacher employed five (5) days a week and twelve (12) months a year shall<br/>be entitled to twelve (12) days leave of absence with full pay for illness or injury<br/>or pregnancy disability or family care as provided in section C of this Article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher employed five (5) days a week who is employed less than a full fiscal<br/>year, is entitled to that proportion of twelve (12) days leave of absence for illness<br/>or injury as the number of months he/she is employed bears to twelve (12). <sup>77</sup></p>
<p>77</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher employed less than five (5) days per week shall be entitled, for a fiscal<br/>year of service, to that proportion of twelve (12) days leave of absence for illness<br/>or injury as the number of days he/she is employed per week bears to five (5).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay for any day of such absence shall be the same as the pay which would have<br/>been received had the teacher served during the day. Deductions are based on<br/>annual salary divided by the number of required working days.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal illness leave may be taken before it has been earned; however, if a<br/>teacher terminates employment before the end of the fiscal year and has taken<br/>more personal illness leave than he/she has earned, a salary adjustment will be<br/>made in the last salary warrant.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher does not take the full amount of leave allowed in any fiscal year under<br/>this policy, the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;fiscal year&quot; as it is used in this policy shall include the period from July<br/>1 to June 30 of any given year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a teacher's personal illness leave is exhausted, the difference between the<br/>teacher's salary and the substitute's salary will be given, not to exceed five (5)<br/>calendar months.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accrued sick leave shall be transferable with the bargaining unit member to other<br/>California public school districts in which the bargaining unit member later<br/>becomes employed, as allowed by law.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal illness leave is a form of sickness and accident insurance and may not be<br/>used for any other purpose, except as provided for in Education Code Section</p>
<p>44981.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every absence, a teacher must fill out and submit to the Administration the<br/>District -provided absence form.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a teacher uses his/her accumulative sick leave, as authorized in the<br/>Education Code Section 44978, said sick leave shall be reduced either by one day<br/>for one day of absence or if the absence is less than one day, by one hour for each<br/>hour or portion of an hour that the teacher is absent from his/her duties because of<br/>illness or injury.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For absences over five (5) days for personal illness or injury, the teacher must file<br/>with the administration office a certification of absence from his/her family<br/>physician with an authorization to return to work.</p>
<p>Leave For Industrial Accident Or Industrial Illness</p>
<p>1. A regular teacher who has been continuously employed in a regular position for a<br/>period of one (1) year and is injured or becomes ill as a result of doing a job to<br/>which he/she has been assigned by an officer of the District, shall receive full<br/>salary for the time he/she is absent because of the injury, not to exceed sixty (60)<br/>working days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a teacher to qualify for benefits described in this policy, the teacher<br/>must file a teacher's report of industrial injury and a medical authority must<br/>certify that the teacher is unable to work.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board reserves the right to review at any time the eligibility of an individual<br/>case. The Board also reserves the right to require a second medical examination<br/>by a Board appointed physician, expense of which would be paid by the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only after all industrial accident or illness leave is used, may a teacher use his/her<br/>personal illness leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person is absent from his/her duties on account of an industrial accident<br/>or illness, he/she shall be paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any<br/>month in which the absence occurs, as when added to his/her temporary disability<br/>indemnity under Division 4, of the Labor Code, will result in a payment to the<br/>teacher of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entitlement to industrial accident or illness leave has been exhausted,<br/>entitlement to other sick leave will then be used; but if a teacher is receiving<br/>Worker's Compensation, the teacher shall be entitled to use only so much of<br/>his/her accumulated or available sick leave, which when added to his/her<br/>temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to the teacher of not more<br/>than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher shall endorse to the District, wage loss benefit checks received under<br/>Worker's Compensation Laws of California. The District, in turn shall issue the<br/>teacher appropriate warrants for payment of salary and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Industrial Accident and Illness Leave and personal leave has been<br/>exhausted and the teacher is not medically able to assume the duties of his/her<br/>position, the teacher shall be placed on a reemployment list for a period not to<br/>exceed 39 months in accordance with appropriate seniority regulations.<br/>Exceptions shall be only in accordance with Education Code provisions.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word &quot;injury&quot; as used in this policy, shall mean any accident or illness that<br/>was caused by job assignment and incapacitates the teacher so that the teacher is<br/>unable to perform assigned tasks and State Worker's Compensation recognizes<br/>same as applicable for Workmen's Compensation payments.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any injury on the job must be reported immediately. (The term &quot;immediately&quot;<br/>refers to the day of the injury.) If the teacher is unable to make the report, the<br/>department head should do so.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions in this policy do not apply to injuries incurred while off duty.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave under this policy shall not be accumulative. <sup>79</sup></p>
<p>79</p>
<p>Absence for Personal Necessity</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may elect to use up to 10 days of his/her sick leave for personal<br/>necessity absences. Days taken under this policy shall be in compliance with<br/>Education Code, Section 44981 and are non-accumulative.

<p>Other Leaves</p>
<p>In all cases of voluntary absence, teachers must have substitutes for their classes<br/>beginning with the first day of absence. Request to be excused from duty should be<br/>submitted to the Superintendent at least seven (7) days prior to the regular meeting of the<br/>Board to allow time for Board consideration of the request and determination of<br/>conditions relating to the leave, including whether or not deductions should be made from<br/>the teacher's salary. The following possibilities may be considered: <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1. Leave may be granted, without loss of pay, at the discretion of the Board and on<br/>recommendation by the Superintendent for attendance at professional meetings of<br/>educational groups at which the Superintendent and Board feel for the benefit of<br/>the students of the District, the District should be represented. Travel expenses</p>
<p>may be allowed for this purpose within the limits of the budget provision, (e g.,<br/>in-service programs, curriculum meetings, workshops, etc.).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence to attend meetings or conventions of educational associations or<br/>societies, or to serve on committees or commissions of such organizations when<br/>the activities or purposes of the organization are for the benefit of the students and<br/>serve to advance the welfare of all schools through the upgrading and<br/>strengthening of the profession, may be granted upon request of the teacher and<br/>recommendation of the Superintendent, without loss of pay to the teacher, and<br/>with or without travel expense to the District, (e.g., Teachers of math, English,<br/>science, etc.). Budget requirements shall be based on source of request.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves may be granted to teachers for attendance at conventions or meetings of<br/>organizations composed of people engaged in education, but interested primarily<br/>in improving the working conditions of school teachers, upon request of the<br/>teacher and recommendations of the Superintendent. Deductions from the<br/>teacher's salary may be limited to the amount required to pay a substitute, (e.g.,<br/>CTA meetings, conferences, etc.).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of the teacher and recommendation of the Superintendent, leaves of<br/>absences may be granted to teachers who wish to attend conventions of civic or<br/>fraternal groups not connected with education in which they hold membership.<br/>The teacher's salary shall be deducted in the full amount for days absent for such<br/>leave, (e.g., Lodge, Chamber of Commerce, etc.).</p>
<p>P. Personal Leave Without Pay</p>
<p>The Board may grant a leave of absence to any teacher who has applied for disability<br/>allowance from the State Teachers Retirement System. This leave shall not extend thirty<br/>(30) days beyond the final determination of the disability allowance. If the teacher is<br/>determined to be eligible for the disability allowance by STRS, such leave shall be<br/>extended for the term of the disability, but not for more than thirty-nine (39) months from<br/>the date of notification of the determination.</p>
<p>Q. Catastrophic Leave Program</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate<br/>the employee for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates a member of the employee’s<br/>family which incapacity requires the employee to take time off from work for an extended period<br/>of time to care for that family member, and taking extended time off work creates a financial<br/>hardship for the employee because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave, vacation<br/>(if applicable), and other paid time off excluding differential.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who is, or whose family member is, suffering from a catastrophic illness or<br/>injury must submit a written request to the Superintendent for a donation of eligible leave credits<br/>and provide medical verification of the catastrophic illness or injury as required by the District.</p>
<p>a) As in the case of all sick leave use, the continued use of donated eligible leave credits shall<br/>be subject to appropriate medical verification by physicians selected by the District. The<br/>request will be reviewed by a confidential committee comprised of the Superintendent/<br/>designee and the RDUTA president/designee for approval. <sup>84</sup></p>
<p>84</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any certificated employee may transfer on a voluntary basis a portion of his or her<br/>accumulated leave credits up to five (5) days at a time, in daily increments, to another employee<br/>because of catastrophic or life-threatening sickness or accident. Any certificated employee may<br/>make additional donati ons up to five (5) days in the same calendar year if they so desire.</p>
<p>a) An employee may transfer credits by signing an authorization identifying the employee and<br/>the number of days accumulated leave to be transferred to the named employee. Sick leave<br/>may not be transferred by any employee who, following the transfer of the designated leave,<br/>will have less than fifteen (15) days of accumulated sick leave (Ed. Code 44043.5)</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible leave credits means sick leave accrued by the donating employee.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who is voluntarily contributing the leave credits shall be responsible to fill out<br/>the necessary form to initiate this action and to deliver that form to the District’s Personnel<br/>Department.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excess donations - In the event that donations exceed the need of the individual making the<br/>request, the excess hours will be rebated to the donors, on a pro rata basis. For example, if 20<br/>individuals made donations (160 hours), and BO hours remain unused, then each donating<br/>employee would be rebated four hours of sick leave. Rebates shall always be in form of sick<br/>leave, even if the original hours donated were vacation hours.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee may receive transferred leave credits from another employee unless receiving<br/>employee has exhausted all accrued sick leave, vacation (if applicable) paid leave credits<br/>excluding differential.</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of time for which donated leave credits may be used shall not exceed<br/>a period of twelve (12) consecutive months. <sup>85</sup></p>

<p>PUBLIC CHARGES</p>
<p>A. Complaints by Parents/Guardians</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents or guardians of pupils enrolled in the District may present to the District<br/>informal (oral) and/or formal (written) complaints regarding teacher conduct.<br/>Parents or guardians should be encouraged to present informal (oral) complaints<br/>first with the teacher who is the subject of the complaint, or with that teacher's<br/>immediate supervisor, prior to presenting any formal (written) complaint to the<br/>District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative or unsatisfactory evaluation or disciplinary action shall be predicated<br/>upon information or material of a derogatory or critical nature which has been<br/>received by the District from parents/guardians unless the following procedures<br/>have been followed:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any parent/guardian verbal complaint about a unit member shall be<br/>reported to the unit member by the administrator receiving the complaint or<br/>his/her designee as soon as is practical, but in no event later than five (5)<br/>working days after receipt by the administrator. Any parent/guardian<br/>written complaint about a unit member shall be reported to the unit member<br/>by the administrator receiving the complaint or his/her designee as soon as<br/>is practical, but in no event later than five (5) working days after receipt by<br/>the administrator.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the involved unit member, the immediate supervisor, and/or the<br/>complainant believe the allegations in the complaint warrant a meeting, the<br/>immediate supervisor shall attempt to schedule a meeting between the unit<br/>member, the complainant, and the immediate supervisor or his/her<br/>designee. At the request of the unit member, an Association representative<br/>also may be present at the meeting. If the complainant refuses to attend the<br/>meeting, this may be noted by the unit member in any oral or written<br/>response to the complaint. The parties recognize that in certain<br/>circumstances the District may have a legal obligation to proceed with an<br/>investigation and/or possible disciplinary action even if a complainant<br/>refuses to meet with a bargaining unit member regarding a complaint.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is not resolved at the meeting to the satisfaction of the<br/>complainant, or if the complainant refuses to attend the meeting, in order to<br/>pursue the complaint further the complaint must be put into writing by the<br/>complainant or his/her representative. A copy of any written complaint<br/>will be provided to the unit member as soon as is practical, but in no event<br/>later than five (5) working days after receipt by the administrator. The unit<br/>member shall be given reasonable release time during the work day without<br/>loss of compensation to review the complaint and, if desired by the unit<br/>member, to prepare a formal written response to the specific allegations of<br/>the complaint. Such written response, if any, shall be prepared by the unit<br/>member as soon as is practical, but in no event later than five (5) working<br/>days after receipt by the unit member. <sup>86</sup></p>
<p>86</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the District intends to call a meeting based on the<br/>complaint, the teacher shall be given written notification of the meeting,<br/>including a general description of the anticipated purpose of the meeting.<br/>This notification shall be given no less than five (5) calendar days prior to<br/>the meeting. The five (5) day period may be shortened with the<br/>agreement of the teacher.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No record of any parent/guardian complaint shall be kept if an<br/>investigation by the District shows that the complaint has no merit, and/or<br/>the District believes that no record shall be maintained, and/or the<br/>complaint is withdrawn by the complainant.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints by Students</p>
<p>In general, the above procedures will be applied to student complaints. However, the<br/>parties recognize that in certain circumstances involving student complaints, depending<br/>on the age of the complaining student or the nature of the complaint, direct, formal<br/>meetings involving the student and the unit member may not be productive. The parties<br/>agree in such situations to explore methods of seeking to resolve the matter different<br/>from those applied in the case of parent/guardian complaints, for example, meetings<br/>between the unit member and the immediate supervisor, meetings between the unit<br/>member and the immediate supervisor and the parent of the complaining student.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investi gation/Di scipline Procedure.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District is going to question a unit member about allegations of misconduct<br/>that might result in the discipline of the unit member, the District will inform the<br/>employee in advance of the general nature of the allegations against him/her and<br/>of the employee's right to have a union representative present at any questioning.<br/>Before any questions are asked, the employee shall be informed of the known<br/>specifics of the allegations against him/her.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No disciplinary action shall be taken, or paid administrative leave imposed until<br/>the employee has been informed of the known specific charges/allegations<br/>against him/her. No disciplinary action shall be taken or paid administrative<br/>leave of more than five (5) days imposed until the employee has been given a<br/>reasonable opportunity to respond to the charges/allegations. The paid<br/>administrative leave may be extended if the employee requests additional time to<br/>respond to the charges/allegations. This shall not affect the right of the District<br/>to immediately suspend employees in circumstances where such suspension is<br/>specifically authorized by the Education Code.</p>
<p>4. Alleged violations of this investigation/discipline procedure shall be subject to<br/>the contract grievance procedure. <sup>87</sup></p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Board has reached a decision, the Superintendent or designee will be<br/>directed to inform the parties and implement the decision.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Article shall preclude the grievant from seeking judicial review<br/>of the Board's decision.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;variable payroll&quot; is that pay which is earned for extra duty, substitute, or other<br/>short-term employment. Teachers being paid on the &quot;variable payroll&quot; shall normally<br/>receive their salary warrant on the 10th of each month.</p>

<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Growth Recognition. Up to three units of credit may be earned for<br/>approved professional growth programs for each five-year professional growth program.<br/>Each unit earned will require 15 hours of approved program effort. No units will be<br/>provided for any portion of the professional growth program that is either funded by the<br/>district, performed during the normal work day or earns units from a college or<br/>university or other district policy. The following is a list of those professional growth<br/>activities that may be approved for salary schedule credits.</p>

<p>93</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVII<br/>EMPLOYEE BENEFITS</p>
<p>A. District Contribution Rates</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers Taking Medical Insurance. Effective the first day of the month<br/>following final ratification of the collective bargaining agreement for the 2000-<br/>2001 school year, the District will provide to each full time teacher who takes<br/>District-provided medical insurance up to $400.00 monthly in addition to regular<br/>pay. The employee may purchase Benefit Coverage offered under the District’s<br/>IRC-125 cafeteria plan.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers Not Taking Medical Insurance. For full time teachers with a first date<br/>in paid service before July 1, 2001, who do not take District-provided medical<br/>insurance, the District will pay $300 per month in addition to regular pay. For<br/>full time teachers with a first day in paid service on or after July 1, 2001, but<br/>prior to December 31, 2003, who do not take District-provided medical<br/>insurance, the District will pay $150 per month in addition to regular pay. No<br/>cash payment in lieu of benefits will be made to teachers with a first day in paid<br/>service on or after December 31, 2003. In order to be eligible to receive pay<br/>under this section, a teacher must provide to the District proof of medical<br/>insurance coverage from another source. If no such proof is provided, the<br/>teacher will not receive a payment under this section, and will be enrolled in a<br/>District sponsored medical insurance program.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers Taking Medical Insurance Costing Less Than Cash in Lieu Rate. A<br/>full time bargaining unit member taking District provided medical insurance may<br/>also be entitled to a cash payment, calculated as follows: taking the cash in lieu<br/>allocation of $300 or $150, depending on date of hire, and reducing it by the<br/>amount spent for health and welfare benefits for the employee, the remaining<br/>amount, up to a total District expenditure of $300 or $150 per month, depending<br/>on date of hire, will be paid to the employee. No cash payment will be made to<br/>teachers with a first day in paid service on or after December 31, 2003.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits Available. The types of such benefits which may be purchased are:<br/>Medical insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance and life insurance<br/>(purchase of life insurance is mandatory). Summary plan descriptions are<br/>available in the District’ Business Office.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers Working Less Than A Full Work Year. Full-time teachers who work<br/>less than a full-year shall receive an appropriate proration of the annual benefit<br/>based on the number of months worked and their first date in paid service (either<br/>before or after July 1, 2001). Teachers assigned to work a full year, but less than<br/>one-half (V2) time per work day shall not receive any benefit allocation. Teachers<br/>assigned to work a full year, but who work between one-half (V2) time up to<br/>three-quarters (3/4) time shall receive an appropriate proration of the annual<br/>benefit allocation (determined by first date in paid service) based on the number<br/>of hours worked. Teachers who work three-quarters (3/4) time and more shall be<br/>considered to be full-time for purposes of calculating the benefit allocation.</p>
<p>B. The parties agree that any health benefit increase, paid by the District, shall be considered</p>
<p>as a factor in the total compensation for teachers.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree to endeavor to form a representative committee<br/>each summer to review the medical insurance options and plan structures currently<br/>available, and to further review possible modifications to the options and plan structures<br/>in an effort to determine whether more cost effective coverage is available.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May of every odd numbered year (1995, 1997, etc.) the District will conduct a survey<br/>by secret ballot election of unit members for the purpose of determining whether the<br/>District should purchase multi-tiered health insurance as opposed to composite rate<br/>health insurance. The survey of unit members will be conducted in conjunction with a<br/>larger survey of all employees of the District, including those who are not part of the<br/>RDUTA bargaining unit. Only employees who are actually enrolled in a District-<br/>provided insurance plan (medical, vision, dental) shall be able to participate in the<br/>voting with regard to any possible change in that plan. The results of the election will be<br/>binding.</p>
<p>95</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits in section B.l, above, shall also be available to the retiree’s spouse and<br/>eligible dependents if the retiree opts to pay the premium for the benefits.<br/>Premiums for such insurance shall be paid by the retiree to the District monthly.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiree benefits shall be prorated based on the average number of hours worked<br/>during the employee’s total District work years.</p>

<p>TEACHER-IN-CHARGE STIPEND</p>
<p>The following sites would utilize a teacher-in-charge: Riverview Middle, D.H.<br/>White Elementary, Walnut Grove Elementary, Isleton Elementary, Bates Elementary (which<br/>includes Mokelumne High, and Community Day) Schools.</p>
<p>If the teacher-in-charge was called into use, she/he would be paid a $25-per-hour<br/>(or current negotiated hourly rate of pay). Any time spent under an hour would be<br/>compensated at a full-hour rate. So, if the teacher-in-charge took 1V2 hours to perform the<br/>duty, she/he would fill out a timecard for 2 hours of duty at $25 per hour. The timecard<br/>would be signed by the principal immediately upon her/his return to the site. If a teacher-in-<br/>charge performs duties outside of the said school day (dances, athletic events), the teacher-<br/>in-charge will submit a timecard for the entire time spent supervising the event. The most<br/>that a teacher-in-charge could earn will be $2,560.</p>
