<p>ARTICLE V<br/>DISTRICT RIGHTS</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed that the District retains all of its powers and authority to direct,<br/>manage and control to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>The exercise of the foregoing powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities by the District,<br/>the adoption of policies, rules, regulations, and practices in furtherance thereof, and the use of<br/>judgment and discretion in connection therewith, shall be limited only by the law and the terms<br/>of this Agreement, and then only to the extent such specific and express terms are in<br/>conformance with law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI<br/>GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>Section 1 - Definitions</p>
<p>A &quot;grievance&quot; is a formal written claim by a grievant that he/she has been affected by a violation,<br/>misapplication or misinterpretation of the specific provisions of this Agreement. The object of<br/>this article is to resolve grievances at the lowest level possible.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>A &quot;grievant&quot; may be any member of the unit or the Association.</p>
<p>An &quot;aggrieved person&quot; is the person or persons making the claim.</p>
<p>A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the District Administration Office is open for business.</p>
<p>Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits specified<br/>at each level should be considered to be maximums and every effort should be made to expedite<br/>the process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance will be<br/>filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in a personnel file of any of the participants.</p>
<p>Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents will be prepared jointly by the Superintendent<br/>and the Association and given appropriate distribution in order to facilitate operation of the<br/>grievance procedure. The costs of preparing forms shall be borne by the District.</p>
<p>The &quot;immediate administrator&quot; is the site principal who has been designated to administer<br/>grievances and who has immediate jurisdiction over the grievant.</p>
<p>The association may file a grievance at the informal level or Level I on behalf of an individual(s)<br/>at the same site or at Level II, if so desired, if grievants are from more than one site or multiple<br/>grievants at the same site.</p>
<p>Section 2 - Preliminary Informal Resolution</p>
<p>Any employee who believes he/she has a grievance shall present the evidence orally to the<br/>immediate administrator within five (5) days after the employee knew, or reasonably should have<br/>known, of the circumstances which form the basis for the alleged grievance. Failure to do so will<br/>render the alleged grievance null and void. The Administrator shall hold discussions and attempt<br/>to resolve the matter within three (3) days after the presentation of such evidence. It is the intent<br/>of this informal meeting that at least one personal conference be held between the employee and<br/>the immediate administrator.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Formal Level</p>
<p>LEVEL I</p>
<p>If the grievance has not been resolved at the preliminary informal level, the grievant must present<br/>his/her grievance in writing on a form provided by the District to his/her immediate administrator<br/>within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance.<br/>Failure to do so will render the grievance null and void. A unit member serving in a year-round<br/>school program during any of the months of June, July, and/or August shall present his or her<br/>grievance in writing within a thirty (30) day period after the occurrence of the act or omission<br/>giving rise to the grievance. This time-line may be extended by mutual written agreement. <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>6</p>
<p>The statement shall include the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A concise statement of the grievance including reference to the specific Article<br/>and Section of the Agreement deemed to be violated, misapplied or<br/>misinterpreted.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue to be resolved.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances involved.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision rendered by the informal conference.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The administrator shall communicate his/her decision within ten (10) days after receiving the<br/>grievance. Decisions will be in writing setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore and<br/>will be transmitted promptly to all parties in interest and to the president of the Association. If<br/>the administrator does not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next<br/>level. Time limits for appeal shall begin the day following receipt of written decision by the<br/>parties in interest. Within the above time limits either party may request a personal conference.<br/>A unit member may be accompanied by an Association representative at the personal conference.<br/>The administrator will advise the grievant of this right at the time of the request.</p>
<p>LEVEL II</p>
<p>If not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the grievant may appeal the decision within ten (10)<br/>days either by:</p>
<p>A. Submitting a statement on a form provided by the District to the Associate</p>
<p>Superintendent, Human Resources &amp; Administration, for the purpose of seeking<br/>resolution through the Interest-Based (CFIER) Process between the Teachers’<br/>Association and District management, or</p>
<p>The statement shall include a copy of the original grievance which is to include<br/>the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A concise statement of the grievance including references to the<br/>specific Article and Section of the Agreement deemed to be<br/>violated, misapplied or misinterpreted.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue to be resolved.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances involved.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision rendered at Level I.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear, concise statement of the reasons for the appeal to Level II.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>B. Proceeding to Level III</p>
<p>Failure to do so will render the grievance null and void.</p>
<p>Through the Interest-Based Process a decision will be issued within a mutually agreed upon time<br/>frame. Decisions will be in writing setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore and will<br/>be transmitted promptly to all parties in interest and to the president of the Association. If the<br/>grievant does not agree with either the decision reached through Interest-Based Process or the<br/>time line as established by the CFIER group, the grievant may appeal to the next level. Time<br/>limits for appeal shall begin the day following receipt of written decision by the parties in<br/>interest.</p>
<p>LEVEL III</p>
<p>If not satisfied with the decision at Level II, or if the grievant does not elect to utilize Level II, the<br/>grievant may appeal the decision by submitting a statement on a form provided by the District to<br/>the Superintendent within ten (10) days. Failure to do so will render the grievance null and void.</p>
<p>This statement shall include a copy of the original grievance which is to include the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A concise statement of the grievance including references to the specific Article<br/>and Section of the Agreement deemed to be violated, misapplied or<br/>misinterpreted.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue to be resolved.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circumstances involved.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision rendered at Level I.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear, concise statement of the reasons for the appeal to Level II.</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall communicate his/her decision within ten (10) days after receiving the<br/>grievance. Decisions will be in writing setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore and<br/>will be transmitted promptly to all parties in interest and to the president of the Association. If<br/>the administrator does not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next<br/>level. Time limits for appeal shall begin the day following receipt of written decision by the<br/>parties in interest.</p>
<p>LEVEL IV</p>
<p>If not satisfied with the decision at Level III, the grievant may, within ten (10) days, submit a<br/>written request for mediation of the grievance. In this event the Association shall, within five (5)<br/>days, submit to the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service a written request for the</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>immediate services of a mediator.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the mediator shall be to assist the parties to achieve a mutually<br/>satisfactory resolution of the grievance. At the outset of this process, the mediator<br/>shall schedule a meeting at a mutually agreeable time for the purpose of resolving<br/>the matter through mediation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is achieved by means of this mediation<br/>process, both parties to the grievance shall sign a written statement to that effect,<br/>and thus waive the right of either party to any further appeal of the grievance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association have agreed that Level III may be waived by<br/>mutual agreement.</p>
<p>LEVEL V</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the results of the Level IV mediation process, he/she may,<br/>with the prior written approval of the Association, within twenty (20) days of the final meeting<br/>with the mediator, request in writing that the grievance by submitted to binding arbitration. If<br/>any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such question will be ruled upon by<br/>the arbitrator only after he/she has had an opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs for services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, travel and<br/>sustenance expenses, if any, shall be shared equally by the District and<br/>Association. The District shall provide a hearing room in the District at no<br/>expense to either party. If the arbitrator requests use of a reporter and/or<br/>transcripts, the parties shall split the costs. If the District requests use of a<br/>reporter and/or transcripts, the District shall assume the costs unless the parties<br/>mutually agree to an equal split. If the Association requests use of a reporter<br/>and/or transcripts, the Association shall assume the costs unless the parties<br/>mutually agree to any equal split. Otherwise, each party shall assume the expense<br/>of the presentation of its own case.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the grievance has been considered by the parties in the preceding<br/>steps the grievance shall not constitute a waiver of jurisdiction limitations upon<br/>the arbitrator in this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall select a mutually agreeable arbitrator who must be willing to<br/>hold the arbitration hearing in the District. Should they be unable to agree on an<br/>arbitrator within five (5) working days of the Associations' submission of the<br/>grievance to arbitration, an arbitrator shall be selected from a list of five (5)<br/>arbitrators provided by the American Arbitration Association, by alternate striking<br/>of names until one name remains. The party who strikes the first name shall be<br/>determined by the Association striking first on all even numbered grievances and<br/>the District striking first on all odd numbered grievances.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth his/her findings of<br/>fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator will be</p>
<p>without power or authority to make any decision which requires the commission<br/>of an act prohibited by law, which is violative of the terms of this Agreement, or<br/>to change any of the Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is<br/>empowered to include in any award such financial reimbursement or remedy as is<br/>requested in the party's submission statement.</p>
<p>5. The decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the Superintendent and the<br/>Association and will be binding upon the parties.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Salaries</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>SALARIES AND FRINGE BENEFITS</p>
<p>The District agrees to the following for salaries:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the unit shall be placed on applicable step and class increments of the</p>
<p>salary schedule (see Appendix A). Unit members working on the Orchard Plan<br/>shall be placed on applicable range of an extended year salary schedule. The State<br/>COLA percent increase shall be applied to the salary schedule each year of this<br/>contract as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall calculate a one percent (1%) increase to the<br/>certificated salary schedule as of June 1<sup>st</sup> of each year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated salary schedule shall be increased by the State<br/>COLA by July 1<sup>st</sup> of that school year. Should the Governor and<br/>Legislature not adopt a final State budget by July 1<sup>st</sup> of that school<br/>year, the above computations and adjustment shall be made as soon<br/>as possible following such adoption, and the salary schedule<br/>increase shall be made retroactive to July 1<sup>st</sup> of the school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formula for Establishing COLA for Each Year, Beginning with 1990-1991<br/>School Year: The District and OETA will yearly agree as to the State statutory<br/>COLA and actual State-funded COLA for each year. Both groups acknowledge<br/>that the difference between the statutory COLA and State-funded COLA is the<br/>amount deficited. It is understood that the statutory COLA, funded COLA, and<br/>deficited amounts will fluctuate with the State economy and will be altered by the<br/>State. It is also understood that as the economy improves, the deficited amounts<br/>may be repaid to the District by the State.</p>
<p>The yearly COLA which is adjusted on the certificated salary schedules for unit<br/>members will be determined by the actual funded COLA by the State, which<br/>equals the statutory COLA multiplied by the State deficit factor. As COLAs are<br/>applied to the certificated salary schedules and the percentage funded is adjusted <sup>10</sup></p>
<p>10</p>
<p>upward or downward later by the State, the salary schedule shall also be adjusted,<br/>provided the total adjustments are greater than 0.25%. If the total adjustments<br/>are less than 0.25%, then the adjustments will be held to the following adjustment<br/>period. The adjustments will occur annually on June 1, to be paid to unit<br/>members by June 30.</p>
<p>The Oroville Elementary School District shall maintain a ledger, with copies for<br/>the Association, which sets forth the statutory COLA, the State-funded COLA<br/>(the deficited COLA), and all funds sent to the District to repay the deficits.</p>
<p>Negotiated language and salary schedules for the years 1989-1990 through the<br/>current year's schedules shall be included in the CFIER Budget Committee's<br/>documentation.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the State COLA approach to determining basic percentage<br/>increases in State funding for public school districts be<br/>legislatively altered or abandoned during the period of this<br/>Agreement and be replaced by a different funding approach, then<br/>the parties agree to meet and negotiate an agreement as to a<br/>comparable replacement computation for the above formula. If no<br/>agreement is reached, impasse may be declared and the matter<br/>submitted to mediation through PERB.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 1996-1997 School Year:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will implement a revised certificated salary schedule,<br/>retroactive to July 1, 1996. The new salary schedule includes application<br/>of the COLA for the 1996-1997 School Year, incorporating revisions to<br/>more fairly represent the certificated employees' salaries when compared<br/>to the comparable group of school districts' salary schedules.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to apply the current year COLA to the psychologists'<br/>salary schedule and to the extra-duty pay stipends, retroactive to July 1,<br/>1996.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agree that if additional funding is received by the District as<br/>additional deficit reduction funding or equalization funding for the 1996-<br/>1997 School Year, the parties agree to further negotiate compensation. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agree that salary schedule benchmarks need to be set for<br/>comparison purposes with other comparable districts' salary schedules<br/>before the conclusion of spring, 1997, negotiations.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 1997-1998 School Year:</p>
<p>1. The District will implement a revised certificated salary schedule<br/>retroactive to July 1,1997. The new salary schedule incorporates</p>
<p>adjustments which will allow the District to rank favorably at all four<br/>benchmarks with the eleven comparable districts. The adjustment equates<br/>to a 3.76% increase (current cost $291,354).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will apply a 3.81% COLA ($299,466 for the current year) to<br/>the restructured certificated salary schedules.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A separate schedule for nurses, identical in structure to the previous<br/>certificated salary schedule, will be effective as of July 1,1997.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new teachers' salary schedule will delete Class II (B.A. +15 units) as<br/>used in previous schedules.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other salary adjustments (such as stipends and extra duty pay) will be<br/>considered until after July 1, 1998.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Butte County Health JPA issue will continue to be discussed in future<br/>negotiations.</p>
<p>The COLA for the 2000-2001 School Year shall be 10.166%. This percentage<br/>includes a 3.17% COLA from the State plus a 6.99% COLA adjustment which<br/>reflects the State's elimination of the 6.99% deficit reduction.</p>
<p>The minimum teacher's salary shall be $34,000 for Column III, Step 1 of the<br/>certificated salary schedule for the 2000-2001 School Year. A &quot;shadow schedule&quot;<br/>shall be maintained, with a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) attached to Column<br/>III, Step 1, as if no beginning teachers’ salary schedule was approved. The<br/>&quot;shadow schedule&quot; will have COLA attached starting with the 1999-2000 School<br/>Year. Then, once the &quot;shadow schedule&quot; COLA for Column III, Step 1, exceeds<br/>the base minimum teachers' salary, the higher salary shown in the &quot;shadow<br/>schedule&quot; will then be paid to unit members who are placed in the affected cells.</p>
<p>The COLA shall be paid on a retroactive basis to July 1,2000. The pay warrant<br/>on September 30,2000 will include the new COLA as applied to the previous<br/>1999-2000 School Year schedule. The pay warrant on October 31,2000 will<br/>include the retroactive payments to employees who taught in year-round schools<br/>during the months of July and August. All other pay adjustments will be complete<br/>by November 30,2000.</p>
<p>For the 2001-2002 School Year, the District shall grant a 3.87% COLA applied to<br/>all certificated salary schedules and to the extra duty salary schedule effective<br/>July 1,2001.</p>
<p>For the 2002-2003 School Year, the District will apply a 2.0% COLA to the<br/>certificated salary schedules, retroactive to July 1,2002.</p>
<p>Agreement Concerning the 1.2% Deficited Base Revenue Limit in the 2003-2004</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Fiscal Year:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to absorb the 1.2% deficit to the District base revenue<br/>limit for the 2003-2004 School Year only, as a one-time expense;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the 1.2% deficit to the District base revenue limit<br/>which occurred in the 2003-2004 School Year will be offset in the 2004-<br/>2005 School Year by using State-funded dollars in the following order:</p>
<p>First, use deficit reduction funding; then.</p>
<p>Second, use equalization funding; and then.</p>
<p>Third, use State-funded COLA</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the combination of State funds discussed in paragraph 2 above do not<br/>cover the 1.2% deficit reduction in the 2004-2005 School Year, both<br/>parties agree to return to the table to discuss other resolutions to the issue;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future negotiations shall continue to clarify contract language which<br/>addresses how the parties should handle changes in State funding, such<br/>as cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) and base revenue limit</p>
<p>m. For the 2004-2005 School Year:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to adjust the certificated salary schedule by<br/>2.08%, retroactively to July 1,2004;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the State’s equalization adjustment to the District’s<br/>revenue limit for the current 2004-2005 School Year is not yet known for<br/>certain; therefore, when equalization adjustment is known in or around<br/>March, 2005, the District will quantify the adjustment as a percentage (%)<br/>of COLA. If the equalization adjustment is equal to 0.25% or greater, an<br/>additional COLA adjustment will be made to the certificated salary<br/>schedule for the 2004-2005 School Year, retroactive to July 1, 2004.</p>
<p>If the equalization adjustment is less than 0.25%, then the adjustment will<br/>be added to the normal cost-of-living adjustment for the 2005-2006 School<br/>Year and applied to the certificated salary schedule at that time;</p>
<p>3. The parties acknowledge that there exists a deficit of approximately 1.86%<br/>unfunded COLA for the 2003-2004 School Year and a 0.3% deficit of the<br/>revenue limit from the 2003-2004 School Year which has not been<br/>included in the current year COLA. At which time the State restores<br/>these deficits, they will be the subject of future salary schedule<br/>adjustments, as negotiated between the parties. The District will continue<br/>to chart the State allocations, COLA’s, and State deficits to preserve this</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>agreement.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Schedule Adjustment for 2004-2005:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa result of a Salary and Benefit Report (SABRE) of comparable school<br/>districts, and the specific analysis of four benchmarks on the certificated<br/>salary schedule, the parties agree that the maximum scheduled salary on the<br/>schedule (Class VI, Step 30) should be increased by $100.00 per year;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a salary schedule adjustment to Class VI, Step 30, of the<br/>certificated salary schedule of $100.00 shall be initiated, effective retroactive<br/>to July 1, 2004.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding equalization funding for fiscal year 2004-2005, the District<br/>adjusted the salary for all unit members by 0.25% retroactively effective<br/>as of July 1, 2004 for the purpose of granting equalization aide, equivalent<br/>to a 0.25% COLA.</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2005-2006 School Year, the District will apply a 5.5% cost-of-living<br/>adjustment to the certificated salary schedule, the certificated nurses’ salary<br/>schedule, the school psychologists’ salary schedule, and the extra duty/coaching<br/>salary stipends for the 2005-2006 School Year, retroactively, effective July 1,2005.</p>
<p>p. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2006-2007 School Year, the parties agree that the State of California has<br/>provided on-going funding which will increase the District’s revenue limit and<br/>provide an equivalent cost-of-living adjustment as presented below:</p>
<p>Cost-of-Living Adjustment for the 2006-2007 Fiscal Year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.92%</p>
<p>Deficit Reduction of Cost-of-Living Adjustment from</p>
<p>Previous Fiscal Years &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.92%</p>
<p>Equalization Adjustment to the District’s Revenue Limit</p>
<p>(One-Half of the Projected Equalization Adjustment, Which</p>
<p>Will be Verified by the Parties in May, 2007) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.35%</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the three sources of revenue limit adjustments, as<br/>presented above, when put together amount to a 7.18% cost-of-living adjust¬<br/>ment. This adjustment shall be applied to the certificated salary schedule, the<br/>certificated nurses ‘salary schedule, the school psychologists’ salary schedule<br/>and the extra-duty/coaching salary stipends for the 2006-2007 School Year,<br/>retroactively, effective July 1,2006.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of the equalization adjustment shall be verified in May, 2007<br/>and then be added to the June, 2007 pay warrants provided the remainder is</p>
<p>0.25% or greater. If the remainder is less than 0.25%, the adjustment to the<br/>salary schedules shall be held and included in the 2007-2008 salary schedule</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>adjustments, in which case, it will be effective July 1, 2007.</p>
<p>q. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2007-2008 School Year, the parties agree that the State of California has<br/>provided on-going funding which will increase the District’s revenue limit and<br/>provide an equivalent cost-of-living adjustment as presented below:</p>
<p>Cost-of-Living Adjustment for the 2007-2008 Fiscal Year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.53%</p>
<p>Remaining Equalization Adjustment to the District’s Revenue<br/>Limit (Second-Half of the Equalization Adjustment, Per Side<br/>Letter of September 11, 2006) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.31%</p>
<p>1. The parties agree that the two sources of revenue limit adjustments, as</p>
<p>presented above, when put together amount to a 4.84% cost-of-living adjust¬<br/>ment. This adjustment shall be applied to the certificated salary schedule, the<br/>certificated nurses’ salary schedule, the school psychologists’ salary schedule<br/>and the extra-duty/coaching salary stipends for the 2007-2008 School Year,<br/>retroactively, effective July 1, 2007.</p>
<p>r. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District and OETA to be at least the sixth highest district out of<br/>twelve districts at the agreed upon benchmarks listed below (item ‘s’). Each fall,<br/>OETA and the District agree to use the School Services SABRE and CADIE reports<br/>to check agreed-upon benchmark comparison points. A benchmark test fails only if it<br/>is not at least in the sixth highest place. If the certificated salary schedule fails a<br/>benchmark comparison point, the District agrees to negotiate additional monies for a<br/>benchmark adjustment. No benchmark adjustment is needed when benchmark goals<br/>are met.</p>
<p>s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benchmarks for comparison with the twelve districts shall be:</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maximum scheduled salary (Class VI, Step 30)</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BA, plus 60 units, step 20</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BA, plus 60 units, step 10</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowest scheduled salary</p>
<p>For the 2001-2002 School Year, the salary schedule for the maximum salary<br/>benchmark (BA + 75 units, step 30) shall be increased by $800. The placement<br/>on the certificated salary schedule, which has been altered due to this adjustment,<br/>shall be shaded on the salary schedule to indicate that the placement has an<br/>adjustment in addition to the normal percentage applied to the salary schedule.</p>
<p>t. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OETA and the District agree to use the following school districts for the purposes<br/>of salary schedule comparisons: Auburn Union Elementary (Placer County);</p>
<p>Cascade Union Elementary (Shasta County); Coming Union Elementary (Tehama<br/>County); Enterprise Elementary (Shasta County); Grass Valley Elementary<br/>(Nevada County); Loomis Union Elementary (Placer County); Palermo Union<br/>School District (Butte County); Pleasant Ridge Union Elementary (Nevada<br/>County); Red Bluff Union Elementary (Tehama County); Redding Elementary</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>(Shasta County); Robla Elementary (Sacramento County).</p>
<p>OETA and the District agree to periodically check the comparability of the twelve<br/>districts every three years beginning in the year 2000. The next check will be in<br/>the 2014-2015 School Year. Comparable districts will be chosen using these<br/>guidelines:</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base Revenue Limit within $100 of OESD</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closest enrollments to OESD</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary districts</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geographically, Sacramento County to the Oregon border, east of the<br/>Coastal Range</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for service outside the District shall be allowed on the salary schedule at<br/>the rate of one increment (step) for one (1) year of comparable service up to a<br/>maximum of six (6) increments. Private school experience for step increment on<br/>the salary schedule will be accepted, providing the private school was state<br/>accredited, the educational program was equal to that which was carried out in the<br/>public schools and the teacher in question held a valid credential at the time of<br/>teaching.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All course work approved for initial placement must be verified by official<br/>transcripts. Obtaining official transcripts is the responsibility of the teacher. All<br/>transcript verification must be received within thirty (30) days of the signing of<br/>the teacher's initial contract. Failure to do so will result in the District's<br/>withholding of salary warrants until such documents are placed on file.</p>
<p>Earned degrees received and units of study in an accredited institution of higher<br/>learning shall be allowed for initial placement and subsequent horizontal<br/>movement on the salary schedule. In cases where courses are taken which are<br/>deemed by the college or university to be applicable to a graduate degree, but are<br/>completed prior to completion of, and were not counted toward attainment of the</p>
<p>Bachelors Degree, shall be considered for salary placement as though they had<br/>been completed subsequent to the granting of the Bachelors Degree. Such<br/>conditions must be verified through official transcripts or other suitable proof. All<br/>other units earned prior to Bachelors Degree shall not be considered for salary<br/>placement. The accreditation status of a college, university or private school at<br/>the time of the teacher's enrollment shall prevail. Previous or subsequent<br/>accreditation shall not be considered.</p>
<p>Teachers who resign from the District and are subsequently reemployed will be<br/>placed on the salary schedule in a position no higher than the seventh step, their<br/>previous experience notwithstanding. However, tenured teachers who resign and<br/>are subsequently reemployed within thirty-nine (39) calendar months from the<br/>time of resignation shall be restored to their previous schedule status.</p>
<p>Teachers whose initial District employment was in programs conducted under</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>contract with public or private agencies or other categorically-funded projects, and<br/>who are subsequently employed as probationary teachers with no break in service,<br/>shall be credited with the time served in the specially-funded program for salary<br/>schedule placement and advancement purposes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in the 2002-2003 school year, certificated staff who teach on a<br/>traditional school schedule will have the option to receive their annual<br/>salary in either eleven (11) equal pay warrants, or twelve (12) equal pay<br/>warrants, at each unit member’s preference;</p>
<p>Unit members who desire to have pay warrants issued in eleven (11) payments shall<br/>receive the first warrant at the end of August and the eleventh (11<sup>th</sup>) warrant at the end of<br/>June in the year of service;</p>
<p>Unit members who desire to have pay warrants issued in twelve (12) payments<br/>shall receive the first warrant at the end of August and the twelfth (12<sup>th</sup>) warrant at<br/>the end of July in the year of service.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertical Movement</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>Full-time Equivalent: Employees who work more than 75% of the school year and at</p>
<p>least 75% of the contract hours.</p>
<p>Part-time: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;75%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contract&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work</p>
<p>hours in a school year.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers shall advance one vertical step on the salary schedule<br/>for each year of service, except those whose placement is at the<br/>maximum step for their class, or whose contract is limited by<br/>special conditions usually identified with specially-funded program<br/>employment. A year of service is defined as the teacher having<br/>paid status for at least seventy-five (75) percent of the work hours<br/>designated for the position.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All part-time unit members (not full-time equivalent) working at<br/>least 75% of their contracted work hours in a School Year will be<br/>moved on the salary schedule yearly, proportionate to their part-<br/>time assignment, rounded to the nearest tenth, (i.e. a 33% fiill-time<br/>equivalent position earns 30% of the appropriate step<br/>advancement. Step advancement under this provision is<br/>cumulative.) Current unit members will be grandfathered so they<br/>will not adversely suffer for the 1992-1993 school year. Unit<br/>members, if eligible, will be upgraded back to the 1989-1990<br/>school year in salary and schedule placement. This provision is</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>effective as of July 1, 1992 for all unit members employed on or<br/>after that time.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agree that the District will assign all certificated personnel to full year<br/>placement on the certificated salary schedule by rounding years of service to<br/>nearest full year step placement with service credit of 0.50 and above being<br/>rounded up and with service credit less than 0.50 being rounded down. It is the<br/>District’s intent to continue to recalculate accrued service credit on a yearly basis<br/>and then to place certificated employees based upon rounding up or down when<br/>the previous year's service credit does not represent full year service.</p>
<p>This provision is effective as of July 1,1996 for all unit members.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who have been employed in the regular education<br/>program of the District as probationary or permanent members<br/>before being subsequently assigned to programs conducted under<br/>contract with public or private agencies or other categorically-<br/>funded projects will be entitled to continue vertical advancement<br/>on the salary schedule for service while assigned to such restricted<br/>programs.</p>
<p>6. Horizontal Movement</p>
<p>Course credit for salary placement and movement shall be given only for post-graduate,<br/>upper division or graduate course work taken at four-year colleges, universities or</p>
<p>graduate schools which are accredited by a regional accrediting commission.</p>
<p>Semester hours (units) as defined by the particular accredited college or university will<br/>be acceptable for placement on the salary schedule. Quarter hour units are converted<br/>to semester units by multiplying the total of such quarter units by two-thirds.</p>
<p>Teachers requesting reclassification from one class to another must file such<br/>request with the District office no later than June 15. All course work must be<br/>completed by September 1st to apply for the current school year.</p>
<p>Supporting records or transcripts verifying post-graduate units of study that are to<br/>apply toward such a reclassification must be filed with the District office not later<br/>than September 15. If by September 15 the teacher is unable to submit supporting<br/>records or transcripts verifying post-graduate units of study which are to apply<br/>toward reclassification, official notice in the form of a grade card or letter from<br/>the college or university shall be submitted. Such temporary verifications which<br/>indicate satisfactory completion of the course(s) shall be sufficient evidence to<br/>meet the above requirements. The teacher shall provide the official transcript or<br/>affidavit documents to the District as soon as it becomes available, but no later<br/>than December 30.</p>
<p>The burden of proof of training, experience, possession of credentials and other</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>required documents shall lie with the teacher, both for initial placement and for<br/>subsequent reclassification. Any error in classification shall be corrected as soon<br/>as the error is verified. Audit courses will not be accepted as credits valid for<br/>salary schedule placement or reclassification. Credit will not be accepted for<br/>course work taken in the armed services, except as it was taken in conjunction<br/>with an accredited college or university and can be verified through official<br/>transcripts.</p>
<p>Course work taken through a foreign university or other institution which sponsors travel<br/>tours for credits must be assigned upper division or graduate status, assigned a course<br/>title, and given unit value. Such foreign university or other institution must be listed in<br/>the current edition of accredited institutions of higher learning or one of its regional<br/>accrediting commissions.</p>
<p>If a teacher believes that participation in a lower division course will benefit his or her<br/>teaching program and that a similar benefit is not available at an upper division or<br/>graduate course level, such teacher may petition the District for a waiver. Such waiver, if<br/>granted, would allow the units so approved to be counted for advancement on the salary<br/>schedule. Prior to the date of enrollment in lower division courses, the teacher must<br/>make formal application to the District and receive approval in the form of the<br/>aforementioned waiver.</p>
<p>The professional development course IS824A, offered through California State<br/>University, Chico, may be taken for salary advancement purposes up to a maximum<br/>of three units. This course is given in single unit increments through the Butte County<br/>Office of Education and is referred to as Staff Development Audiovisual Preview and<br/>Evaluation.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special increment of $800 shall be granted to the unit members possessing a<br/>Master of Arts degree from an accredited college or university, limited to one such<br/>degree.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special longevity increment of two and two tenths percent (2.2%) of the base<br/>salary shall be granted to unit members at step 20, an additional two percent<br/>(2.0%) for a total of four and two tenths percent (4.2%) of the base salary shall be<br/>granted to unit members at step 25, and an additional two percent (2.0%) for a<br/>total of six and two tenths percent (6.2%) of the base salary shall be granted to<br/>unit members at step 30.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longevity Stipends for School Psychologists</p>
<p>The parties agree that a school psychologist shall receive a 2.0% longevity<br/>stipend upon his/her 20<sup>th</sup> year in the District, a 4.0% longevity stipend upon<br/>his/her 25<sup>th</sup> year in the District, and a 6.0% longevity stipend upon his/her 30<sup>th<br/></sup>year in the District;</p>
<p>The longevity stipends for school psychologists shall begin in the 2004-2005 School</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Year, and shall be effective retroactively to July 1, 2004;</p>
<p>Longevity stipends shall be calculated on a percentage of the school psychologist’s<br/>base salary for each level of longevity.</p>
<p>10. Applicable service with another district shall not exceed a total of ten (10) years<br/>for longevity purposes.</p>

<p>Cross Country Coach’s Stipend at Middle School Level</p>
<p>The parties agree that the cross country coach at the middle school<br/>level should be upgraded to a level equal to the track coach at the<br/>middle school level, due to the total number of cross country meets<br/>and number of out-of-town meets;</p>
<p>The cross country coach stipend for the 2004-2005 School Year shall<br/>be established at $467.00 for the season, retroactive to July 1, 2004;</p>

Any classroom teacher performing such duty shall be compensated at<br/>the rate of $20.00 per hour/period provided that a minimum of one hour/period of<br/>service is provided. At the option of the classroom teacher, compensatory time<br/>may be used in lieu of monetary compensation. In this regard, six periods or six<br/>hours of service will equal one day of compensatory time off.</p>
<p>Unit members shall be paid $20.00 per hour to a maximum of $120 per day for pre¬<br/>approved extra work, including District-approved workshops.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member possesses a California administrative credential and is designated<br/>by the District to substitute for a site-level administrator, in lieu of their regular<br/>rate of pay, the unit member shall receive the Step 1 daily rate of pay for whom<br/>the unit member is a substitute, or their daily rate of pay times 1.05, whichever is<br/>greater.

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a unit member receives a monetary stipend for attending staff<br/>development activities during the contracted workday, $100.00 per day will be<br/>deducted from the stipends received to reimburse the District for costs associated<br/>with substitutes and employee salary-related expenses. The balance of the stipend<br/>will be used for classroom supplies and materials specifically for classroom use;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a stipend is given to a unit member for a staff development activity that<br/>involves both contracted hours and noncontracted hours, $100.00 per day of<br/>contracted workdays or portion thereof will be deducted from the stipends<br/>received to reimburse the District for costs associated with substitutes and<br/>employee salary-related expenses;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When completing the Conference/Workshop/Institute Application form, if a unit<br/>member does not believe that a category fits his/her specific situation, he/she may<br/>request that the application be given special consideration.

<p>Section 2 - Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>The District agrees to maintain the following fringe benefits for the 1997-1998 School<br/>Year.</p>
<p>1. A. The District standard for fringe benefits in the 1997-1998 School Year for full¬<br/>time employees (more than 75% full-time equivalent status) will be:</p>
<p>Blue Cross Prudent Buyer Classic III<br/>Delta Dental Plan</p>
<p>Vision Service Plan B, $15 deductible</p>
<p>The above programs will cover employees and eligible dependents and<br/>will be District-paid. Should the Butte Schools Self-Funded Programs<br/>JPA Board discontinue the Blue Cross Classic III program due to lack of<br/>sufficient participation, the parties shall meet and negotiate alternative<br/>medical coverage.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who desire a more expensive medical plan than the District<br/>standard may select the more expensive plan and pay the added monthly<br/>premium costs beyond the $392 District monthly contribution.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who desire a less expensive Blue Cross medical plan than<br/>the District standard may select the less expensive plan and place the<br/>savings in a tax-sheltered 125 plan, receiving the difference between the<br/>selected plan and the District-paid premium of $392 per month.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will pay the full cost of the above programs, for the 1997-1998<br/>School Year, during the contract term for all full-time unit members.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may change the insurance carrier after consulting with OETA,<br/>provided no change in benefits, if the premium increase exceeds ten percent<br/>(10%) in one year, or if Blue Cross Classic III coverage is terminated by the<br/>provider or the Joint Powers Authority. If a package of health benefits is deemed<br/>more favorable than the existing Butte Schools Self-funded Programs Joint<br/>Powers Agreement offers, it may be considered through the mutual consent of<br/>both parties provided agreement is reached and the Butte Schools Self-funded<br/>Programs Joint Powers Agreement is notified prior to March 1,1999.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employee contributions for health care premiums will be made with pre-tax<br/>dollars.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may elect to participate in an Internal Revenue Service Section 125<br/>plan with a mutually agreed upon provider.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may re-open this section of the contract if any change in Federal or</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>State law adversely affects the elements of the benefits package.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any portion of the District contribution for health coverage remaining after the</p>
<p>employee has selected a coverage option will be placed in an Internal Revenue<br/>Service 125 Plan or Tax Deferred Annuity at the employee's option.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall commit for the term of the contract a pro-rated amount based<br/>upon the percentage of time a part-time unit member serves in relation to a full¬<br/>time employee for each part-time unit member to participate in the fringe benefit<br/>plans.</p>
<p>Each part-time unit member may choose one of the following:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participate in the entire package by remitting to the District in pre-tax dollars the<br/>difference between the premiums and the pro-rata District contribution.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waive participation in the dental and/or vision plans and have the District<br/>contribute the pro-rata amount for either the Blue Cross Prudent Buyer Option 1<br/>or Option 2, Blue Cross Classic II or III or Foundation HMO and dental or vision<br/>plans.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elect vision and/or dental plan coverage and waive coverage provided the unit<br/>member presents evidence of medical health coverage by another major medical<br/>plan to the satisfaction of the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>Any portion of the District contribution for health coverage remaining after the employee<br/>has selected a coverage option will be placed in an Internal Revenue Service 125 Plan or<br/>Tax Deferred Annuity at the employee's option.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide $475 per month premium per unit member for the 2000-</p>
<p>2001 School Year. Increases to the premium for future years will be negotiated.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OETA will endeavor to educate unit members on the rising cost of<br/>pharmaceuticals and encourage unit members to consider mail order<br/>pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to increase the Delta Dental coverage for OETA unit members<br/>from the basic $1,000.00 annual maximum (JPA Plan 1 A) to the basic $2,000.00<br/>annual maximum benefit (JPA Plan 2A) effective November 1, 1999. This<br/>coverage is a composite benefit which applies to the unit member and all<br/>qualifying family members. The added cost for the enhanced dental coverage<br/>benefit shall be deducted monthly from qualifying OETA unit member's pay<br/>warrants.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2001-2002 School Year, the District standard for health benefits shall be the Blue<br/>Cross Option I Plan as provided by the Butte Schools Self-Insured Schools JPA, with the<br/>following co-pay on pharmaceuticals:</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>For retail, $5.00 generic / $12.00 brand co-payments; and<br/>For mail order, $2.00 generic / $12.00 brand co-payments</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2001-2002 School Year, unit members will receive maximum<br/>coverage of $2,000 per year dental services by paying $4.00 per month additional<br/>premium.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District standard for health benefits for the 2002-2003 School Year shall be<br/>maintained as the Blue Cross Option I Plan, as provided by the Butte Schools Self-<br/>Insured Schools JPA;</p>
<p>The District will maintain the current vision plan and current dental plan (based upon a<br/>maximum coverage of $1,000 per year) for the 2002-2003 School Year. Unit members<br/>actually receive a maximum coverage of $2,000 per year dental coverage by paying $4.00<br/>per month additional premium;</p>
<p>The District shall make monthly premium payments of $553.00 per unit member per<br/>month to maintain the Blue Cross Option I Plan coverage for the 2002-2003 School Year.<br/>This reflects an increase of $55.00 per month over the premium rate paid during the<br/>2001-2002 School Year. One-half the premium rate increase ($27.50 per month) to<br/>maintain the Blue Cross Option I Plan as a District standard;</p>
<p>If the State-adopted COLA is less than 0.62%, the parties will meet to decide how the<br/>benefits will be split.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will maintain Blue Cross Option I as the standard for medical coverage for<br/>all certificated staff for the three-year period, beginning July 1,2003;</p>
<p>The District will also maintain Delta Dental coverage for OETA unit members with a<br/>$2,000 maximum usage per year and Vision Plan B, with$15.00 co-pay, as the District<br/>standard for coverage during the three-year period, beginning July 1,2003;</p>
<p>The total premium cost of the medical, dental and vision benefits shall be divided so that<br/>the District will pay 85% of the total costs and OETA unit members will pay 15% of the<br/>total costs.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2006-2007 School Year, the District will provide all full-time unit members with<br/>the Blue Cross Silver Plan as the District standard for medical insurance by paying the<br/>entire monthly premium so unit members will have no out-of-pocket expense for premium<br/>costs;</p>
<p>The current dental and vision coverages for unit members, including the $2,000 annual<br/>limit on dental coverage, will be continued into the 2006-2007 School Year, with the<br/>District paying the entire monthly premium; Unit members may select a medical plan other<br/>then the Blue Cross Silver Plan, thereby experiencing a savings from selecting less costly<br/>programs or incurring a personal cost for selecting a more costly program. Alternate<br/>selections may occur during the open enrollment period;</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>All health plans shall provide coverage for the unit member and the unit member’s<br/>immediate family, within the Butte Schools Self-Funded JPA policies and guidelines;</p>
<p>OETA shall encourage unit members to use mail order pharmaceuticals;</p>
<p>The District and OETA will educate unit members on the beneficial use of Internal<br/>Revenue Code, Section 125 Plans, which provide tax benefits for unit members who<br/>reimburse themselves for medical co-payments, and deductibles out of a defined<br/>individual plan through American Fidelity Insurance;</p>
<p>The parties agree to consider creating a health benefits formula for future benefit<br/>package discussions/agreements.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2007-2008 School Year, the District will maintain the Option 1/Silver Plan as the<br/>primary medical plan. The District will contribute $788.00 per month per full-time equiv-<br/>alert unit member toward payment of the premium;</p>
<p>Unit members will have the option of selecting a medical plan from the four plans offered<br/>by Butte Schools Self-Funded JPA for the 2007-2008 School Year;</p>

<p>Unit members may change their medical plan during the open enrollment period.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2008-2009 School Year, the parties agree to maintain the Option 1/Silver Plan as<br/>the primary medical plan of the District. The District will continue to contribute $788.00<br/>per month per full-time equivalent unit member toward payment of the premium;</p>
<p>Unit members will have the option of selecting a medical plan from the four plans offered<br/>by Butte Schools Self-Funded JPA for the 2008-2009 School Year;</p>

<p>Both OETA and the District agree to research other health plans/options for future years;</p>
<p>Unit members will have the option of selecting a medical plan from the five options offered<br/>by the Butte Schools Self-Funded JPA for the 2009-2019 School Year;</p>
<p>Unit members may change their medical plans during the open enrollment period;</p>
<p>OETA agrees to continue educating unit members regarding mail order prescriptions,<br/>health benefit options and other services offered through the Butte Schools Self-Funded<br/>JPA.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>Section 1-Class Size Reduction</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is currently assigning 20 students to each class in grades kindergarten through<br/>grade three and attempting to maintain a 20 to 1 average per class;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to current State regulations, the District may exceed 20 students per class, provided<br/>the year-long average of students per a single class does not exceed 20.4 students;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is currently assigning the same number of students to combination classes in<br/>grades kindergarten through grade three as in straight classes;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District stops receiving State funding for class size reductions in grades kindergarten<br/>through grade three, or the funding is reduced by the State, or the State alters the formula<br/>for calculating funding incentives for class size reductions or the class size expectations by<br/>the State and/or Board of Trustees is altered, the Board of Trustees may change the current<br/>standard for class size reduction at grades kindergarten through grade three.</p>
<p>Section 2-Class Size Without Class Size Reduction Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree that maintenance of small classes is in the<br/>best interest of the District, and is the continuing goal of both parties.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to maintain the objective of reaching a District-wide<br/>teacher/pupil ratio of no greater than 1:28 in all regular classrooms in grades K-8.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum class size for regular classroom teachers shall not exceed thirty-three<br/>(33) pupils per class in kindergarten classes where the morning and afternoon<br/>teachers team teach; thirty (30) pupils in grades 1-3 and kindergarten classes<br/>which do not participate in team teaching (thirty-one (31) with teacher option);<br/>thirty-one (31) pupils in grades 4-6 (thirty-two (32) with teacher option).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. There shall be a class size limit on District kindergarten classes as follows:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students shall be the limit when the kindergarten teacher has a teacher</p>
<p>partner for the entire portion of the School Year when the class is in session;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students shall be the limit, unless the teacher volunteers to take an</p>
<p>additional student, when the kindergarten teacher has a teacher partner for at<br/>least 66% of the School Year when the class is in session;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students shall be the limit, unless the teacher volunteers to take an</p>
<p>additional student, when the kindergarten teacher has a teacher partner for at</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>least 33% of the School Year when the class is in session; and,</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 students shall be the limit, unless the teacher volunteers to take an</p>
<p>additional student, when the kindergarten teacher has no teacher partner.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anytime a kindergarten teacher has more than 30 students assigned to the class,<br/>the teacher will have a minimum of a three-hour instructional aide assigned to the<br/>class on days when a teacher partner is not scheduled to teach, i.e. the teacher<br/>partner is off track.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For year-round schools where the kindergarten teacher does not track on and off<br/>with students, the class size formula will be determined by the maximum number<br/>of students the teacher teaches on any one day except on common days (when all<br/>tracks of students are present).</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever this class size option becomes effective, no student will be removed<br/>from the current classroom, except by normal attrition.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination classes shall have a pupil load of three (3) pupils less than non¬<br/>combination classes at the same grade levels in the school where combination<br/>classes exist.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grades 7-8 at Central and Ishi Hills Middle Schools, excluding Physical Education<br/>classes, the District agrees to maintain a 28.3 per class average, with no more than 32<br/>students per class and 170 per day maximum individual student contacts per unit member.<br/>Physical Education classes shall not exceed 40 students per class, and 220 per day<br/>maximum individual student contacts per unit member.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where classes exceed individual maximums, as set forth above, the District will make<br/>&quot;good faith&quot; efforts to alleviate the overload through the use of voluntary leveling of<br/>classes, busing or creation of combination classes.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievement of the above class size ratios and maximums is expressly contingent upon<br/>sufficient appropriate classrooms and school facilities.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the State Legislature enacts funding incentives for the reduction of class<br/>sizes, all such funds shall be used for that exclusive purpose.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is currently assigning 20 students to each class in grades kindergarten<br/>through grade three with the intent to maintain a 20 to 1 average per class;</p>
<p>Pursuant to current State regulations, the District may exceed 20 students per class,<br/>provided the year-long average of students per a single class does not exceed 20.4 students;</p>
<p>The District is currently assigning the same number of students to combination classes<br/>in grades kindergarten through grade three as in straight classes;</p>
<p>If the District stops receiving State funding for class size reductions in grades<br/>kindergarten through grade three, or the funding is reduced by the State, or the State<br/>alters the formula for calculating funding incentives for class size reductions, or the<br/>class size expectations by the State and/or the Board of Trustees is altered, then the<br/>provisions in Section 2, item 10, of this agreement are nullified and contract language<br/>in Section 2, paragraphs 1 -9, will determine District class size.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX<br/>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>

<p>In the event that future legislation is passed by the State Legislature that creates more restrictive<br/>requirements for student instruction contact time or minimum instructional days, this clause shall<br/>be reopened to conform to such requirements.</p>
<p>On Fridays, days of evening meetings, and days before holidays, unit members may leave at the<br/>end of the student day after all duties are completed. This time is compensatory for hours spent<br/>at District meetings. Back to School Night, Open House, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding student release and staff development days, the District shall provide an additional<br/>two (2) days for use at the school's discretion, and at Central and Ishi Hills Middle Schools for<br/>grades 7-8, at least one (1) such day shall be utilized at the end of the semester for grading and<br/>planning purposes.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>ARTICLE X</p>
<p>LEAVE POLICIES</p>
<p>Section 1 - Paid Leaves</p>
<p>Upon proper notification, members of the unit shall be granted paid leaves as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty Leave</p>
<p>Upon proper notification to the District, members of the unit shall be granted paid<br/>leave for compulsory jury duty with the condition that the County warrant<br/>received for such services be remitted to the District. Any payment for mileage*<br/>meals and lodging will be retained by the employee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>
<p>Every bargaining unit employee shall be entitled to seven (7) hours of paid sick<br/>leave for each register month of employment that the employee is required to<br/>work. A unit member providing service for twelve (12) register months shall<br/>receive eighty-four (84) sick leave hours. A unit member providing service for<br/>more than twelve (12) register months shall be granted one day of compensatory<br/>time off.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused sick leave shall accrue from year to year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each School Year every member of the unit<br/>shall receive a sick leave credit equal to his/her sick leave entitlement<br/>for the School Year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee covered by this Agreement who does not complete a<br/>School Year of service may, at the termination of his/her service,<br/>be charged for hours of sick leave taken which are in excess of the<br/>hours per month of service not covered by previous accumulation.</p>
<p>The daily rate divided by seven hours per day of the substitute will<br/>be charged for each hour of unearned sick leave used by the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members teaching summer school may utilize during the<br/>summer school assignment any sick leave accumulated during the<br/>regular School Year.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide the employee a monthly accounting of<br/>his/her accrued sick leave. In sick leave accounting for OETA unit</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>members who take less than a half-day off in any one day, the<br/>District will attempt to report the use of sick leave as accurately as<br/>possible to the closest hourly increment of actual absence from<br/>work. The actual report for used sick leave for the absent OETA<br/>unit member will not always equal the amount of scheduled<br/>substitute time. Example: Unit member needs a two-hour<br/>substitute teacher. The unit member will receive a half-day<br/>substitute teacher, but be charged with only two hours of absence.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon retirement, any unused sick leave will be applied as a credit<br/>to the employee's retirement, if applicable.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification of illness may be required at any time when deemed<br/>necessary by the District Superintendent.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has utilized all of his/her accumulated sick leave<br/>and is still absent from his/her duties on account of illness or<br/>accident for a period of five (5) school months or less, then the<br/>amount of salary deducted in any month shall not exceed the sum<br/>which was actually paid a substitute. Differential pay shall not<br/>begin until all other paid sick leave provisions for which he/she is<br/>eligible have been exhausted.</p>
<p>When unit members in a nursing, counseling, librarian, or<br/>psychologist position are absent from duty on account of extended<br/>illness or accident and have exhausted all sick leave benefits, the<br/>District will make a good faith effort to secure a fully qualified<br/>substitute to serve in the position. The substitute will be paid at the<br/>first step of the position's salary schedule or if a regular unit<br/>member is used as a substitute he/she will be paid at his/her<br/>placement on the salary schedule. The substitute cost will be<br/>deducted from the absent unit member's daily rate. The unit<br/>member will receive the difference, if any exists.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit member must contact the person in<br/>charge of hiring substitutes as soon as the need to be absent is<br/>known, but in no event less than one (1) hour prior to the start of<br/>the work day to permit the employer time to secure a substitute.</p>
<p>3. Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>A maximum of seven (7) days/forty-nine (49) hours of accumulated sick leave in minimum half¬<br/>day increments may be used in any School Year for personal necessity leave.</p>
<p>For part-time unit members: Unit members working less than full time may use 70% of their<br/>allowable sick leave, rounded to the nearest half-day, in this manner. For example, a 40% time<br/>unit member would earn 4.5 sick days annually (.40 x 11 = 4.4 rounded to 4.5 days) multiplied</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>by .70 = 3.15 rounded to 3 days of eligible personal necessity leave.</p>
<p>Personal necessity leave shall not be cumulative from year to year. Personal necessity leave may<br/>be used for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of a member of the unit member's immediate family when additional leave<br/>is required beyond that provided by the bereavement leave policy.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious illness of the unit member's immediate family or an accident involving<br/>the employee's personal property, or the person or property of the employee's<br/>immediate family.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity days may also be used for circumstances that meet the<br/>following criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are of a significant nature, and</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the unit member cannot be expected to disregard, and</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which necessitates the immediate attention of the unit member, and</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which cannot be accommodated during off-duty hours.</p>
<p>A significant family celebration or occurrence which meets the above criteria is<br/>permissible under this section.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) days of personal necessity leave may be utilized at the unit member's<br/>discretion, excluding personal employment or business, or days preceding or<br/>following a holiday or vacation.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) days of personal necessity leave at differential pay may be utilized at the<br/>unit member’s discretion, excluding personal employment or business, or days<br/>preceding or following a holiday or vacation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Business Leave</p>
<p>A maximum of three (3) unpaid days per year may be used by unit members for<br/>personal business with the advance permission of the Superintendent. Requests<br/>for such leave shall be made at least one week prior to the time that the leave is<br/>desired and granting of said leave shall be contingent upon the acquisition of a<br/>replacement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Business Leave</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will annually provide five (5) days of release time to all resource<br/>specialist program teachers at Central Middle School.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the release time is to allow the special education teachers time to<br/>individually assess students in private and prepare related paperwork in<br/>preparation for the Individual Education Plans. Additional time for student<br/>assessments and preparation for Individual Education Plans may be granted by the<br/>Director of Instruction, as needed.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals, in consultation with special education teachers, will provide private<br/>confidential space for student testing purposes.</p>
<p>7. Inservice Leave</p>
<p>Each unit member is entitled to at least one day of inservice leave per School<br/>Year.

<p>8. Industrial Accident and Illness Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher shall be allowed sixty (60) working days in any one<br/>fiscal year for the same accident.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of the teacher's temporary disability indemnity and the<br/>portion of salary due him/her during his/her absence shall equal<br/>his/her full salary.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher shall be deemed to have recovered from an industrial<br/>accident or illness, and thereby able to return to work, at such time<br/>as his/her physician agrees that there has been such a recovery.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District's report of an industrial accident or illness shall be<br/>kept on file in the District Administration Office.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided in this paragraph are in addition to sick<br/>leave benefits. Accordingly, the District shall not deduct<br/>accumulated sick leave from the sick leave allotment of a teacher<br/>who is absent as the result of an industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>9.</p>
<p>Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>Every teacher shall be entitled to three (3) days of paid leave of absence or five (5)<br/>days if travel of more than two hundred (200) miles is involved, on account of the<br/>death of any member of his/her immediate family. For purposes of this provision<br/>an immediate family member shall be limited to mother, father, sister, brother,<br/>grandmother, grandfather, or a grandchild of the unit member or of the spouse of<br/>the unit member, and the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law,<br/>foster parent or foster child of the unit member or any relative living in the<br/>immediate household of the unit member.

<p>ARTICLE XI</p>
<p>TRANSFERS</p>
<p>A transfer refers to any District action which results in the movement of a unit member from the<br/>position he/she holds immediately preceding such action. Final determination of transfers is<br/>made at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer may be teacher-initiated (&quot;voluntary&quot;) or District-initiated<br/>(&quot;involuntary&quot;).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy exists when a position has no current employee assigned to that position.</p>
<p>All vacancies are subject to transfer requests unless waived by the Association.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for a voluntary transfer must be preceded by a vacancy.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of vacancies shall be posted for at least ten (10) days on a bulletin board in<br/>each building, and a copy sent to the Association president. Such notices shall<br/>be posted as soon as the District determines that a vacancy exists and shall<br/>include the position description and location, grade level, track, rover or non¬<br/>rover (if YRE), subject matter assignment and credential requirement.</p>
<p>Prior to the end of the school year, the Superintendent or designee shall send a</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>form to each unit member upon which the unit member may request notification<br/>of all vacancies which may occur during the summer months.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Postings and Notification of Staff</p>
<p>The District will post all vacancies within the school site before each vacancy is posted<br/>throughout the District. This shall occur in the following manner:</p>
<p>First, the vacancy will be identified by the principal and a posting will occur at the school<br/>site. The principal will notify all certificated site staff through a written note placed in<br/>every teacher’s mailbox. Personal mailings or a personal telephone call will occur for all<br/>staff who are off-track or are home for the summer recess. The intent is that the internal<br/>changes should occur within five (5) working days of the notice, allowing all unit<br/>members at the site the full five (5) days to express interest in the vacancy. Principals<br/>will maintain verification that all unit members were notified regarding each vacancy.</p>
<p>Second, once the intra-school reassignments have been concluded, per the previous<br/>paragraph, the principal will notify the Associate Superintendent of Human Resources<br/>that a vacancy exists for District transfers or a new hire. The Associate Superintendent of<br/>Human Resources will post the vacancy for internal transfers and new hires. The District<br/>will post the vacancy for at least ten (10) days at all schools.</p>
<p>The District will also mail the vacancy notice to all staff who expressed an interest in a<br/>change of assignment and to off-track staff from year-round schools. The District will<br/>notify the OETA President(s) of all vacancies when they occur.</p>
<p>Preference will be given to unit members regardless of traditional or year-round status in<br/>the filling of all vacancies. The transfer requests shall not be approved or denied in an<br/>arbitrary or capricious manner.</p>
<p>Section 2 - Voluntary Transfers</p>
<p>A unit member may request a voluntary transfer to take effect prior to or during the School Year.<br/>The request shall be made in writing and sent to the District Personnel Office.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the request is made for a transfer to take effect during the School Year, it<br/>shall be made within the ten (10) days of the posting period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests for voluntary transfers shall be considered on the basis of three<br/>criteria: (1) credentials to perform the required services; (2) educational needs of<br/>the District as determined by the District; and (3) seniority.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a voluntary transfer request is denied, the unit member, upon request, shall be<br/>provided with the specific reason(s) in writing for the denial. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preference will first be given to present unit members from that site, then from<br/>unit members from other sites, in the filling of new positions or vacancies.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the end of the school year, unit members shall be notified in writing of<br/>their tentative teaching assignments and work locations for the coming School<br/>Year. If the tentative teaching assignments or work locations are changed during<br/>the summer, the unit member shall be notified by certified mail, and the District<br/>shall provide the unit member being transferred or reassigned with assistance in<br/>moving materials to the new assignment.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will request from all unit members in the spring their desires for<br/>placement for the following School Year. When the unit member desires a<br/>change in assignment, a new form may be submitted.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers shall be based on the educational needs of the District as<br/>determined by the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is to be involuntarily transferred shall, in a personal<br/>conference, be notified as early as possible regarding the proposed transfer and<br/>reasons therefore.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conference will be held between the Superintendent and employee considered<br/>for transfer prior to the written notice of transfer or reassignment being delivered<br/>to the employee in person or by certified mail.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is transferred after beginning the current year's assignment,<br/>he/she shall be given three (3) days release time to prepare for the new assignment<br/>and complete the old. A change in &quot;teaching station&quot; shall be defined as an actual<br/>change in classroom location.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be involuntarily transferred from one school site to another<br/>if there is a qualified unit member who has requested a voluntary transfer to that<br/>position.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If through the operation of Section 2, Voluntary Transfers, above, a vacancy still<br/>exists; only the least senior unit member with appropriate credentials may be<br/>involuntarily transferred.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of involuntary transfer due to staff reduction, the unit member remains as<br/>of the previous staff until the first scheduled workday at the new school assignment.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Voluntary Track Transfers</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All voluntary track changes (reassignments) will be handled as any other in-house<br/>reassignment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is faced with a negative financial impact due to a voluntary<br/>transfer the transfer may, by mutual agreement, be delayed, to an agreed upon</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a negative financial impact to the unit member is unavoidable, the District will<br/>provide substitute opportunities at $20.00 above the established long-term<br/>substitute rate to help defray the lost salary.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member may choose any of the preceding possibilities or accept a pay cut<br/>at the appropriate per diem amount for each duty day missed below the number of<br/>contracted workdays.</p>
<p>Section 5 - Involuntary Track Transfers</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will pay unit members their full contract salary if the employee were<br/>to lose workdays due to an involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members involuntarily transferred to a new track will have first choice of any<br/>available track vacancies.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is involuntarily transferred from a previous track assignment<br/>the unit member will have the first choice of any available track vacancies within<br/>the site where the original transfer occurred before voluntary transfer candidates<br/>or new hires are considered.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may choose to return to the track from which he/she was<br/>involuntarily transferred if a vacancy occurs with the next thirty-nine (39) months<br/>at the site where the original transfer occurred.</p>
<p>Section 6 - Initial Track Placement</p>
<p>When unit members are initially assigned track placement, the following procedure will be used:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal track placement of unit members already assigned to the school will be<br/>made first;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school staff (unit members and principal) will arrive at a consensus as defined<br/>by CFIER on how the track placement will be made;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If school-wide consensus is not gained through Step 2, then consensus by grade<br/>level shall be sought on how track placements will be made; and, <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in case of conflict in Steps 2 and 3, the decision of track placements shall<br/>be made based first on District seniority, and second on educational needs of<br/>students.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>&quot;Academic Year&quot; is that portion of the School Year during which the Oroville Elementary<br/>Schools are in regular session according to the adopted District calendars.</p>
<p>&quot;Board&quot; is the Board of Trustees of the Oroville City Elementary School District.</p>
<p>“Classroom Performance” is meeting the performance indicators for instructional<br/>planning and assessment, instructional interaction and learning environment, as presented<br/>in Appendix G.</p>
<p>&quot;Day&quot; for purposes of this article, refers to a day when the employee is on a regularly<br/>assigned workday.</p>
<p>&quot;Dismissal&quot; is the separation from employment of a permanent status teacher for any<br/>reason other than a layoff pursuant to the California Education Code.</p>
<p>&quot;District Standards&quot; are the expectations which the Oroville City Elementary School<br/>District holds for all certificated staff members (See Appendix G).</p>
<p>&quot;Evaluation&quot; is a systematic procedure for collecting information based on predetermined<br/>objectives or indicators, and analyzing that information for the purpose of helping make<br/>decisions regarding the teacher's performance, job assignment, employment, professional<br/>growth, and the recommended strategies to deal with identified deficiencies of teaching<br/>performance. It is based upon at least two (2) formal observations and other data<br/>collected pursuant to this Article, which shall include a conference and written report.</p>
<p>&quot;Evaluator&quot; is the administrator or designee assigned by the District to monitor, observe,<br/>and evaluate the certificated staff member as defined in Education Code section 35160.5<br/>and who has received education and training in evaluation skills certified by the Board of<br/>Trustees which will enable him/her to make fair, professional, and credible evaluations of<br/>the personnel he/she is responsible for evaluating. The District shall notify the unit<br/>member of the identity of his/her evaluator, if it is different from his/her immediate<br/>supervisor, by October 1 of each School Year.</p>
<p>&quot;Formal Observation&quot; consists of three (3) parts:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-planning Activities - a pre-planning conference, including the<br/>completion of the pre-planning sheet, will be conducted for a minimum of<br/>one observation.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Observation - is comprised of not less than a thirty (30) minute<br/>observation, occurring at not less than a two (2) week interval, by the unit<br/>member's evaluator which generates a written record and conference.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Conference - is held within five (5) days following a<br/>formal observation for the purpose of discussing the observation and other</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>factors relevant to the performance indicators as adopted by the Oroville<br/>City Elementary School District.</p>
<p>&quot;Informal Observation&quot; is unstructured, day-to-day observation, and can be of any length.<br/>Its purpose is to validate and support effective instruction and to monitor overall<br/>performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Job Descriptions&quot; are abstracts of the performance indicators containing the<br/>requirements of the job.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-reelection&quot; is the separation from employment of a probationary teacher by the<br/>Board at the expiration of a specific contractual period.</p>
<p>&quot;Performance Indicators&quot; serve to describe observable behaviors which, when performed,<br/>indicate fulfillment of the District standards.</p>
<p>&quot;Professional Development Plan&quot; is a comprehensive, mutually agreed to plan to (1)<br/>identify areas of needed improvement, (2) specify behaviors which must be demonstrated,</p>
<p>(3) develop a set of interventions, and (4) develop a formal evaluation process to assess<br/>growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Ratings&quot; will be designated as follows:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exceeds Standard&quot; means a rating in any performance standard in which<br/>the staff member exceeds those performance indicators.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meets Standard&quot; the unit member is consistent and effective in fulfilling<br/>those performance indicators.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Growth Needed&quot; means that the evaluatee is inconsistent in fulfilling<br/>those performance indicators.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Unsatisfactory Performance&quot; the unit member is ineffective in fulfilling<br/>the performance indicators.</p>
<p>&quot;Teacher&quot; includes all regularly assigned full or regular part-time general instructional<br/>and/or subject area classroom teachers, counselors, special education teachers, librarians,<br/>psychologists, speech and language pathologists, and nurses.</p>
<p>&quot;School Year&quot; is the first (1st) day of July through the thirtieth (30th) day of June.</p>
<p>2. General Considerations</p>
<p>A. The primary purpose of performance evaluation is the improvement of instruction<br/>through evaluating the job performance and teaching techniques of the teacher<br/>being evaluated. The responsibility for the evaluation of teachers rests with their<br/>principals or immediate supervisors.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>Evaluation of teachers will be based primarily on classroom performance,<br/>demonstrated instructional skills, and other professional aspects of teacher<br/>performance, providing that such factors include the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observed by the observer as part of a formal observation; or</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought to the attention of the evaluatee in writing as a result of formal or<br/>informal observation by the evaluator or by other District administrators; or</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substantiated in writing if originating from any other source, subject to the<br/>complaint procedure.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom performance” shall be defined as meeting the<br/>performance indicators for instructional planning and<br/>assessment, instructional interaction and learning environment,<br/>as presented in Appendix G.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student scores from common benchmark assessments and<br/>standardized tests will be used only as secondary indicators of<br/>actual classroom performance and will not be used on teacher<br/>performance evaluation forms. Scores should be evaluated on<br/>the basis of improvement and not against a standard or<br/>benchmark arbitrarily determined by the State or Federal<br/>Governments, the District or other agencies.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Evaluation</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent status teachers shall be evaluated at least once every two (2) years.<br/>More frequent evaluations may be initiated by either the principal or teacher. If<br/>an evaluation is requested by a permanent status teacher more often than once a<br/>school year, or on a non-conforming schedule, the principal shall comply with<br/>said request in conformity with the provisions of this Article. If a permanent<br/>status teacher is to be evaluated more than once every two (2) years on the<br/>principal's initiative, the principal shall provide reasons in writing why such<br/>additional evaluation is deemed necessary, and a conference shall be held to<br/>discuss these reasons. All permanent status unit members will be evaluated no<br/>later than March 15 in their evaluation year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary or temporary teachers shall be evaluated by January 1 during each<br/>year of such service.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All permanent status unit members will be evaluated according to the following<br/>cycle: A-E and S-Z in School Years beginning with odd numbers (i.e. 1999-<br/>2000), F-R in School Years beginning with even numbers (i.e. 2000-01),</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>according to the first letter in the unit member's first legal name, as it appears on<br/>the credential, and the same pattern will continue to be utilized in the future.</p>
<p>4. Observations</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two observations, held at least two (2) weeks apart and lasting 30 minutes<br/>or longer, shall be held prior to each required evaluation. The observer shall make<br/>written evaluation comments on the proper form and give a copy to the</p>
<p>teacher within five (5) working days.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than five (5) working days after each observation a conference shall be<br/>held between the observer and teacher. The focal point of the conference shall be<br/>the teacher's objectives for the lesson and the teacher's observed instructional<br/>strengths and weaknesses as displayed in the lesson.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance notification shall be given at least one (1) working day before the initial<br/>formal observation. At the time of the notification, the observer may request that<br/>the teacher give him/her the objectives for the lesson or lessons to be observed, in<br/>which event the teacher shall furnish such objectives to the observer not later than<br/>the end of the working day immediately preceding the day of the formal<br/>observation. If the objectives are requested of the unit member, a three (3) day<br/>advanced notification must be given. In the event the observer is unable to attend<br/>a previously scheduled formal observation, the observer and teacher shall confer<br/>for the purpose of jointly rescheduling another such formal observation.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the observer and the teacher will sign and retain a copy of the observation<br/>record (see Appendix E). If the teacher wishes, he/she may make additional<br/>written comments within fifteen (15) working days, and they will be attached to<br/>the report.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observation shall be documented on form E (see Appendix E).</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be entitled to have a representative of the Association<br/>present at any observation conference.</p>
<p>5. Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance evaluation shall be documented on form F (see Appendix F).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the observations and the post-observation conferences have been<br/>completed, the evaluator shall conduct an evaluation of the unit member and an<br/>evaluation conference will be held by March 15th. At this time, a copy of the<br/>performance evaluation (see Appendix F) shall be given to the unit member.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each initial evaluation in a School Year shall be based upon at least two (2)<br/>observations conducted not less than two (2) weeks apart and lasting not less<br/>than thirty (30) minutes, by the evaluator. At least three (3) observations shall<br/>take place prior to any negative comments or judgments being included in the<br/>evaluation.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas where improvement is needed.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional resources to be utilized to assist with improvement, including<br/>release time if requested, for unit members to observe other classes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator's role in assisting the unit member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Techniques for measurement of improvement.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time schedule for monitoring of improvement.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content or substance of the evaluation shall not be subject to the grievance<br/>procedures. Any grievance shall be limited to a claim that the evaluation<br/>procedures have been violated.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be entitled to have a representative of the Association<br/>present at any evaluation conference.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the teacher and the evaluator shall sign and retain a copy of the performance<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory Performance</p>
<p>A. Permanent Status Unit Members</p>
<p>Any permanent status unit member who receives an initial unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation shall, upon written request received by the evaluator within ten (10)<br/>working days of the receipt of the evaluation, receive a subsequent evaluation not<br/>later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the last school day scheduled for the<br/>current School Year. During the evaluation period following the initial negative<br/>evaluation, the unit member shall be observed at least twice at not less than two<br/>(2) week intervals.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the follow-up evaluation shall be to note the progress, if<br/>any, of the unit member pursuant to the suggestions for improvement set<br/>forth by the evaluator, as per Item 6 (C) of this Article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the unit member or the evaluator may request that the follow-up<br/>evaluation be performed by another administrator designated by the<br/>District Superintendent.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>If the unit member does not request a subsequent evaluation, or the<br/>follow-up evaluation requested by the unit member continues to remain<br/>&quot;unsatisfactory&quot; the unit member shall be evaluated the following year. If<br/>the unit member participates in a professional development plan pursuant<br/>to Section C below, he/she shall be evaluated at the conclusion of the<br/>program. If the unit member does not participate in a professional<br/>development plan (see Appendix H) pursuant to Section C below, and if<br/>the initial evaluation in the second year remains &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; that unit<br/>member shall then receive a subsequent evaluation that School Year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and Temporary Status Unit Members</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the unit member or the evaluator may request that the follow-up<br/>evaluation due by March 1 be performed by another administrator<br/>designated by the District Superintendent.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any probationary unit member who is dismissed by the District shall<br/>receive written notification no later than March 15 of the second<br/>probationary year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Development Plan</p>
<p>If a unit member has received any &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; evaluation ratings,</p>
<p>he/she will be requested to participate in a formal professional development plan</p>
<p>(see Appendix H). The following conditions shall govern the development plan:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation shall be voluntary.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the plan shall be mutually agreed to by the unit member and<br/>the evaluator.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time shall be provided when required by the nature of the plan.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan shall relate to the cause creating the unsatisfactory evaluation<br/>rating.</p>

<p>The District shall seal all negative observations and evaluations forty-eight (48) months<br/>subsequent to the date on the written material. The envelope seal shall be signed and<br/>dated by the unit member and District Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedural Guidelines</p>
<p>A. A unit member shall not be required to participate in the evaluation and/or<br/>observation of other unit members or employees.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not be held accountable for District activities typically<br/>performed by classified employees over whom the unit member has no authority<br/>or ability to correct if deficient.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All observation of the work of the unit member shall be conducted openly and<br/>with the full knowledge of the unit member. The evaluator shall not base his/her<br/>evaluation of a unit member on any information which was gathered by other than<br/>direct observation, unless it can be substantiated by a thorough investigation. The<br/>unit member shall be informed in writing of any additional items raised by the<br/>investigation which may affect the evaluation.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in rank or<br/>compensation, suspended, or deprived of any professional advantages without<br/>reasonable and just cause.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content or substance of the evaluation shall not be subject to the grievance<br/>procedures. Any grievance shall be limited to a claim that the evaluation<br/>procedures have been violated.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>PUBLIC CHARGES</p>

<p>Section 1 - Qualifying Events</p>
<p>Unit members may qualify for a catastrophic leave after all paid sick leave is exhausted and he/she<br/>has suffered an illness or injury which is:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expected to incapacitate him/her for an extended period of time; or,</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That incapacitates a member of the unit member’s immediate family, as defined in<br/>paragraph 9 (Bereavement Leave) of Article X, “Leave Policies,” which requires<br/>him/her to take time off to care for the family member; and in either instance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creates a financial hardship for the unit member because he/she has exhausted all<br/>sick leave and other paid time off.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Section 2 - Salary Protection</p>
<p>The Oroville Elementary Teachers’ Association will annually inform unit members that salary<br/>protection programs are available to them through their professional organization and other insurance<br/>programs.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Limitation of Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>An initial catastrophic leave request is not to exceed thirty (30) workdays. However, if a unit<br/>member is unable to return to work following the use of the initial catastrophic leave, then he/she<br/>may reapply for additional catastrophic leave. In no case, shall the total catastrophic leave granted to<br/>a unit member exceed sixty (60) days within a School Year.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Application Process</p>
<p>A unit member who believes he/she qualifies for catastrophic leave shall submit, in writing, a request<br/>for catastrophic leave. The request shall be submitted to the Oroville Elementary Teachers’<br/>Association Representative Council on a form provided by OETA. The request shall state the facts<br/>which support the need for a catastrophic leave. The OETA Representative Council is solely<br/>responsible for reviewing all requests for catastrophic leave and informing the unit member of their<br/>decision.</p>
<p>When a catastrophic leave request has been approved by the Representative Council, the OETA<br/>president will inform unit members at each site that a unit member has been incapacitated or is<br/>dealing with a catastrophic illness or injury of an immediate family member. The OETA president<br/>will inform all unit members that a “leave donation drive” has been initiated to solicit donated sick<br/>leave days for the needy unit member.</p>
<p>Each donation drive will be a total of ten (10) working days in length. OETA agrees to provide the<br/>District with a “Notice of Intent” to hold a donation drive.</p>
<p>Unit members may donate up to two (2) days of accrued sick leave to the unit member who has been<br/>approved for the catastrophic leave. All donations shall be submitted, in writing, on a form supplied<br/>by the Oroville Elementary Teachers’ Association.</p>
<p>Donations shall be numbered in priority order by the Oroville Elementary Teachers’ Association as<br/>they are received by OETA. The drive shall be declared as “finished” when either: 1) the amount of<br/>sick days requested by the unit member has been donated; 2) thirty (30) sick days have been donated<br/>by unit members; or 3) the drive has lasted for ten (10) workdays.</p>
<p>Section 5 - Processing of Catastrophic Leave Donations</p>
<p>The Oroville Elementary Teachers’ Association Representative Council shall have the responsibility<br/>of maintaining records of the receipt and review of all catastrophic leave requests, donations of sick<br/>leave and the status of each catastrophic leave drive. It will be the responsibility of the OETA<br/>chapter president to communicate in writing, through use of approved forms in Appendix K, the<br/>Representative Council’s decisions concerning catastrophic leave requests, the success of donation<br/>drives and the status of each catastrophic leave incident to the donors of sick leave, recipients of</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>catastrophic leave, the human resources department and District business office. Any use of<br/>catastrophic leave by a recipient shall be reported by OETA directly to the business office on or<br/>before the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month to avoid loss of pay by the recipient.</p>
<p>If all donated sick days are not utilized by the approved unit member for the purpose of catastrophic<br/>leave, then the unused sick days will revert back to unit members who donated them, in a numerated<br/>order, with the first donated days being utilized as catastrophic leave and the later donated days being<br/>returned to the donors.</p>
<p>Section 6 - Agreement Concerning Grievances and Litigation</p>
<p>The Oroville Elementary Teachers’ Association agrees that it will not file on its behalf, or on behalf<br/>of a unit member, a grievance, claim or lawsuit related to an attempt by a unit member to challenge<br/>the OETA Representative Council’s decisions concerning catastrophic leave and/or the content of<br/>this article, Article XXVII, “Catastrophic Leave.”</p>
<p>OETA agrees to reimburse the Oroville City Elementary School District, as well as its officers and<br/>agents, for all legal fees and related legal costs incurred, after written notice to OETA concerning a<br/>challenge, in defending against any court of administrative action challenging OETA’s decisions, and<br/>the decisions of OETA officers, in implementing this article, Article XXVII, “Catastrophic Leave.”</p>
<p>OETA shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether such action shall be<br/>compromised, resisted, defended and/or appealed.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXVIII<br/>LIVING CONTRACT</p>
<p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from July 1, 2012, up to and including June<br/>30,2015, and thereafter shall continue in effect year by year unless one of the parties notifies the<br/>other in writing no later than March 15 of its request to modify, amend or terminate the<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>The Oroville Elementary Teachers’ Association and the Oroville City Elementary School District<br/>agree that contract Articles will be considered &quot;living&quot; and issues will be discussed as they arise.</p>
<p>Not later than July 1 of the calendar year in which this Agreement expires, the parties shall meet<br/>and negotiate in good faith on negotiable items. Any agreement reached between the parties<br/>shall be reduced in writing and signed by both parties.</p>
