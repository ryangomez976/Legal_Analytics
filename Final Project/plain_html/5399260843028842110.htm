<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic Work Day. Times of arrival and departure shall be set in each school by the principal with the<br/>advice of the faculty, provided that the full work day, including the thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch<br/>period, shall be seven and one half (7 1/2) consecutive hours, (traditional calendar) or seven and<br/>three-quarters (7 3/4) consecutive hours (YRE calendar). Individual exceptions may be approved by<br/>the immediate supervisor for a given day. The faculty of a school includes all certificated employees<br/>assigned to that site.</p>
<p>The Union philosophically disagrees with the necessity of specifying the number of hours per day that<br/>a teacher must work because it does not acknowledge the professionalism of the teachers of the<br/>PVUSD.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-Time Work Day. The immediate supervisor, in consultation with the teachers who work less<br/>than full time, shall set appropriate arrival and departure times.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Time.</p>
<p>1. Double session kindergarten teachers, before or after teaching their own classes, shall be assigned,<br/>in consultation with the affected faculty, an additional sixty (60) minutes of assistance. Single¬<br/>session kindergarten teachers, before or after teaching their own classes, shall be assigned, in<br/>consultation with the affected faculty, an additional sixty (60) minutes of assistance or instruction.<br/>The remainder of the work day for that school shall include reasonable preparation time and other<br/>duties related to the kindergarten and supervisory program as assigned by the immediate<br/>supervisor.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom teachers in grades K-3 shall, during that portion of the work day that primary classes<br/>are notin session, be provided with an average of ninety (90) minutes per five (5) workdays for<br/>preparation time. In addition, each primary (grades 1-3) teacher shall be granted sixty (60)<br/>minutes per week of release time. Teachers may be assigned other duties related to the<br/>instructional and supervisory programs on a reasonable basis by their immediate supervisor<br/>during the preparation time provided outside the instructional day*</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year, teachers in grades 4, 5 and 6 or any<br/>combination of 4/5 or 5/6 (at elementary school sites) will be provided with an average of thirty<br/>(30) minutes per day of preparation time or one hundred and fifty (150) minutes of preparation<br/>time per five working days. Preparation time will occur during the instructional day.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those elementary teachers who teach combination classes shall be excluded from supervisory duties<br/>within the workday provided that the majority of the faculty votes in favor of the exclusion. The<br/>principal shall initiate a secret ballot voting process during the first week of school. The votes will be<br/>counted in the presence of a PVFT representative. The district and PVFT shall conduct a survey of the<br/>practice of comparable districts regarding combination class teachers. The results of that survey shall be<br/>examined in the spring of 2010.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Classroom teachers in senior/middle/junior high school shall be provided with one daily</p>
<p>preparation period equal in length to one instructional period. Part time employees who are<br/>employed for three (3) periods or less, receive no preparation period. Part time employees who<br/>teach four (4) periods or more, receive a preparation period.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a proposed senior/middle/junior high school schedule change that deviates from this<br/>standard, a 2/3 majority of the voting classroom teachers at the site may recommend modification of<br/>the schedule and modification of the preparation period provisions of this section of the Agreement.<br/>The vote will be by secret ballot. The recommendation will then be sent to the District and PVFT<br/>for negotiations. Part time teachers will vote proportionally, consistent with their teaching day.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions may occur on days with special scheduling. On these days, the principal, with the<br/>advice of the teachers, shall arrange a schedule that considers any loss of preparation time on a<br/>reasonable and equitable basis.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional Teaching Schedule: Upon request from a site administrator, secondary teachers on a<br/>traditional schedule may agree, on an as-needed basis, to teach six (6) periods the first<br/>semester and four (4) periods the second semester with two (2) preparation periods the<br/>second semester. Preparation periods shall be consecutive unless the site administrator and<br/>the employee mutually agree otherwise. When more than one (1) teacher from a department<br/>volunteers, seniority shall prevail.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>6. During their preparation periods, teachers may be required to substitute for another teacher or<br/>perform occasional supervisory duties when student safety is of primary concern. Such<br/>substituting shall be assigned on a reasonable and equitable basis consistent with the general<br/>guidelines below,</p>
<p>a. Creation of lists.</p>

<p>b. Assignment Process.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrator shall first assign an available substitute teacher who is on site to<br/>teach the class.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no substitute is available, the site administrator shall call for volunteers.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no volunteers, the site administrator shall contact certificated employees in<br/>the rotational order, based on the list referred to in the paragraph above (5, a, ii).</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A daily record of certificated staff who substituted will be maintained and made<br/>available for review.</p>
<p>c. Compensation.</p>
<p>i. Teachers who substitute during their preparation period shall be paid in accordance<br/>with Article VII, Section E.</p>

The District and the Union<br/>shall, after agreement on the calendar, meet and develop a list of restructured days.</p>
<p>Restructured days at the elementary schools are created to allow time for individual teacher<br/>preparation. Nothing contained herein shall preclude teachers from choosing to participate in grade<br/>level collaboration on restructured days. In months with three (3) or more restructured days, one of<br/>these days for grades 1-6 (at elementary school sites) may be utilized for such purposes as staff<br/>development and/or curriculum coordination. Any additional directed staff development days for<br/>any month must be approved by a sixty percent (60%) majority vote of the teachers at the site.</p>
<p>No school shall miss more than one restructured/modified day due to the parent/teacher conference<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>During parent/teacher conference weeks and the last week of each semester, no elementary schools<br/>will have restructured days.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Attendance at general faculty meetings may not be required during the first two [2] hours of<br/>restructured time.</p>
<p>During weeks without restructured days, a thirty (30) consecutive minute per day duty-free period<br/>shall be provided before or after school and during the seven and one half (7-1/2) hour work day for<br/>traditional teachers, or seven and three quarters (7-3/4) hour work day for YRE teachers.</p>
<p>When release time is reinstated in the future, restructured days shall be discontinued. Restructured<br/>days shall not set a precedent as a permanent replacement for release time.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Service Duties</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal, in consultation with the teachers, shall determine the number and types of<br/>supervisory duties or equitable methods of assignment of these duties, the number and types of<br/>duties to be performed outside of the Basic Work Day, which might include one &quot;back to school<br/>night,&quot; one open house, school and district committee meetings, in-service sessions, supervision of<br/>student activities and other school activities or events.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, teacher volunteers shall be used to perform duties outside of the Basic Work<br/>Day, provided that, should the principal, with the advice of the faculty, determine that assignments<br/>are necessary.

<p>Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate the employee<br/>or a member of his/her immediate family for an extended period of time, requires the employee to<br/>take time off from work for an extended period of time, and taking extended time off work creates a<br/>financial hardship for the employee.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XIII. EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. Teachers shall be evaluated by a procedure that is continuous, comprehensive and uniform</p>
<p>throughout the District. Teachers will be evaluated based on the Pajaro Valley Professional Standards<br/>and the California Standards for the Teaching Profession. See Exhibits C-l through C-5 in this<br/>Agreement. The primary objective of evaluation is to maintain or improve the quality of instruction in<br/>the district. This evaluation process shall be in compliance with the provisions of the Education Code.</p>
<p>Separate from the formal evaluation process, both the Union and the District encourage teachers to<br/>take advantage of the Voluntary Peer Assistance and Review (PAR] process as a professional<br/>development opportunity. See Exhibit G.</p>
<p>The primary evaluator shall be the certificated immediate supervisor. By mutual agreement of the<br/>evaluator and the evaluatee, parents and students may be involved in the evaluation process, and the<br/>process and forms for such participation shall be mutually agreed to by the evaluator and the<br/>evaluatee prior to such participation.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher evaluation program will consist of three (3) options. See Chart on exhibit C-4 of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each probationary, temporary or categorical (non-permanent) employee shall be given at least<br/>one (1) written performance evaluation each year.</p>
<p>Categorical (non-permanent) employees will be evaluated on the administrative mandated option<br/>for their first two (2) years. Beginning with their third (3rd) year in the District, after receiving<br/>two (2) successful evaluations on the administrative option, categorical (non permanent)<br/>employees will be governed by the same evaluation options and procedures as permanent<br/>teachers in good standing.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who transfer shall take their Evaluation Option with them.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall make formal observations of not less than thirty (30) minutes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process shall be completed in sufficient time so that each teacher shall receive<br/>his/her evaluation no later than the 152nd day.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of deadlines/timelines will be distributed by the Human Resources Dept.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-As si stance and Mandatory Peer-Assistance &amp; Review (PAR)</p>
<p>The Primary purpose of Pre-Assistance is to improve the quality of classroom instruction and<br/>promote higher student achievement. However, at times some staff require additional guidance and<br/>support to maintain Professional Standards. If additional guidance and support is needed, the<br/>supervising administrator will initiate the Pre-Assistance process. When a certificated staff member<br/>is placed on Pre-Assistance, there is no record of it submitted to his/her certificated personnel file.</p>
<p>1. Pre-Assistance:</p>
<p>Pre-Assistance is focused on specific areas of the Professional Standards and is to be viewed<br/>positively as providing the necessary guidance and support required to reestablish Professional<br/>Standards. The duration for Pre-Assistance is a minimum of 10 weeks for tenured staff.</p>
<p>The supervising administrator will give a written notice to the unit member regarding:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the problem in relationship to the Professional Standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the desired behavior in relationship to the Professional Standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date(s) when the problem has occurred</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date when the problem is to be resolved; and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations and assistance that will be given to the teacher</p>
<p>At the completion of the pre-assistance plan, one of the following actions will occur:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuance/extension of the pre-assistance plan</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referral to mandatory PAR (Peer Assistance and Review) if tenured</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>• Problem is resolved and Professional Standards met, return to current evaluation<br/>option</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory PAR Referral process.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the summative meeting of the pre-assistance process, the Administrator notifies the<br/>unit member of the referral to PAR and provides the unit member the packet titled, “Peer<br/>Assistance and Review Guidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refer to Exhibit C5 for the mandatory PAR referral process.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The packet titled &quot;Peer Assistance and Review Guidelines&quot; is also available for review at<br/>both the Union office and the Human Resources Dept.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall not be permitted to advance to a higher step or column on the teacher salary<br/>schedule while on mandatory PAR. Mandatory PAR is generally assigned for the entire school<br/>year. If, however, a teacher has corrected noted problems in the first semester, she/he could be<br/>taken off mandatory PAR for the second semester. In addition, a teacher assigned to<br/>mandatory PAR is not eligible to advance on the salary schedule until the beginning of the new<br/>school year that follows the successful completion of the PAR Plan.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIV. REASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bargaining unit members are employees of the District and not of one particular school, division or<br/>department. Teachers assigned to Migrant Education, Special Education, GATE and other specially<br/>designed programs shall be considered members of the department, and shall be subject to<br/>reassignment based upon department needs and teacher qualifications.</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall be assigned solely within the scope of their authorizations and in<br/>compliance with the mandates of the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and other legal<br/>mandates. Bargaining unit members shall not be reassigned or transferred outside the scope of their<br/>certificates without their written consent and appropriate action by the Governing Board. Areas of<br/>demonstrated competence, as well as program needs, must be a strong consideration in reassignment<br/>and transfer. Unintentional failure to inform an employee of these requirements does not waive the<br/>employee's responsibility to meet the requirements necessary to maintain a valid credential<br/>necessary to continue employment in the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following definitions shall apply to reassignment and transfer.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment is the placement within a given school of a bargaining unit member to a different<br/>position with a different grade level (such as second to third grade), or a different department<br/>(such as science to social studies), or both (such as seventh grade social studies to eighth grade<br/>mathematics).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer is a relocation from school to school and may include a change in grade level and subject:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer may be teacher-initiated (voluntary); or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer may be district-initiated (involuntary).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancy is an unfilled certificated position. A vacancy may be created by death, resignation,<br/>retirement, termination, transfer, reassignment, expansion of program, or increased enrollment.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>Vacancies created by a teacher on leave of absence for one semester or longer shall be posted and<br/>may be filled by a regular employee on a one-semester or one-year replacement basis, by a<br/>substitute, or by a temporary employee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority: District seniority shall be determined by the amount of time a certificated employee has<br/>been continuously employed in the District beginning with the first day of service in a<br/>probationary position with the District or one of its pre-unification parts, including any time of<br/>district-approved leave. When District seniority is the same, then site seniority shall be the second<br/>consideration. Site seniority shall be the amount of continuous service in a particular school in a<br/>probationary or permanent position. In the event that more than one certificated employee has<br/>the lowest seniority, the first date of paid service as a regular certificated (non-substitute)<br/>employee will be considered, with the least seniority subject to transfer. Certificated employees in<br/>special categories, including, but not limited to Special Education, Speech, and Psychologist, shall<br/>gain seniority in their special category, in lieu of site seniority. A certificated employee who<br/>accepts a special District assignment for a period not exceeding three (3) years and who returns to<br/>his/her former school, shall retain his/her original site seniority. When two (2) certificated<br/>employees have the same district and site seniority, a lottery shall be used to break the tie. The<br/>affected certificated employees, plus representatives of the Union, shall have the right to be<br/>present for the lottery drawing.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year of service is service performed, under contract, for seventy-five percent (75%) of the days<br/>of the basic school year as listed in the school calendar.</p>
<p>C. General Provisions.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. All vacancies, including extra pay assignments, shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each</p>
<p>school and in the District Office, as far in advance of the closing date for submission of<br/>applications as practical, ordinarily at least ten (10) working days, and in no case less than five</p>
<p>(5) working days. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the Union at the time of the posting.<br/>Vacancies shall also be announced by recorded telephone message.</p>
<p>b. Prior consideration shall be given to in-district unit members applying for extra pay<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice shall describe the position, state whether or not the position is temporary, state the<br/>qualifications required, and shall state the final date for receipt of applications. The Human<br/>Resources Dept, shall see that qualifications which may be desired in employees new to the<br/>District are stated in such a way that they do not discourage transfer applications from within the<br/>District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 10th, the Human Resource Office shall compile and post in each school, a list of all<br/>anticipated open positions for the upcoming school year. A copy shall be sent to the Union.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may elect not to make an actual transfer until the beginning of the next school quarter<br/>or semester, but the assignment shall be made, and any vacancies created by the transfer shall be<br/>processed.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing employees shall receive written notification of their grade level and/or subjects<br/>assignment and school assignment on or about May 20th for the next school year, except where</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on leave of absence of one year or less shall return to his/her former school, except<br/>s/he may request to be reassigned or transferred or may be considered for reassignment or<br/>transfer the same as employees who are not on leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers who accept special district assignments shall be given, in writing, the terms and<br/>conditions of those assignments, such as a brief summary of the duties and the length of the<br/>assignment. A teacher so assigned shall be placed on leave from his/her classroom duties, not to<br/>exceed two (2) years, and a short-term replacement, temporary or substitute employee may be<br/>hired to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority for Placement:</p>
<p>In verified vacancies, the following priority shall prevail:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returnees from sabbatical leave;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons displaced because of declining enrollment or reduction or discontinuance of<br/>programs;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unassigned teachers returning from leave;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary employees with rehiring rights at the same school;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher-initiated transfer requests;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other temporaries.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary teacher placement: If a teacher has been interviewed for a position and was assigned<br/>as a temporary teacher for the school year, that teacher may be re-employed in that school<br/>without an interview, if the performance has been satisfactory.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a transfer occurs while school is in session, at least two (2) working days without classroom<br/>duties shall be provided for moving and preparation. Additional days may be granted upon joint<br/>request of the receiving principal and the employee transferring.</p>

<p>of a request to be reassigned or transferred by the District, may appeal in writing to the<br/>Superintendent. The Superintendent or designee shall decide the merits of the original<br/>decision by the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>b. The decision of the Superintendent shall be provided to the Board if requested by the</p>
<p>employee. The Board shall review the Superintendent’s decision and inform the Union and the</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>teacher of its decision. The actual transfer shall not occur until the written decision of the<br/>Superintendent or his/her District level designee has been received.</p>
<p>c. This appeal procedure is intended for review of decisions made. Alleged violations of<br/>procedures provided for in this Article shall be resolved by the provisions of Article XVI.</p>
<p>D. Reassignment.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A regular teacher may request reassignment to a vacancy occurring in his/her school and the<br/>request shall be acted upon before the vacancy is posted or advertised for transfer and/or hiring<br/>from outside the District.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall make every reasonable effort to meet with the affected teachers to<br/>discuss the reassignment.</p>
<p>E. Teacher-Initiated Transfer.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may apply for any posted vacancy if: (a) they have two [2] years of service in the<br/>District; (b) they have not placed on PAR within the last two [2] years; and, [c] they have not<br/>accepted a teacher-initiated transfer in the last two [2] years.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Dept, shall forward to the principal, or other administrator having<br/>authority to fill the vacancy, the names of all teachers who have applied for a posted vacancy, and<br/>the names of those teachers whose general requests for transfer are on file.</p>

<p>F. District-Initiated Transfers</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. When two or more teachers are being considered for a district initiated transfer to the same</p>
<p>position, and when the immediate supervisor determines, after considering qualifications and<br/>district needs, that two or more teachers are equally qualified, seniority shall be used to make<br/>a final determination.</p>
<p>b. When teacher(s) are to be transferred for reasons including, but not limited to, enrollment<br/>changes or mandated programs, and when the appropriate administrator(s) determine(s),<br/>after considering school and district needs, that these needs have been met, seniority shall be<br/>used to make a final determination.

The appeal shall be in writing and shall be submitted within ten (10) days<br/>after the unit member receives the supervisor's Step 2 answer. This appeal shall include a copy of the<br/>original grievance, the supervisor's answer, and a statement of the reasons for the appeal.

<p>Step 5: Should mediation at Step 4 fail to resolve the dispute, or if the parties mutually agree to skip</p>
<p>mediation, the Federation may submit the matter to arbitration by notifying the District within twenty<br/>(20) days following mediation or after the Step 3 decision, if mediation is skipped. The parties shall<br/>first attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. Should that not be possible, the parties shall request a list of<br/>seven (7) arbitrators from the State Conciliation Service. The Federation and the District shall<br/>alternately strike one name until the name of a single arbitrator remains. Lots shall be drawn to decide<br/>which party strikes first.</p>
<p>The hearing shall be conducted in a timely manner. All expenses of the arbitrator and court reporter,<br/>if required by the arbitrator, shall be divided equally between the Federation and the District. The<br/>parties shall pay their own costs for representation. The findings and recommendations of the<br/>arbitrator shall be final and binding.</p>
<p>In the event that the parties negotiate a salary formula in the future, the formula and its interpretation<br/>shall not be subject to binding arbitration under this paragraph unless otherwise negotiated by the<br/>parties. As used herein, “salary formula” means a computation for increasing or decreasing the salary<br/>schedule(s) or the salary of the unit as a whole, based on factors defined in the formula.</p>

<p>-Evaluated by the administrator every two years including at least one documented<br/>administrative observation which will be shared with the instructor.</p>
<p>-Any unsatisfactory evaluation invokes the district plan of pre-assistance, which will be<br/>completed before instructor is released.</p>

<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary instructors: Administrative Mandate Model</p>
<p>-Three conference cycles<br/>-Observation tools based on the ICAI<br/>-Three pre-conferences with administrator<br/>-Three administrative observations<br/>-Three post conferences with the administrator<br/>-Mid year report on progress in the ICAI</p>
<p>-Staff and administrative meeting - Administrator writes final assessment. Teacher adds comments.</p>
<p>Probationary instructors will develop a portfolio that documents competency and growth. Portfolio will<br/>focus on the competencies listed in the ICAI. Evidence in the portfolio is gathered and reflected upon in<br/>summary to identify growth in the Professional Standards and to guide professional decision making<br/>regarding next steps for improvement.</p>
<p>Contents of the Portfolio:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written reflection on self-assessment of the ICAI.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written focus, goals and plan for documenting growth in selected ICAI competencies.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written summary and accompanying evidence of professional growth in each of the Professional<br/>Standards on the Mid-Year recommendation. The evidence should be based on the written focus, goals<br/>and plans, but may include additional areas.</p>
<p>Supervising Administrators will:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make 3 formal observations and corresponding pre- and post-conferences to document and reflect on<br/>the growth in the Instructor competencies. Request and review evidence for teacher portfolio.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a mid-year Recommendation summarizing two observations and corresponding pre-and post¬<br/>conferences in regards to progress in growth of the Instructor Competencies. An unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation invokes a plan of pre-assistance.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write a Final Evaluation Summary including additional information from the third observation and<br/>pre- and post-conferences regarding progress in the Instructor Competencies.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>IV. Permanent Teachers: Portfolio, Partner or Administrative choice options.</p>
<p>Permanent teachers must be evaluated at least every two years. Permanent teachers may<br/>choose among the Partner, Portfolio, or Administrative Choice Processes. Format of<br/>documentation must match the formats of documents in the PVUSD Certificated<br/>Evaluation Administrative Manual with one noted difference: in place of the Domains of<br/>the Continuum of Teacher Abilities Adult Education instructors will focus inquiry on the<br/>Instructor Competencies Assessment Instrument.</p>
<p>In Pre-As si stance and Peer Assistance and Review processes, referral will be made to the<br/>Instructor Competencies Assessment Instrument but in other ways will use format,<br/>timelines, and process outlined in the PVUSD Certificated Evaluation Administrative<br/>Manual.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction in Staff.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School sites shall establish a Roving Teacher/Team policy.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School sites shall determine if they will have Roving Teachers who change rooms at each track<br/>change.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Site Administrator will determine the Roving Teacher Team assignment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roving Teachers shall be determined annually by May 31st</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are more volunteers than positions, the SRT will determine who receives the roving<br/>assignment</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no one on a Roving Team volunteers to rove, the entire team will rotate and no one will receive a<br/>stipend.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School sites shall establish a list of conditions for classroom use by the Roving Teachers/Team.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roving teachers shall receive a stipend of nine and sixty-four one hundredths percent (9.64%) of<br/>Step 1 on the base salary schedule. If two (2) teachers share the same classroom and volunteer to<br/>be rovers, the stipend shall be shared equally by both. Stipends will be paid from site YRE funds.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All rovers will be provided with a minimum of one (1) lockable, moveable storage cart.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment and materials purchased by school funds (except for materials purchased with<br/>decentralized budget monies) shall be left in the classroom for use by Rovers unless otherwise<br/>mutually agreed upon.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide requested assistance to Rover Teachers on or before Track Change days<br/>for moving carts, cleaning rooms and arranging furniture/supplies.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the site administrator believes that the SRT decision is detrimental to the instructional program,<br/>he/she may implement a different decision or refer it back to the SRT, stating in writing the<br/>adverse impact on the instructional program. The principal’s decision shall not be arbitrary or<br/>capricious.</p>
<p>H. Extra Days.</p>
<p>In order to meet program needs at the site beyond the one hundred and eighty-one (181) days or one<br/>hundred and seventy-five (175) days dependent upon the school’s calendar, the District may offer<br/>employees the opportunity to work additional days to be paid on a per diem basis. (This does not</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>apply to substitute assignments.] Teachers working extra days may use sick leave as prescribed by<br/>Article XII. of this Agreement. Employees who work extra days shall be credited with additional sick<br/>leave at the same rate of accrual as provided in the Agreement. Extra days will be paid on a<br/>supplemental payroll after the workdays have been verified. Additional sick leave, if applicable, will<br/>be credited upon completion of the assignment and verification of the number of days worked. Such<br/>extra days will be first offered to on-site employees and then offered to other YRE employees, and<br/>then referred to the District Human Resources Dept, for posting. Said employees cannot be<br/>involuntarily transferred for refusing to work extra days.</p>
<p>I. Alternate Calendar.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet program needs, unit members and site/program administrators may agree upon<br/>an alternate calendar. When work days have been agreed to, a proposed work calendar will be<br/>submitted to the Human Resources Dept..</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said employee cannot be involuntarily transferred for refusing to work an alternate calendar.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparations.</p>
<p>Every effort will be made to maintain equity at the site level in the number of duties, preparations at<br/>the middle school level and the number of grade levels in elementary combination classes. Any<br/>deviations from the site equity level in terms of the above must be mutually agreed upon by the unit<br/>member and the site administrator. In situations where resolution cannot be reached, the situation<br/>will be referred to the SRT.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher Opt-Outs of YRE.</p>
<p>Teachers at a designated year-round school site will be provided the opportunity to transfer to a<br/>traditional schedule school. This opportunity will become available at the time of initial YRE<br/>designation and after the completion of a first year on YRE. This option will be available for teachers<br/>any time a teacher is involuntarily transferred to a different track and this option will also be<br/>available to District transferred teachers after their first year on YRE. These teachers will be given a<br/>priority in choosing schools. All K-12 District opportunity openings are mailed to the home addresses<br/>of YRE teachers who have notified the District in writing that they want to &quot;opt-out” of YRE. The<br/>original opt-out list will be used as the instrument to determine teachers qualified to opt-out of<br/>current YRE schools. Any teacher from the original list who has been offered three (3] positions will<br/>be permanently eliminated from the list. Opt-out language will be revised if any schools that are<br/>currently on a traditional schedule are required to convert to a YRE schedule. Being eliminated from<br/>the opt out list does not preclude an employee from applying for a transfer under the original transfer<br/>provisions, Article XIV., E. of the Contract.</p>
<p>1. YRE teachers who wish to opt-out of YRE are to notify the Human Resources Dept, in writing. They<br/>shall be given three opportunities to be considered for positions within their demonstrated area of<br/>expertise and/or credentials. The names of the YRE teachers who do not apply for any of the three<br/>opportunities shall be withdrawn from the YRE opt-out list. YRE teachers who apply and are not<br/>selected due to a more senior employee selecting the position shall be given an additional<br/>opportunity.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two (2) or more teachers are being considered for the same position and have indicated in<br/>writing an interest in the same position and both have the appropriate credential and<br/>demonstrated area of expertise, seniority shall prevail.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every reasonable effort shall be made so that a teacher shall not be given a District-initiated<br/>transfer in two (2) successive years.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All K-12 &quot;opportunity&quot; openings in a teacher’s area of demonstrated expertise and/or credentials<br/>are submitted ten (10) calendar days prior to District-wide posting to the probationary and<br/>permanent (tenured) YRE staff who have indicated an interest in opting-out in writing to the<br/>Human Resources Dept.. These will be mailed to their home address.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properly credentialed YRE candidates are to submit a letter of intent for a specific position to the<br/>Human Resources Dept, by 4:00 p.m. of the tenth (10th) calendar day after the postmark on the<br/>envelope.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is closed, if filled by a properly credentialed staff member. After July 1st, teachers will<br/>not transfer to the selected, secured position until their next track change.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers opting out of YRE will keep their site seniority.</p>
<p>L. Substituting.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have the opportunity to substitute when off track.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member must inform the District in writing when s/he is off track and which dates s/he<br/>will be available to substitute.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One copy to be filed with the school.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One copy to be filed with Substitute Services.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One copy to be retained by unit member.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substitute list is to be posted at local site and entered into the subfinder system.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substitute list is to be circulated and posted at other YRE sites.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YRE unit members shall receive priority over regular substitutes at the YRE schools.</p>
<p>(1) On-site over off-site teachers.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If YRE operational money per excess pupil exceeds $830.00, substitute pay shall be $140.00<br/>per day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who substitute may choose to receive pay or may bank the days. (Section L.,<br/>Exchange Days, #8.)</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>M. Exchange Days.</p>
<p>The practices of traditional calendar teachers trading days with YRE teachers will be allowed as in the</p>
<p>Year-Round School side agreement:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who desire to exchange days will make their own arrangements with another<br/>teacher who will be responsible for maintaining the continuity of the academic program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum of five [5] days per school year will be allowed for each teacher.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of extenuating circumstances where a teacher needs more than the days allowed, a unit<br/>member may appeal in writing to his/her principal for additional days. The granting of additional<br/>days must have the approval of the District Office and site administrator.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests must be submitted to the building principal at least five (5) working days prior, within<br/>the same school, or at least ten (10) working days prior, if another school is involved, unless there<br/>is a serious emergency. The approval or denial of exchange days shall be at the sole discretion of<br/>the administration. This decision shall not be arbitrary or capricious, or without basis in fact. If a<br/>request is not approved, the principal will present, in writing, his/her reasons for denying the<br/>exchange.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All trades must be completed within a given school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a trade is requested which would affect two (2) schools, both building principals must</p>
<p>approve the trade.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member who is responsible for being in that classroom should be absent because of<br/>illness or any other reason, the absence day shall be charged to that unit member and that<br/>member will be responsible for arranging for any substitute required.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial contract unit members will be allowed exchange days within their schedule with the same<br/>provisions.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and/or the Union bear no responsibility for the enforcement of private exchange day<br/>agreements between individual teachers, nor shall the District or Union be liable for the payment<br/>of additional compensation based upon any teacher working beyond his/her regular work year<br/>pursuant to any exchange day agreement.</p>
<p>N. Bank Days</p>
<p>In addition to exchange days, YRE unit members may choose to &quot;bank&quot; days.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To &quot;bank&quot; a day, the unit member must substitute without pay during an off-track day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than five (5) banked days may be accrued or spent within a twelve (12) month period.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banked days shall be credited on a one-to-one (day-to-day) basis.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests must be submitted to the building principal at least five (5) working days prior to<br/>using banked days unless there is a serious emergency. The approval is at the discretion of the</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>principal and shall not be arbitrary, capricious, or without basis in fact. If a request is not<br/>approved, the principal will present, in writing, his/her reason for the denial.</p>
<p>5. The District and/or the Union bear no responsibility for the enforcement of private</p>
<p>exchange/bank day agreements between individual teachers, nor shall the District or Union be<br/>liable for the payment of additional compensation based upon any teacher working beyond<br/>his/her regular work year pursuant to any exchange/bank day agreement.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructured Days.</p>
<p>There will be restructured days at the end of each track change.</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education Services.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Special Services shall work with special education teachers to assure that services<br/>will be provided to special education students on all tracks.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education teachers may choose to work a one hundred and seventy five (175) day (seven<br/>and three-quarters [73.4 ] hour day) flexible schedule only if reflected in student IEP’S and<br/>approved by the Director of Special Services.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 15th, all Special Education Teams (SET) will provide their recommendations for<br/>placement of RSP students by tracks to the site administrator.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXII. HEAD TEACHERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide leadership training for head teachers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job description for head teachers shall be reviewed and revised, if necessary, with the<br/>assistance of the Union.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head teachers shall not evaluate members of the bargaining unit.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXIII. RETIREMENT</p>
<p>A. Pre-Retirement.</p>
<p>The District shall provide the opportunity for a full-time employee to reduce the work year for full¬<br/>time to part-time duties and retain all retirement benefits. The employee would be expected to meet<br/>all the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall have reached the age of fifty-five (55) prior to the first day of the semester in<br/>which part-time employment is requested and shall submit a request in writing to the Human<br/>Resources Dept, ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of the semester in which the pre¬<br/>retirement program is obtained.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of participation in the pre-retirement program shall not exceed ten (10) years. Employees<br/>requesting pre-retirement shall have been employed in the District full-time in a position<br/>requiring certification for at least ten (10) years, including the immediate preceding five (5) years.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall resign at the end of the ten (10] year period.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment shall be exercised at the request of the employee. The<br/>specific assignment shall be a mutual agreement, based upon feasibility, between the employee<br/>and the District. In the event of death, permanent disability, divorce, separation, birth, adoption or<br/>other changes in the employee’s head-of-household status or family status, the employee may<br/>revoke this option, commencing with the ensuing school year and shall give notice in writing to<br/>the District on or before March 1st.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall receive the salary which is a pro rata share of the salary the employee would<br/>be earning if the employee continued in full-time employment and full retirement contributions<br/>shall be paid by the employee and the District, based on the employee’s full-time salary placement.<br/>All leave benefits afforded a full-time employee shall be earned by the part-time employee on a<br/>prorated basis.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee whose service is half-time or more shall receive health and welfare benefits in the<br/>same manner as a full-time employee.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of failing to work at least fifty (50] percent as required by the program can be<br/>significant. This occurs if the member does not earn creditable compensation for at least fifty (50]<br/>percent of full time in any one school year. Service credit for the year will be calculated on actual<br/>time worked.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Retiree-Consultant.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is fifty-five (55] years of age or older with ten (10] years of continuous service,<br/>including Board-approved leave, in the District may, upon retirement, be employed as a consultant<br/>for up to five (5] years or age sixty five (65], whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such retired employee contract shall include terms and conditions agreeable to the employee and<br/>the District, but not to exceed $5,000.00. The per diem rate shall not exceed the current per diem<br/>rate of an employee performing a similar service.</p>

</table><h6>Exhibit C-5</h6><h6>Professional Standards as applied to PRE-ASSISTANCE</h6>
<p>Pre-As si stance is considered to be a signal to certificated staff that additional guidance and support is needed<br/>in maintaining Professional Standards in a particular domain(s). When Pre-Assistance is initiated by the<br/>supervising administrator, it is the responsibility of the administrator, along with certificated staff:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify the specific problem in relationship to Professional Standards.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop and implement a plan for improvement within a period of ten weeks,</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gather selections to show evidence of improvement in Professional Standards.</p>
<p>Throughout Pre-Assi stance the administrator makes a commitment to certificated staff to support the<br/>improvement plan and allow the necessary time for learning new patterns of behavior. The early and<br/>frequent use of Pre-As si stance is viewed as positive support for certificated staff who find themselves with<br/>difficult challenges in their teaching or work.</p>
<p>When a certificated staff member is placed on Pre-Assi stance there is no record of it submitted to his or her<br/>certificated personnel file. Only when certificated staff member is placed on Mandatory PAR is a record<br/>submitted to the permanent file. The period for Pre-Assistance is 10 weeks. The period for Mandatory PAR<br/>is one year. While on Mandatory PAR certificated staff are not eligible to transfer or advance to a higher<br/>step or column on the certificated salary schedule.</p>
<p>When on Mandatory PAR certificated staff will he assigned the support of a consulting teacher through<br/>the PVUSD/PVFT Peer Assistance and Review Program (PAR).</p>
<p>Below are the components of the Pre-Assistance Plan, as per contract:</p>
<p>The supervising administrator will give a written notice to the teacher regarding:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the problem in relationship to Professional Standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the desired behavior in relationship to Professional Standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date when the problem is to be resolved; and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations and assistance that will be given to the teacher</p>
<p>After the written notification is given to the teacher, follow-up observations and conferences between the<br/>teacher and the evaluator will take place. The conferences will result in one of the following actions:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue observations and conferences</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referral to Mandatory PAR</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem resolved and Professional Standards met. Return to current evaluation option.</p>
<p>81</p><h6>Professional Standards as applied to<br/>MANDATORY PAR for Tenured Staff Only</h6>
<p>Certificated staff are referred to Mandatory PAR when staff are unable to meet the goals in a Pre-Assistance<br/>Plan.</p>
<p>When referred to Mandatory PAR certificated staff may appeal the referral.</p>
<p>If an appeal is not requested or if the appeal is not successful, staff is placed on Mandatory PAR and will be<br/>assigned a PAR consulting teacher for one year.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated staff member will remain on the Administrative Option, Mandated the<br/>year following the successful completion of Mandated PAR.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory PAR includes intensified observations and conferences based on<br/>Professional Standards and follows the guidelines of the PVUSD/PVFT PAR Program.</p>
<p>The Mandatory PAR Plan:</p>
<p>The consulting teacher meets with the principal and the referred teacher to develop a plan that includes:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the problem and existing conditions in relationship to Professional Standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific objective(s) for the evaluatee in relationship to Professional Standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific methods and resources which the evaluatee will use to remedy the problem and meet<br/>Professional Standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific guidance and assistance that will be offered to the evaluatee</p>
<p>During the Mandatory PAR :</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting teachers develop reports in consultation with the principal.</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formative Reports are written quarterly and presented to the PAR Governing Panel by the<br/>consulting teacher. The site administrator continues to observe and also attends PAR Governing<br/>Panel meetings to share his/her perspective.</p>
<p>A Summative Report is written and presented to the PAR Governing Panel at the end of the yearlong<br/>Mandatory PAR period by the consulting teacher and the site administrator shares his/her perspectives.</p>
