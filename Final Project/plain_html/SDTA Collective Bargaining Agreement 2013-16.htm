A unit<br/>member who is absent for one-half day or less shall<br/>have deducted one-half day from the accumulated<br/>leave; and, if the absence exceeds more than one-half<br/>day, a full day shall be deducted. Unit members<br/>becoming aware of the need for absence due to<br/>surgery, maternity, or other predictable scheduled cause<br/>shall submit a statement from their attending physician<br/>as far in advance of the initial disability date as possible.<br/>The physician’s statement shall include the beginning<br/>date of disability, the description of the disability, and<br/>the anticipated date of the return to active service.</p>

<p>member who continues to be absent for purposes of<br/>this policy shall receive 50% differential pay, or salary<br/>minus the cost of a substitute, whichever results in a<br/>greater salary, for the remaining portion of the total<br/>absence period not to exceed five (5) continuous school<br/>months.

<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not be allowed to return to<br/>service and shall be charged with one (1)<br/>additional day of sick leave absence if the<br/>employee fails to notify the District of intent to<br/>return to duty one-half (1/2) hour prior to the<br/>dismissal of their class on the preceding work<br/>day, and by such failure of notification a<br/>substitute is secured.</p>

<p>grievance or if no disposition has been made within ten (10)<br/>days of the meeting at Step 1, the grievance may be<br/>transmitted to the Superintendent (or designee).

The written<br/>request shall be filed in the office of the Superintendent<br/>within ten (10) days after receipt of the written decision at<br/>Step 2. The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by an<br/>arbitrator to be selected by the two parties within seven (7)<br/>days after said notice is given.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the<br/>grievance, such question will be ruled upon by the<br/>arbitrator only after the arbitrator has had the<br/>opportunity to hear the merits of the alleged grievance.<br/>In the event that a case is appealed to an arbitrator on<br/>which he has no power to rule, it shall be referred back<br/>to the parties without decision or recommendation on its<br/>merits.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the grievance has been considered by the<br/>parties in the preceding steps of the grievance shall not<br/>constitute a waiver of jurisdiction limitations upon the<br/>arbitrator in this Agreement.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>8. Either party may request a certified court reporter to<br/>record the entire arbitration hearing. The cost of the<br/>services and expenses of such court reporter shall be<br/>paid by the party requesting the reporter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the<br/>arbitrator requests a court reporter, then the costs shall<br/>be shared by both parties.
