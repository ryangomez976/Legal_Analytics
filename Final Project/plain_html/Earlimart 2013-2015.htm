<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to<br/>resolve it by an informal conference with his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level</p>
<p>8.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</p>
<p>8.7.1.1 Within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the<br/>act or omission giving rise to the grievance, or</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>2013-2015 Agreement</p>
<p>8.7.2</p>
<p>8.7.3</p>
<p>within ten (10) days of when a grievant might<br/>have reasonably known of the act or omission<br/>giving rise to the grievance, the grievant shall<br/>present his/her grievance in writing on the<br/>appropriate form (Appendix E) to his/her<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>8.7.1.2 The supervisor shall communicate his/her</p>
<p>decision to the teacher in writing within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the grievance. If the<br/>supervisor does not respond within the time<br/>limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.<br/>Within the above time limits, either party may<br/>request a personal conference.</p>
<p>Level 2</p>
<p>8.7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision<br/>at Level 1, he/she may, within ten (10) days,<br/>appeal the decision on the appropriate form<br/>(Appendix E) to the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee.

<p>Earlimart TA / CTA / NEA</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>2013-2015 Agreement</p>

The<br/>topics discussed or proposals made during mediation shall be<br/>confidential and may not be used by either party in later<br/>proceedings under this Article. If a settlement of the<br/>grievance is achieved through mediation, it shall be reduced<br/>to writing, signed by and binding on both parties. This step<br/>may be waived by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Level 4: Arbitration</p>
<p>8.7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall retain full and complete<br/>authority to determine whether or not a<br/>grievance shall be forwarded for arbitration.</p>
<p>8.7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any question arises as to the arbitrability of<br/>the grievance, such question will be ruled upon<br/>by the arbitrator only after he/she has had an<br/>opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>8.7.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall select a mutually acceptable<br/>arbitrator.

<p>Earlimart TA / CTA / NEA</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>2013-2015 Agreement</p>
<p>written grievance and the answers thereto at<br/>each step.</p>
<p>8.7.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and<br/>will set forth his/her findings of fact, reasoning<br/>and conclusion on the issues submitted. The<br/>arbitrator will be without power or authority to<br/>make any decisions which require the<br/>commission of an act prohibited by law or<br/>which violates the terms of this Agreement.<br/>However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is<br/>empowered to include in any award such<br/>financial reimbursement or other remedies as<br/>he/she judges to be proper.</p>
<p>8.7.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had<br/>an opportunity to make written arguments, the<br/>arbitrator shall submit, within thirty (30)<br/>calendar days to all parties, the written findings<br/>of fact, reasoning and conclusion on the issues<br/>submitted.

If both parties desire a<br/>transcript or if the arbitrator requires a<br/>transcript, the cost of the transcript and court<br/>reporter shall be shared equally between the<br/>parties. Where only one party desires a<br/>transcript, that party shall hire the court reporter<br/>and pay costs of the reporter and the transcript.<br/>No party who fails to pay for the reporter and<br/>transcript shall be entitled to use or cite the</p>

<p>ARTICLE IX: LEAVES</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave</p>
<p>A teacher may be represented at all stages of the grievance<br/>procedure by himself/herself or, at his/her option, by any<br/>Association representative.</p>
<p>When a unit member intends to represent a grievant at any<br/>stage of the grievance procedure prior to arbitration, s/he shall<br/>provide at least twenty-four (24) hours notice in order to be<br/>released without loss of pay. Twenty-four hours notice shall<br/>not be required where the meeting is scheduled by the District<br/>on less than 24 hours notice. In cases of arbitration, any unit<br/>members who intend to participate shall give at least 24 hours<br/>notice in order to be released without loss of pay.</p>
<p>Failure of the grievant and/or Association to adhere to time<br/>requirements of this article shall constitute forfeiture of<br/>further grievance level options; failure of the District to<br/>adhere to time requirements shall constitute authority for the<br/>grievant to proceed to the next higher level. Nothing here,<br/>however, shall preclude the parties from extending the time<br/>requirements, by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>All documents, communications and records dealing with<br/>processing of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance<br/>file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent<br/>or by any member or representative of the Administration or<br/>the Board against any aggrieved party, any party in interest,<br/>any member of the Association, or any other participant in the<br/>grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>

<p>accident or illness leave per school year. A teacher who<br/>exhausts such leave shall be entitled to use his/her sick leave<br/>benefits as provided in this Article. If the teacher continues to<br/>receive workers' compensation while on sick leave, he/she<br/>may elect to use that portion of his/her sick leave which,<br/>when added to the temporary disability compensation, is<br/>equal to his/her regular monthly salary.</p>
<p>9.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total of the teachers' temporary disability indemnity and</p>
<p>the portion of salary due him/her during his/her absence shall<br/>equal his/her salary.</p>

<p>25.1.1 Permanent Teacher Peer Assistance Program: The purpose of<br/>this Program is to provide assistance and renew quality<br/>teaching and offer remediation to permanent teachers whose<br/>performance has been evaluated as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in either<br/>or both teaching methods and instruction by the principal or<br/>designated evaluator. In addition, it shall be the obligation of</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>2013-2015 Agreement</p>
<p>25.1.2</p>
<p>25.1.3</p>
<p>25.1.4</p>
<p>25.1.5</p>
<p>25.1.6</p>
<p>the Panel to report the results of this intervention to the Board<br/>of Education of the District.</p>
<p>This Program shall be limited to addressing those areas of<br/>performance set forth in the evaluation document listed as<br/>&quot;unsatisfactory&quot; encompassed in the areas of subject matter<br/>knowledge, teaching strategies, or both.</p>
<p>Assistance provided by the peer coach shall focus on the<br/>specific areas recommended for improvement by the<br/>participating teacher's evaluator based upon the unsatisfactory<br/>rating or ratings in the performance evaluation that resulted in<br/>the referral to the PAR Program.</p>
<p>Assistance and remedial efforts and activities shall be intense<br/>and multifaceted, and shall be preceded by a conference<br/>between the peer coach and the administrator who evaluated<br/>the teacher. The teacher being referred and the coach will<br/>develop an Individual Learning Plan. If the permanent teacher<br/>so desires, the Association shall provide representation in this<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>The assistance shall be provided by peer coaches under this<br/>Article and shall be closely monitored by the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>The course of assistance shall include the following:</p>
<p>25.1.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent multiple classroom observations by<br/>the peer coach;</p>
<p>25.1.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance specific to the area of teaching<br/>methodology or instruction which has been<br/>evaluated to be &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, or other areas<br/>deemed in need of assistance by the peer coach<br/>during the period of assistance;</p>
<p>25.1.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for the teacher receiving<br/>assistance to observe exemplary practice, either<br/>by the peer coach or other exemplary teachers;</p>

<p>25.1.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference attendance, often in the company of<br/>the peer coach, to facilitate reflection on how<br/>this experience fits into the Individual Learning<br/>Plan;</p>
<p>25.1.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of assistance which the peer coach<br/>and the Panel may provide; and</p>
<p>25.1.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties understand that every possible<br/>subject matter competency may not be available<br/>within the corps of coaches, and therefore, it<br/>shall occasionally be necessary to secure<br/>additional assistance to fully address identified<br/>deficiencies. In such cases, the peer coach shall<br/>maintain prime responsibility for the Individual<br/>Learning Plan, but may function more like a<br/>case carrier who assures the availability of<br/>appropriate resources.</p>
<p>Communication and consultation between the<br/>principal/evaluator and the coach shall be ongoing.</p>
<p>Nothing in this article precludes the principal/ evaluator or<br/>District representative from doing informal or formal<br/>observations nor from notifying the teacher verbally and/or in<br/>writing regarding incidents or events related to the teacher's<br/>fulfillment of his or her professional obligations.</p>
<p>Written peer review reports will be submitted to the Panel by<br/>the Peer Coach every month. The coach will share all written<br/>and verbal evaluation reports during a conference with the<br/>teacher, prior to submission to the Panel. A copy of the<br/>written reports will be provided to the principal/evaluator.</p>
<p>The peer coach shall submit an oral and written final report<br/>regarding the teacher's participation in PAR to the Panel. This<br/>report shall describe the measures of assistance provided to</p>
<p>43 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-2015 Agreement</p>
<p>the teacher and describe the results of the assistance in the<br/>area or areas recommended for improvement. The peer coach<br/>shall give a copy of this report to the participating teacher no<br/>fewer than five (5) days prior to submitting it to the Panel.</p>
<p>The final report shall become a part of the permanent<br/>teacher's personnel file. The teacher shall have the<br/>opportunity to attach his or her comments.</p>
<p>25.1.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and principal/evaluator may be<br/>present for the coach's presentation and will be<br/>given an opportunity to respond to the report.</p>
<p>25.1.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel shall deliberate whether:</p>
<p>25.1.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is now &quot;proficient&quot; in the areas<br/>evaluated, or</p>
<p>25.1.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel and peer coach do not consider that<br/>further assistance and remediation will be<br/>successful with reasons in support of this<br/>conclusion.</p>
<p>25.1.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above, and while the term of this<br/>assistance shall normally be for one school year, the<br/>assistance may be extended to a second year if the Panel<br/>believes progress is being made, although the permanent<br/>teacher may not have returned to a &quot;proficient&quot; level of<br/>performance.</p>
<p>25.1.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel shall deliberate whether:</p>
<p>25.1.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher has satisfactorily fulfilled his/her<br/>PAR requirements or;</p>
<p>25.1.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher has made progress in fulfilling<br/>his/her PAR requirements and the Panel and<br/>coach agree to extend the teacher’s participation<br/>in the Program to a second and final year or;</p>
<p>25.1.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel and peer coach do not consider that<br/>further remediation will be successful. The</p>
<p>Earlimart TA / CTA / NEA</p>

<p>25.3</p>
<p>25.1.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the teacher, coach, nor principal/evaluator may be<br/>present during deliberations of the Panel, which are<br/>confidential. The Panel may request additional information<br/>from any teacher involved in the Program.</p>
<p>25.1.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Panel shall be reported to the teacher, the<br/>coach, the principal/evaluator, and the Association<br/>representative, if requested by the teacher, in conference with<br/>the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>25.1.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel shall report their findings to the Board of<br/>Education.</p>
<p>Voluntary Teacher Peer Assistance Program:</p>
<p>This component shall provide assistance to teachers who volunteer for the</p>
<p>Program. Voluntary peer assistance is available to both permanent and</p>
<p>nonpermanent teachers.</p>

<p>practice may apply to the Program for such assistance on a<br/>confidential basis. The PAR Panel shall have the authority to<br/>accept or reject such referrals.</p>
<p>25.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher is accepted into the PAR Program as a volunteer,</p>
<p>documentation will not be placed into the personnel file only<br/>so long as participation continues on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Peer Assistance and Review Panel</p>
<p>25.3.1 The Program shall be governed by the PAR Panel composed<br/>of five members, a majority of whom shall be certificated<br/>teachers chosen by the Association. The remaining members<br/>of the Panel shall be certificated administrators selected to<br/>serve on the Panel by the Superintendent.

<p>Class D - Bachelors Degree plus 75 semester units or Masters Degree</p>
<p>Class E - Bachelors Degree plus 75 semester units plus Masters Degree</p>
<p>Initial Placement</p>
<p>At the time of initial placement on the salary schedule, teachers shall be given<br/>credit on a year-for year basis for up to fifteen (15) years of prior experience as a<br/>fully credentialed full-time public school teacher. Substitute service, service in a<br/>private school, or service not based upon a regular credential shall not count<br/>towards service credit for salary placement purposes. Teachers shall be<br/>responsible for providing the District appropriate written documentation to<br/>substantiate their prior years of service credit.</p>
<p>Step Advancement</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall advance on the salary schedule as required by law<br/>and this Agreement. As a general rule, bargaining unit members will advance one<br/>step for each year of full-time service to the District. Full-time service is defined<br/>to mean that the unit member worked at least 75% of the number of required duty<br/>days in that school year.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in #5 below, teachers shall be placed on the<br/>appropriate class of the Salary Schedule in accordance with the degrees and<br/>advanced preparation they have completed.</p>
<p>Teachers employed in the District in Class I shall continue to be placed in Class I<br/>until they possess a preliminary credential. Any teacher who is being paid at a rate<br/>higher than Class I Step 1 and who does not possess a valid California teaching<br/>credential shall be frozen at that rate of pay until they acquire the necessary<br/>credential. If a teacher has been &quot;frozen&quot; on the salary schedule in any column,<br/>he/she shall be entitled to a full advancement to the step upon which he/she would<br/>otherwise be placed, at such time as he/she accumulates the necessary</p>

<p>units/degree.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No credit will be given for upper division units taken before the Baccalaureate<br/>Degree is granted, except when such units are clearly designated on the transcript<br/>as post graduate units by the college or university.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon initial employment, salary payments may be delayed until all verifications<br/>are completed and on file.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower division courses earned after employment will be accepted as units beyond<br/>the degree for purposes of advancing on the District salary schedule when the<br/>attainment of such units can be demonstrated as having the potential for<br/>improving the employee's capability to meet the needs of his/her particular<br/>assignment. Prior approval for utilization of such courses shall be obtained from<br/>the District Superintendent, or District form (see Appendix B-l)</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no limit upon the number of units that may be taken during any<br/>school year for purposes of advancement on the District salary schedule.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancement on the salary schedule shall be at the rate of one step for each year<br/>of teaching experience. If a teacher is employed for at least 75% of the school<br/>year, he/she shall be given salary schedule advancement for the following year.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers contemplating salary advancement because of additional course work<br/>shall file with the Superintendent a notice of intention (see Appendix B-l) to do<br/>such work not later than May 1 and must submit legible verification of<br/>appropriate lower division or graduate level units on or before October 10<sup>th</sup> in<br/>order to qualify for such advancement. Only official sealed transcripts will be<br/>accepted by the district. Report cards and unofficial transcripts will not be<br/>accepted.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher must receive a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better or &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;credit&quot; in any college<br/>course while attempting to qualify for a higher classification, or that course shall<br/>not be counted for classification credits.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Conversion - Quarter units are converted to semester units by multiplying the<br/>quarter unit by 2/3.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each teacher by April 1 of each school year a statement<br/>of the number of units that the District has on file for him/her.</p>
