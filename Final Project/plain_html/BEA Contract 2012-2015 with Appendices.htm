The final calendar for the next<br/>school year will be subject to ratification by the Association and<br/>approval of the Board.</p>

If they are not<br/>implemented, the workyear will automatically revert to<br/>the pre-existing 181.5 day workyear unless the parties<br/>agree otherwise.</p>
<p>3.4.5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, maintenance of these two (2) days for any<br/>school year shall be subject to sufficient ongoing state<br/>funding (i.e., to support two additional days of per diem<br/>pay for unit members) such that no contribution of<br/>revenue from the unrestricted general fund is necessary.</p>
<p>In other words, the expense of the two (2) days must be<br/>completely supported by categorical funds available for<br/>this purpose.</p>
<p>3 .4.5.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the necessary categorical revenue support described</p>
<p>above is eliminated or reduced, the two (2) days shall be<br/>eliminated or reduced accordingly, as well as the<br/>corresponding salary for unit members.</p>

Upon request of the grievant, a grievance may be processed during<br/>any days the District Office is open for business provided all relevant parties are<br/>available.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the supervising administrator having immediate<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant(s).</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>

<p>5.3.1.1 Before filing a formal grievance, and within twenty (20) days after the<br/>occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance, or when<br/>the grievant reasonably should have known, the grievant will attempt to<br/>resolve the grievance in a conference with his/her/their immediate<br/>supervisor. The grievant will inform the supervisor that the conference<br/>is the informal level of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>05-02-13 Supt. Office/kd</p>
<p>5.3.2 Formal Level</p>
<p>5.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One. If the grievant(s) is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance at the informal level, and within ten (10) days after the attempt<br/>to resolve the grievance at the informal level, the grievant may file a<br/>formal grievance in writing, on the appropriate form, to her/his/their<br/>immediate supervisor. The form will include statements indicating:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how the grievant has been adversely affected;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the specific section of the contract allegedly violated; and</p>

If<br/>there is insufficient time for either party to schedule and prepare, the<br/>appeal will be scheduled for the following Board meeting. At least three</p>
<p>(3) days prior to the meeting, a copy of the grievance and the decisions</p>
<p>rendered will be made available to the Board members. Any<br/>information provided to the Board will also be given to the grievant.</p>
<p>5.3.3.2 A facilitator, to be selected by the Board, who is versed in problem</p>
<p>solving techniques will ensure that the meeting proceeds consistent with<br/>the following:</p>
<p>5.3.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format must allow for dialogue between the grievant, the<br/>Board and relevant parties to ensure that the Board receives all<br/>pertinent information. All discussions will be &quot;off the record&quot;<br/>to encourage open discussions and protect the interests of all<br/>parties should the issue be submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p>5.3.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant and, a representative if one has been requested<br/>by the grievant, will be provided an opportunity to present a<br/>statement of the issues giving rise to the grievance and the<br/>proposed remedy.</p>

<p>5.3.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance is resolved if a written request for arbitration is<br/>not submitted within ten (10) days after receipt by the grievant<br/>of the decision from the Board;</p>
<p>5.3.4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to requesting a panel of names of arbitrators, the<br/>Association and the superintendent will attempt to agree on an<br/>arbitrator.</p>

<p>Article 7 — Professional Assessment</p>
<p>See side letter of Agreement to form a committee and develop evaluation process 2012-2013</p>
<p>A joint committee of BEA and district administration representatives and ratified on<br/>March 7, 2013 developed the following Professional Assessment policy:</p>
<p>7.1 Conduct of Professional Assessment</p>
<p>7.1.1 The assessment of unit members through the Professional Assessment Article<br/>will be conducted by the site administrator (s) or district administrators, if<br/>appropriate.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time during the assessment process, if the unit member is not in<br/>agreement with the evaluator, a second evaluator, who is acceptable to both<br/>parties, may be invited to participate in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a specialist is assigned to more than one school, the assessment process<br/>will be conducted with one administrator having primary responsibility and<br/>working collaboratively with the unit member's other administrators).</p>
<p>7.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District superintendent will ensure that the evaluators have current<br/>knowledge of and training in the techniques of assessment.</p>
<p>7.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and the<br/>evaluation forms will be included in this contract appendix and were adopted by<br/>BEA and BSD Administrative team. They serve as the basis for evaluation<br/>along with the formation of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable,<br/>Relevant, Time Framed) Goals, classroom observations, and student<br/>achievement.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Assessment for Certificated Personnel</p>
<p>7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of the Assessment</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a periodic assessment of unit members' performance of the<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage unit members toward self-analysis and reflection about teaching<br/>to improve student learning.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To form the basis for constructive discussion between administrators and unit<br/>members, thereby developing mutual understanding and more effective working<br/>relationships that result in a positive teaching and learning environment.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a framework, based on the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession, so that all teachers can improve their practice by working together<br/>with administrators and other teachers.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</p>
<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Standards for the Teaching Profession address the diversity of<br/>students and teachers in California schools today, and they reflect a holistic,<br/>developmental view of teaching.</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professional Assessment is goal driven and reflective process of<br/>assessment.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>05-02-13 Supt. Office/kd</p>
<p>Probationary/Temporary status is for unit members who require more intensive<br/>analysis of teaching as it relates to the standards. Unit members remain<br/>in probationary/temporary status until permanent status is achieved.</p>
<p>Permanent status is designed for professional growth and continuous</p>
<p>improvement of the California Standards for the Teaching Profession,<br/>which includes appropriate colleague, self, parent/student, and<br/>administrative interactions relative to the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>Permanent Status Needs Improvement is for unit members with permanent<br/>status for whom improvement is required. A directed performance<br/>assessment will be conducted for any tenured unit member who has been<br/>designated as “not meeting standard” according to the procedures,<br/>described in this program.</p>
<p>7.3.3 After permanent status is achieved, the formal assessment process occurs in<br/>alternating years based on last digit of even or odd social security number<br/>(beginning with odd number in the 2013 school year).</p>
<p>Process</p>
<p>7.4.1 Probationary/Temporary Teachers</p>
<p>7.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is for unit members in probationary/temporary status who<br/>require more intensive analysis of teaching as it relates to the standards.<br/>This level of review involves maximum administrative attention, and<br/>where helpful, assistance from experienced tenured unit members. Unit<br/>members remain in Probationary/Temporary until permanent status is<br/>achieved.</p>
<p>7.4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Standards for the Teaching Profession are to be used to<br/>inform probationary and temporary unit members of district expectations<br/>and to determine whether or not a unit member should be offered tenure<br/>in the district. Supervisors will use these standards as guidelines for<br/>supervision and support of unit members being considered for<br/>permanent status.</p>
<p>7.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These standards describe outstanding teaching that will promote the<br/>intellectual, personal, and social growth of all students. Teachers,<br/>administrators, parents, and community members believe that, in order<br/>to be granted tenure in the district, unit members should demonstrate the<br/>ability to meet these standards and the commitment to maintain them<br/>throughout their teaching career.</p>

<p>11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the Board to establish the staffing ratio. The District and<br/>Association mutually agree that the current staffing ratio is:</p>
<p>Kindergarten, 4,5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27:1</p>
<p>Grades 1,2, 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20:1</p>
<p>Middle School &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.5:1</p>
<p>11.1.1 The staffing ratio of 20:1 in grades 1, 2 and 3 is pursuant to the state-funded<br/>Class Size Reduction program. In the event that this program’s funding is<br/>reduced the parties agree that the ratio of 27:1 shall apply to grades 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staffing ratio (11.1) pertains to regular classrooms and does not include specialists<br/>for Library Media, Music, English Language Learner, Reading, Special Education and<br/>K-5 P.E. These specialist areas will be staffed at the maximum levels allowed by the<br/>budget and within county and state regulations.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District to staff the schools at the above levels based upon<br/>enrollment projections. The preliminary enrollment projections for the ensuing year<br/>will be discussed in February, and class configurations will be determined by the<br/>principal and unit members at each school site. A preferred configuration and</p>
<p>05-02-13 Supt. Office/kd</p>
<p>alternates based on potential enrollment variations will be developed prior to the last<br/>day of the school year.</p>
<p>11.3.1 Individual school configurations may fluctuate, within District</p>
<p>allocations depending on factors such as, but not limited to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;student welfare</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructional goals</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriateness of educational activity</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;special funding requirements</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multi-graded classes</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differentiated staffing patterns</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grade level enrollments</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approved experimental or pilot programs</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individualized instruction</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flexible scheduling</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team teaching</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will consider adjusting the number of unit members at the school site based<br/>on the Board adopted staffing ratio when the number of unit members at the site differs<br/>by .67 Full-time Equivalent (FTE). When it differs by .50 FTE, the District will<br/>consider hiring a half-time unit member. (Calculation: enrollment divided by staffing<br/>ratio).</p>
<p>11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any adjustment of the staffing ratio will be the decision of the District after<br/>consultation with the Association. If disagreement occurs, the School Board will be<br/>notified in writing of the Association's concerns.</p>
<p>11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide the Association with copies of current class size and staffing<br/>ratio in October, January and April.</p>

<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who will be impacted by full inclusion will receive prior notification,<br/>be afforded the opportunity to participate in the IEP, and review and discuss any<br/>information available that might be useful in preparing for the student. It is important<br/>to ensure that all special needs are identified in the IEP, and it is therefore advisable<br/>that the District's special education director participate in the initial IEP of each student.</p>

<p>05-02-13 Supt. Office/kd</p>
<p>12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classroom teacher receiving the inclusion student will be fully informed<br/>about any known medical needs, and whether or not bathroom assistance is<br/>necessary.</p>
<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is advisable for the classroom teacher to encourage the inclusion of a<br/>provision in the IEP for providing assistance to the student when the aide<br/>assigned to the student is absent and no substitute aide is available.</p>
<p>12.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IEP meetings will be scheduled to minimize before and after school meetings.</p>
<p>If more than eight (8) hours of meetings are required before the start of or after<br/>the end of the student instructional day in a school year, the affected general<br/>education teacher(s) will be compensated pursuant to Section 17.11.4.1 (pg. 53).</p>
<p>12.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion students shall be counted in the calculation of staffing ratios under<br/>section 11.1.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each school with an inclusion student, a full inclusion planning team consisting of<br/>those who may be affected, will be established to ensure that the appropriate resources<br/>and support services, such as a full inclusion aide, defined by the IEP are provided.</p>
<p>12.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each site will determine whether the planning team will be for all site inclusion<br/>issues or whether a team needs to be established for each student.</p>
<p>12.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site full inclusion support team will develop solutions to problems unique<br/>to full inclusion, including, but not limited to: physical space; physical<br/>movement of the student; teacher/parent conferences; parent participation as<br/>indicated in the IEP; provisions for student assistance when the aide is absent<br/>and no substitute is available; and other concerns that may arise.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members impacted by full inclusion will be offered opportunities to participate in<br/>appropriate training necessary for successful implementation. Such training will be<br/>provided during release time or compensated pursuant to Section 17.11.3.3.3 of this<br/>agreement (pg. 53).</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education</p>
<p>12.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher attendance at mandatory District-wide Special Education in-service<br/>meetings shall be in lieu of attendance at District-wide grade level meetings held on the<br/>same day.</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education-related activities such as IEP meetings shall be conducted<br/>during the normal professional workday, whenever feasible.</p>

<p>14.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member fails to endorse to the District any wage loss disability<br/>indemnity check received because of the industrial accident or illness as<br/>provided above, the District will deduct from the unit member's salary warrant<br/>the amount of such disability indemnity actually paid to and retained by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>14.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties to this contract are also aware the provisions of Illness and Injury<br/>Leave [14.3] are also available for District unit members.</p>
<p>14.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member will report to his/her immediate supervisor within 24 hours any<br/>accident to themselves which occurs in connection with their employment. A<br/>written report on the District accident form must be filed with the immediate<br/>supervisor within 72 hours.</p>
<p>14.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member upon return from industrial accident leave will be returned to the<br/>same position they held at the time the leave commenced unless the absence<br/>carries over to a subsequent school year in which case they will be returned to a<br/>similar position. In the case of changing faculty assignment, a unit member<br/>returning from an Industrial Accident Leave will be considered for a teaching<br/>position on an equal basis with all other faculty members at the school site.</p>

<p>14.6 Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>14.6.1 Unit members will be allowed up to six days of accumulated illness or injury</p>
<p>leave [Article 14.3.1] which will not be carried over from year to year, for the</p>
<p>following:</p>
<p>14.6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attendance at the funeral of a member of the unit member's immediate<br/>family or close relative;</p>
<p>14.6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a serious accident involving the unit member's person or property of<br/>the person or property of a member of his/her immediate family. An<br/>emergency accident would involve an unforeseen mishap or property<br/>damage resulting from an unforeseen tragedy or act of destruction;</p>
<p>14.6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an illness of a member of the unit member's immediate family which<br/>is of a serious nature. An illness of a serious nature will be an illness<br/>which a unit member cannot reasonably be expected to disregard and<br/>which requires the attention of the unit member during his/her<br/>assigned hours of service;</p>
<p>14.6.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;family related matters which include, but are not limited to, religious<br/>holiday, attendance at a family wedding, graduation, child's school<br/>conference, or other school function of the child, etc.</p>
<p>14.6.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appearance in court as a litigant or as a witness under official court<br/>subpoena. This provision will not be used for the personal<br/>convenience of the unit member;</p>
<p>14.6.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any unexpected event involving damage or injury to personal<br/>property which has crucial significance for the unit member or his/her<br/>immediate family. The after-math of fire, flood, and burglary are<br/>examples.</p>
<p>14.6.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absence will be allowed to any unit member who has been a victim of<br/>a violent crime.</p>
<p>14.6.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four days of the six personal necessity days as defined above may be<br/>used each school year by unit members for conditions of personal<br/>necessity as deemed appropriate by the unit member.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the requirements of 14.6.3 below, no prior approval<br/>by a supervisor is required in the case of these four days of personal<br/>necessity leave, but notification to the immediate supervisor must<br/>be made in advance of these four days of leave and such<br/>notification will be three days in advance except in cases of<br/>emergency. The four days of unspecified personal necessity leave<br/>may not be accumulated or carried over to a subsequent school year.</p>

<p>05-02-13 Supt. Office/kd</p>
<p>14.6.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after all earned sick leave days at full pay have been used and<br/>additional absence is necessary as specified in 14.6.1.1 through<br/>14.6.1.7, the unit member will receive the difference between his/her<br/>own salary and the day-to-day substitute rate as approved by the<br/>Board of Trustees whether or not a substitute is employed.</p>
<p>14.6.1.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the superintendent or his designee, upon prior application of a unit<br/>member, may grant personal necessity on an individual basis for<br/>reasons other than those stipulated above. If personal necessity days<br/>are denied, the superintendent will notify the applicant in writing<br/>stating reasons for denial within five (5) working days.</p>
<p>14.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee may grant up to two (2) personal necessity days<br/>in addition to the six days provided in section 14.6.1, for use in connection with<br/>a family member's illness as provided in section 14.6.1.3. If personal necessity<br/>days are denied, the superintendent will notify the applicant in writing stating<br/>reasons for denial within five (5) working days.</p>
<p>14.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will request personal necessity leave five days in advance,<br/>except in cases of emergency, and the District reserves the right to require<br/>verification of the reason for the personal necessity leave. Under all<br/>circumstances, a unit member will verify in writing that the personal necessity<br/>leave was used only for the purposes as set forth above. The unit member will<br/>be subject to one day loss of pay for each day of absence if the leave is used for<br/>purposes other than those stipulated.</p>
<p>14.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members, upon return from personal necessity leave, will be returned to<br/>the same position they held at the time the leave commenced.</p>
<p>14.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>14.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence without loss of salary or sick leave will be allowed to any regular unit<br/>member to be used at their discretion, not to exceed four days in connection<br/>with the death of a member of the immediate family, or six days leave of<br/>absence if out-of-state travel is required. In the case of miscarriage/stillbom<br/>suffered by the unit member or the unit member's spouse, an absence not to<br/>exceed three days without loss of salary or sick leave will be allowed.</p>
<p>14.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty Leave</p>
<p>14.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence for jury duty will be provided at the employee’s current salary<br/>rate. In order for an employee to be compensated for jury duty, he or she must<br/>provide the District with the proof of service notice provided by the court.<br/>Currently the court system does not compensate state employees for jury duty,<br/>other than mileage reimbursement. If/when this policy changes, compensation<br/>for jury duty will be provided at a salary which is equal to the difference of the</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>05-02-13 Supt. Office/kd</p>
<p>unit member’s regular earnings and any amount he/she received as juror’s fees<br/>during the period he/she serves on the jury.</p>
<p>14.8.2 Unit members upon return from jury duty leave will be returned to the same<br/>position they held at the time the leave commenced.</p>
<p>14.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Leave</p>
<p>14.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who enter active military service of the United States or of the<br/>State of California or in the service of the Merchant Marines or in the full¬<br/>time paid service of the American Red Cross during a period of national<br/>emergency declared by the President of the United States or during any war in<br/>which the United States is engaged will be entitled to unpaid leave.</p>
<p>14.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members engaged in ordered military or naval duty will receive salary or<br/>compensation equal to one-tenth of the annual salary established for the unit<br/>members in accordance with provision established by Education Code Section<br/>13530.</p>
<p>14.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the military orders or, in the case of the Red Cross service,<br/>evidence of paid service will be provided to the District Office with the<br/>request for military leave.</p>
<p>14.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member returns within six months after having been honorably<br/>discharged from such service or has been placed on inactive duty, the unit<br/>member will have the right of return to the same position he/she held at the<br/>time of entrance into such service.</p>
<p>14.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference Leave</p>
<p>14.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the District believes strongly and supports professional growth, unit<br/>members may request of their immediate supervisor leave for the purpose of<br/>attending professional meetings or conferences when such meetings will result<br/>in direct benefit to the District and the instructional program. The immediate<br/>supervisor will forward those leaves which are recommended to the<br/>superintendent or his designee.</p>
<p>14.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning from conference leave will be returned to the same<br/>position they held at the time the leave commenced.</p>
<p>14.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>14.11.1 After completing seven consecutive full school years of service, a unit<br/>member will be eligible to apply for leave of absence of one year<br/>duration or a split sabbatical totaling one school year for pursuing an<br/>academic program and/or travel approved by the District. Applicants for<br/>sabbatical leave must submit their request on the appropriate District form no</p>
<p>later than February 1 for a leave starting the following school semester or<br/>school year. If a split sabbatical leave is desired, it must be requested at the<br/>time of the application of the first of such leaves.</p>
<p>14.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superintendent may recommend approval of sabbatical leave requests to<br/>the Board of Trustees and the board of Trustees may grant such leaves to a<br/>maximum of 4% of the unit member provided funding for sabbatical leave is<br/>available. Sabbatical leaves will be approved no later than May 1.</p>
<p>14.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on sabbatical leave will receive 50 percent of the salary they<br/>would have been paid during the period of leave based on the appropriate<br/>salary schedule placement which would have been granted had the unit<br/>member not been on leave. No other compensation or benefit will be granted<br/>to those on leave except that unit members may participate, at no charge to the<br/>District, in the district's health benefits program and State Teacher's<br/>Retirement System contributions will be made at the normal rate applied to<br/>the sabbatical leave payments.</p>
<p>14.11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and conditions of the leave will be agreed upon in writing and will<br/>include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an indemnification bond equal to twice the salary received during the<br/>sabbatical leave;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a requirement of service to the District of two full years for each full<br/>year of leave and one full year for each one-half year of leave; and</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate reporting procedures on the values of sabbatical leave as<br/>may be designated by the superintendent.</p>
<p>14.11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members upon return from sabbatical leave will be returned to a similar<br/>position.</p>
<p>14.12 Leave Without Pay</p>
<p>14.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three or more years of service in the District, a unit member may be<br/>granted a leave of absence without pay or other compensation for the purposes<br/>of study, travel, rest, or other reasons acceptable to the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>Such leave will be for one year or less, and will terminate at the end of a<br/>school year. However, such leave may be extended to cover an additional<br/>year as granted by the Board. Notification by the unit member requesting<br/>extension must be submitted to the Board of Trustees by February 1.</p>
<p>14.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in the case of unforeseen and emergency circumstances, the request for<br/>a leave will be made on or before March 1 preceding the scheduled date of<br/>absence in the case of an absence which starts in September and prior to<br/>November 1 in the case of a leave starting in February.</p>
<p>14.12.3 Unit members, upon return from leave without pay, will be returned to a<br/>position with the District for which they are credentialed.</p>

Unit members may submit requests for extensions of<br/>withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A unit member’s<br/>withdrawal from the Bank may not exceed the statutory<br/>maximum period of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>

<p>SMART GOALS - TEMPLATE</p>
<p>SMART goals help improve achievement and success. A SMART goal clarifies exactly what is<br/>expected and the measures used to determine if the goal is achieved and successfully<br/>completed.</p>
<p>A SMART goal is:</p>
<p>Specific (and strategic): Linked to position summary, departmental goals/mission, and/or<br/>overall school/district goals and strategic plans. Answers the questions-Who? What?</p>
<p>Measurable: The success toward meeting the goal can be measured. Answers the question-<br/>How?</p>
<p>Attainable: Goals are realistic and can be achieved in a specific amount of time and are<br/>reasonable. Answers the question-How?</p>
<p>Relevant (results oriented): The goals are aligned with current tasks and projects and focus in<br/>one defined area; include the expected result. Answers the question- Why?</p>
<p>Time framed: Goals have a clearly defined time-frame including a target or deadline date.<br/>Answers the question-When?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Not a SMART goal:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student will improve their writing skills.</p>
<p>Does not identify a measurement or timeframe, nor does it identify why the improvement is<br/>needed or how it will be used.</p>
<p>SMART goal:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By June 2013, 90% of my third grade students will know their multiplication facts from<br/>0-12 with 100% accuracy, as measured by classroom assessments conducted bi-monthly<br/>(provide standard content if applicable).</p>
