<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>

Employees may use up to one-half of their allotted</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>sick leave per year to attend to an illness of a child, parent, spouse or<br/>domestic partner of the employee.</p>
<p>Employees may accumulate unused sick leave without limitation.</p>
<p>6.3 Extended Sick Leave</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year when an employee has exhausted all<br/>available sick leave, including all accumulated sick leave and<br/>catastrophic leave, and continues to be absent from his or her<br/>duties on account of illness or accident for an additional period of<br/>five school months, whether or not the absence arises out of or in<br/>the course of employment, the amount deducted from the salary<br/>due him or her for any of the additional five months in which the<br/>absence occurs shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a<br/>substitute employee employed to fill his or her position during his<br/>or her absence or, if no substitute employee was employed, the<br/>amount that would have been paid to the substitute had he or she<br/>been employed.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of subsection 6.3.1:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the<br/>five-month period shall run consecutively;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be provided more than one five-<br/>month period per illness or accident.

<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee has exhausted all available sick leave,<br/>including accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent on<br/>account of illness or accident for a period beyond the five-month<br/>period provided in subsection 6.3.1, and the employee is not<br/>medically able to resume the duties of his or her position, the<br/>employee shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a re¬<br/>employment list for a period of 24 months if the employee is on<br/>probationary status, or for a period of 39 months if the employee is<br/>on permanent status.</p>
<p>6.4 Verification of Sick Leave Use</p>
<p>Normally, verification will not be required for short term absences. A<br/>doctor’s certification or other acceptable form of verification may be<br/>required however, for absences exceeding five (5) days, situations where</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>there is a doubt as to the employee’s fitness to return to work, or where the<br/>site administrator (or other applicable administrator) has reason to believe<br/>that there may be an abuse of sick leave.</p>

<p>In accordance with Education Code section 44984, industrial accident and</p>
<p>illness leave shall be in effect for all employees according to the following</p>
<p>provisions:</p>

<p>6.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day<br/>of absence.</p>
<p>6.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee is absent from his/her duties on account of an<br/>industrial accident or illness, he/she shall be paid such portion of<br/>the salary due him/her for any month in which the absence occurs<br/>as, when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity under<br/>Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a<br/>payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>6.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one (1) day<br/>for each day of authorized absence regardless of a temporary<br/>disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>6.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next<br/>fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only the amount of<br/>unused sick leave due him/her for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>6.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the<br/>employee shall be entitled to the benefits provided in Education<br/>Code Sections 44977, 44978 and 44983, and for purposes of each<br/>of these sections, the employee’s absence shall be deemed to have<br/>commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or<br/>illness leave, provided that if the employee continues to receive<br/>temporary disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much<br/>of his/her accumulated sick leave which, when added to his/her<br/>temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her<br/>of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The District reserves the right to designate FMLA leave as running<br/>concurrently with industrial accident and illness leave.</p>
<p>6.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the employee may endorse to<br/>the District the temporary disability indemnity checks received on<br/>account of his/her industrial accident or illness. The District, in<br/>turn, shall issue the employee’s appropriate salary warrants for<br/>payment of the employee’s salary and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>6.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee receiving benefits as a result of this section shall,<br/>during periods of injury or illness, remain within the State of<br/>California, unless the Governing Board authorizes travel outside<br/>the State.</p>
<p>6.5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to secure proof of industrial injury<br/>or illness of an employee.

<p>6.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of personal leave is not for purposes of personal<br/>convenience, for the extension of a holiday or vacation period, for<br/>concerted activities or for matters, which can be taken care of<br/>outside of working hours.</p>
<p>6.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall provide advance notification for personal<br/>necessity leave except in urgent situations.</p>

<p>6.7.1 Each full-time employee of the District shall be granted two days<br/>of personal leave (on a full day basis) per year, if needed. The<br/>leave shall be given with full pay. The leave may not be</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>accumulated year to year. It is the intent of the District to provide<br/>full-time employees the opportunity to conduct personal business<br/>during a regular workday.

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves for May and June may be granted on a two (2) per<br/>school per day basis during those months. The<br/>Superintendent and Principal may grant additional leave<br/>under extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>

<p>6.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity Leave</p>
<p>Maternity leave of absence shall be granted to any employee who is<br/>required to be absent from duty because of pregnancy, miscarriage,<br/>childbirth, and recovery therefrom.</p>
<p>The length of the maternity leave, including the date on which the leave<br/>should commence and the date on which the employee shall resume<br/>duties, shall be determined by the employee and her physician, to coincide<br/>if feasible, with the beginning of a term or other appropriate break.</p>
<p>The employee is entitled to use accumulated sick leave, including<br/>extended sick leave, when physically disabled or otherwise incapacitated<br/>from performing duties because of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and<br/>recovery therefrom. After the exhaustion of all paid leave, the employee<br/>will be on unpaid leave status.</p>

The following<br/>provisions, together with the Department of Labor regulations<br/>implementing the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993<br/>(&quot;FMLA&quot;), the regulations of the California Fair Employment and<br/>Housing Commission implementing the California Rights Act (&quot;CFRA&quot;)<br/>(Government Code § 12945.2) and the District's FMLA</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Policy/Regulations, define the rights and obligations of unit members in<br/>connection with Family and Medical Care Leave. Unless otherwise<br/>provided by this section, leave under this section shall mean leave<br/>pursuant to the FMLA and CFRA.</p>
<p>6.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible teachers are entitled to a total of 12 work weeks of leave<br/>during a 12 month period. A member's entitled to leave for the<br/>birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care<br/>expires 12 months after the birth or placement. The 12 month<br/>period for calculating leave entitlement will be a &quot;rolling period&quot;<br/>measured backward from the date leave is taken and continues<br/>with each additional leave day taken. Thus, whenever a member<br/>requests leave, the District will look back over the previous 12<br/>month period to determine how much leave has been used in<br/>determining how much leave a member is entitled to.</p>

<p>6.14 Catastrophic Leave Program</p>
<p>6.14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee or a member of his/her immediate family<br/>experiences a catastrophic illness or injury which requires the<br/>employee to take time off from work for an extended period of<br/>time, and the employee has exhausted all available sick leave and<br/>other paid time off, he/she may request donations of accrued sick<br/>leave credits. (Education Code 44043.5)</p>
<p>6.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation</p>
<p>The Hope District Teachers’ Association (HDTA) and the District,<br/>acting for all unit members (full and part-time certificated<br/>employees), have created a Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be funded in accordance with<br/>the terms below.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this section, a &quot;day&quot; shall be any day a unit<br/>member is expected to be on duty as determined by the terms of<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>Certificated employees who are retiring from the District may<br/>contribute up to ten (10) days of unused sick leave to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall remain/roll over from<br/>year to year.</p>
<p>Days shall be contributed and withdrawn from the Bank without<br/>regard to the daily rate of pay of the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>participant.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by the<br/>executive board of the Hope District Teachers’ Association<br/>(HDTA) who shall serve as the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>6.14.3 Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>All permanent unit members on active duty with the District are<br/>eligible to contribute to the Catastrophic Leave Bank. Unit<br/>members are eligible to participate if they are permanent or have<br/>been consecutively employed for more than two years and have<br/>contributed at least one day of sick leave to the bank.</p>
<p>Participation is voluntary and in compliance with the provisions of<br/>Education Code section 44043.5.</p>
<p>The donating unit member must, after the donation, retain a<br/>minimum of one year’s worth of their sick leave. Full time<br/>donating members, therefore, must retain ten (10) days of<br/>accrued, unused sick leave from prior accumulations. Donating<br/>unit members working 50% time must, after the donation, retain<br/>a minimum of five (5) days of accrued, unused sick leave from<br/>prior accumulations. Donating unit members working 60% time<br/>must, after the donation, retain a minimum of six (6) days of<br/>accrued, unused sick leave from prior accumulations. This<br/>calculation will be pro-rated to correspond with the work<br/>schedule of other part-time employees as well.</p>
<p>Contribution to the Catastrophic Leave Bank, on the appropriate<br/>form, shall be authorized by the unit member. The donating unit<br/>member shall execute and file with the District a form authorizing<br/>and irrevocably assigning the donated day(s) to the bank.</p>
<p>Donated sick leave not utilized by an employee shall remain in the<br/>bank.</p>
<p>Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to the bank shall<br/>not be returned if the unit member is released or resigns from the<br/>district for any reason.</p>
<p>The minimum rate of contribution by each unit member shall be<br/>one (1) day of sick leave which shall be deemed to equate to the<br/>legal minimum required by Education Code Section 44043.5.</p>
<p>The catastrophic leave bank shall not accrue more than 150 days.</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>A unit member whose sick leave is exhausted may withdraw from<br/>the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury, provided he/she has<br/>donated at least one full day of leave to the catastrophic leave<br/>bank prior to the illness/injury. Non-industrial catastrophic illness<br/>or injury shall be defined as any illness or injury to the unit<br/>member or an immediate family member, which has caused the<br/>unit member to be incapacitated from the performance of duty and<br/>is expected to incapacitate the unit member for an extended<br/>period of time. (Reference Education Code section 44043.5)</p>
<p>Unit members must use all of the following paid leaves: sick leave,<br/>personal necessity leave and personal business leave (but not<br/>differential leave), available to them before becoming eligible for a<br/>withdrawal from the Bank. Unit members shall be eligible to apply<br/>for a discretionary paid leave of absence under the Catastrophic<br/>Leave program. Such leave is intended to provide emergency<br/>financial support and to relieve financial hardship in situations<br/>where a serious illness or injury (which is not compensable under<br/>other paid provisions such as workers compensation, SDI, or<br/>disability) incapacitates a unit member or a member of the unit<br/>member’s immediate family requiring the employee to be absent<br/>from work for an extended period of time to care for that family<br/>member. Eligible family members include spouse, dependent<br/>family members (children, step children, foster children), parents<br/>and domestic partners. An employee may request leave for a<br/>family member who is not listed in this paragraph. Each request<br/>will be considered based upon the specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Unit members who qualify and desire this benefit shall submit to<br/>the Committee, on a form, a request for donated sick leave days<br/>which shall include a verification of the catastrophic illness or<br/>injury by means of a letter dated and signed by the treating<br/>medical practitioner, indicating the incapacitating nature and<br/>probable duration of the illness/injury. Upon receipt of the request,<br/>verification by the District, and authorization to release medical<br/>information to the Committee, the Association shall be allowed, if<br/>there are not enough days held in the bank, to circulate a request<br/>for sick leave donations to be submitted to the District. The<br/>request will include the number of days presently available in the<br/>bank.</p>
<p>Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in<br/>units of no more than 30 duty days. Unit members may submit<br/>requests for extensions of withdrawals as their prior grant expires.<br/>A unit member may submit an extension request up to two times<br/>per illness. (A maximum total of 90 days).</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank cannot be used for an illness or<br/>injury that qualifies the participant for Workers Compensation</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Benefits unless the participant has exhausted all Workers<br/>Compensation Benefits.</p>
<p>The Association agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the<br/>District from any loss or damages arising from the implementation<br/>of the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>If a unit member has drawn 30 Catastrophic Leave Bank days and<br/>requests an extension, the Committee may require a medical<br/>review by a physician of the Committee's choice at the unit<br/>member’s expense. The Committee shall choose only a physician<br/>who qualifies under the negotiated insurance policy. Refusal to<br/>submit to the medical review will terminate the unit member’s<br/>continued withdrawal from the Bank. The Committee may deny an<br/>extension of withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank based<br/>upon the medical report. The participant may appeal to the<br/>executive board of the association any termination under the<br/>procedures outlined above.</p>
<p>If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to<br/>fund a withdrawal request, the Committee is under no obligation to<br/>provide days and the District is under no obligation to pay the<br/>participant any funds whatsoever. If the Committee denies a<br/>request for withdrawal, or an extension of withdrawal, because of<br/>insufficient days to fund the request, they shall notify the unit<br/>member, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the<br/>exhaustion of sick leave. If the unit member had fifteen days of<br/>sick leave at the beginning of the illness, she/he shall begin<br/>withdrawing days on the 16th duty day.</p>
<p>6.14.5 Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee shall have the<br/>responsibility of receiving requests, verifying the validity of<br/>requests, approving or denying the requests, and communicating<br/>its decisions, in writing, to the unit member, to the Association,<br/>and to the District.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee is responsible for all<br/>denials or terminations. The decision of the Committee is final.</p>
<p>Applications shall be reviewed and decisions of the Committee<br/>reported to the applicant, in writing, within ten (10) duty days of<br/>receipt of the application.</p>
<p>The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not<br/>disclose the nature of the illness except as is necessary to</p>
<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>process the request for withdrawal and defend against any<br/>appeals of denials.</p>
<p>Any dispute between the Committee and the District as to the<br/>accounting of Catastrophic Leave Bank days shall be immediately<br/>submitted to binding arbitration without the need to follow earlier<br/>steps of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank will be reviewed at the end of each<br/>year when activity has occurred to determine needed adjustments.</p>

<p>337396.1 H0060-008</p>
<p>25</p>

<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may request a transfer by following procedures specified<br/>below.</p>
<p>11.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers may become necessary when programs are<br/>reduced or cancelled, schools are closed or transfers are otherwise<br/>required to accommodate each school's teacher needs.
