Such freedom should be used judiciously and prudently to the<br/>end that it promotes the free exercise of intelligence and pupil learning.</p>
<p>4.402 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic freedom is not an absolute. It must be exercised within the law and the<br/>basic ethical responsibilities of the teaching profession. Those responsibilities<br/>include:</p>

<p>4.502 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall be entitled to full rights of citizenship, and no religious or<br/>political activities of any employee or the lack thereof shall be grounds for any<br/>discipline or discrimination with respect to the professional employment of such<br/>employee, providing said activities do not violate any local, state, or federal laws.</p>

<p>Any unit member making payments as set forth in sections 3 and 4 above, and<br/>who requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement be<br/>used in his or her behalf, shall be responsible for paying the reasonable cost of<br/>using said grievance or arbitration procedures.</p>
<p>With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to sections 1 and 2<br/>above, whether for membership dues or agency fees, the District agrees promptly<br/>to remit such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of<br/>unit members for whom such deductions have been made, categorizing them as<br/>to membership or non-membership in the Association, and indicating any<br/>changes in personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>

<p>The Association agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the District harmless<br/>against any and all costs, claims or suits instituted against the District which<br/>allege illegality or unconstitutionalify arising from its compliance with the<br/>provisions of this Article. The Association shall have the exclusive right to<br/>decide and determine which matters shall or shall not be compromised, resisted,<br/>defended, tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>The District shall not be obligated to put into effect any new or changed<br/>deductions until the pay period commencing thirty (30) days after such<br/>submission. <sup>11</sup></p>

To this end, the counselors aim<br/>their services. Counseling has been described as the face to face meeting of the counselor and<br/>counselee. Within the guidance services, counseling may be thought of as the core of the<br/>helping process, essential for the proper administering of assistance to students as they<br/>attempt to experience themselves in all spheres. It is the counselor's duty to assist the students<br/>in achieving a level of self-awareness so that the students can make good decisions and<br/>optimum use of their academic preparation. To do this, counselors encourage students to seek<br/>counseling services outlined below and work collectively with other school personnel to<br/>satisfy needs of each individual student.</p>

<p>including education, employment, financial aid, and independence. In addition, students are<br/>involved in a wide variety of tasks - completing graduation requirements, participating in<br/>various testing programs, and applying for schools, employment, training and financial aid.</p>

<p>Career Guidance Counselor</p>
<p>8.29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy</p>
<p>The Career Guidance Counselor plays a central role in a career education program. It is<br/>his/her duty to assist the student in achieving such a level of personal awareness that the<br/>student can make good decisions, arrive at a personally meaningful set of work values, and<br/>make optimum use of his/her academic preparation. In addition, the career guidance<br/>counselor can be instrumental in ensuring that students are equipped with career decision<br/>making skills, job seeking and retention skills, inter-personal skills that will allow them to<br/>succeed at work, adequate career information and awareness of educational-vocational<br/>opportunities. The student should also have an awareness of the means available for changing<br/>career choices and the social and personal constraints that impinge upon career alternatives.</p>

<p>Calendar</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a traditional/modified traditional calendar work year, the teacher work year will be 184<br/>teacher work days with 180 student instructional days. One full teacher work day will be<br/>dedicated to district professional development.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year-round calendar shall include 175 work days with 171 student instructional days.</p>
<p>The configuration of the time will be arranged in such a fashion as to maximize the<br/>educational advantage to students. Instructional time will be available to local schools to use<br/>for concentrated efforts in basic skill training, including but not limited to mathematics<br/>instruction, training, language instruction, testing skills, and reading instruction. The District<br/>shall provide assistance in curriculum materials to minimize the preparation responsibility for<br/>the classroom teacher. Before a decision is made concerning the appropriate instructional<br/>program, a collaborative effort will be made with local staffs. One full teacher work day will<br/>be dedicated to district professional development. If a professional development day cannot<br/>be scheduled immediately before or after a track change day, then affected off-track teachers<br/>will be offered an alternative staff development day which is immediately before or after a<br/>track change day.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall not be required to perform services for the Board, including but not limited to<br/>attendance at Board workshops, tours, or civic meetings, for more than three school days for<br/>year round and four days for traditional/modified traditional adjacent to the school year.</p>

<p>Working Conditions</p>
<p>Physical Environment</p>
<p>The physical environment within which instruction occurs should contribute rather than<br/>interfere with the educational process. Within the financial limitations of the district and the<br/>facility limitations at each school, principals and staff will work together to provide the best<br/>possible environment for teaching and learning. The District's goal is to gain recognition from<br/>the Association that it often has limited options in resolving facility problems and has and<br/>will make good faith efforts to resolve facility issues. The mechanism for dealing with facility<br/>issues will be an EGEA advisory committee which will advise the District of problems and<br/>work with the District for resolution.</p>
<p>Safety</p>
<p>10.201 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School facilities shall be available for safe use at least one week prior to the first<br/>day of required student attendance.</p>
<p>10.202 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated personnel shall not be required to work under unsafe conditions or to<br/>perform tasks which endanger their health, safety, or well being.</p>
<p>Preparation Time</p>
<p>10.301 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each 7-12 regular classroom teacher unit member shall have one preparation<br/>period daily. Where this contract provides for preparation time within the<br/>instructional day, (Article 8, Section 8.201 e.) rules and regulations will provide<br/>for the use of such time.</p>
<p>10.302 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher preparation periods will not be available for administrative assignment.</p>
<p>10.303 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When modifications in school schedules make classrooms unavailable to<br/>teachers, suitable space for preparation and work will be provided.</p>
<p>10.304 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Service Work Day Meetings: Site level administrators will make every<br/>attempt to limit large group faculty meetings to four hours during the second pre¬<br/>service work day. If special circumstances warrant additional meeting time that<br/>day, the principal will consult with the staff in an attempt to leave adequate time<br/>for individual teacher preparation, grade level and/or department meetings,<br/>classroom preparation and other concerns.</p>
<p>Facilities</p>
<p>10.401 The Board shall provide certificated personnel with:</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A convenient place in which personal belongings can be secured.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate chalkboard/whiteboard space or overhead projection facilities for<br/>instruction.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to basic reference materials.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate storage space in each classroom for current instructional materials.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate attendance books, paper, pencils, pens, chalk, erasers, and other<br/>such materials required in daily teaching responsibility.</p>
<p>10.402 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the purpose of the Board to make available in each school adequate<br/>lunchroom, restroom, and lavatory facilities exclusively for personnel use.<br/>Provision for such facilities will be made in all future buildings.</p>
<p>10.403 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telephone facilities shall be made available to certificated personnel for school<br/>purposes.</p>
<p>10.404 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate off-street parking facilities shall be provided and properly maintained<br/>and identified as being for use of school personnel.</p>
<p>10.405 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The custodial schedule will be designed so that rooms are kept clean. This<br/>recognizes that some instructional programs require more custodial time and/or<br/>personnel than other instructional programs. Rooms will be cleaned according to<br/>need rather than according to the clock.</p>
<p>10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerical and Bookkeeping Activities</p>
<p>The Board agrees to seek ways which will result in reduction of clerical and bookkeeping<br/>activities by certificated personnel.</p>
<p>10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Budget Development</p>
<p>Within the per pupil allowance and existing staff ratios, the District agrees that faculty input<br/>must be included in school budgetary development in order to assure that supplies and<br/>equipment are provided to prepare instructional materials needed by the staff.</p>
<p>10.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severely Handicapped Students</p>
<p>Every effort will be made to balance the number of severely handicapped students who are<br/>assigned to general education classrooms for their primary placement among elementary<br/>classrooms.</p>

<p>Involuntary Transfers Due to Staff Reduction</p>
<p>11.401 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a school site must reduce its staff and no unit member volunteers to<br/>transfer, the district has the right to transfer from the unit members, the unit<br/>member with the least district-wide seniority.</p>

<p>round is completed, another meeting will be held with a school or a department<br/>to finalize required downsizing and seek volunteers for open positions. An<br/>EGEA Representative and an Human Resources administrator will cooperatively<br/>conduct these meetings. If there are more volunteers than needed, 11.307 will be<br/>followed.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13</p>
<p>Certificated Personnel Evaluation</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>13.101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of evaluation is the improvement of the instructional program and<br/>services and thereby the improvement of the quality of education for children,<br/>youth, and adults, as well as compliance with the Education Code.</p>
<p>13.102 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation shall be a comprehensive one based upon a district-wide statement of<br/>philosophy and goals and standards of expected progress. The program will be<br/>uniform throughout the district.</p>
<p>13.103 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment shall apply to all unit members.</p>
<p>13.104 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of professional personnel under this program shall be<br/>a continuous, year-round process. A copy of the district calendar and schedule for<br/>the evaluation of teachers shall be posted on the faculty bulletin board of each<br/>school within three (3) weeks of the first day of student attendance of each year.<br/>This calendar shall not be changed during the school year of its posting.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria</p>
<p>Evaluation and assessment of the competence of certificated personnel under this program<br/>shall include but shall not be limited to consideration of (a) the progress of pupils toward<br/>established standards of expected achievement, (b) the instructional techniques and strategies<br/>used by the employee, (c) the employee's adherence to curricular objectives, and (d) evidence<br/>regarding proper control and the preservation of suitable learning environment. Appropriate<br/>forms shall be developed for the collection of data pertaining to the factors herein specified.</p>
<p>13.201 The District and EGEA agree to incorporate the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession into the Evaluation forms beginning July 1, 2002.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>13 .301&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for the evaluation and assessment of certificated personnel may</p>
<p>involve more than one evaluator. However, one person shall be designated as the<br/>evaluator with responsibility for making the summary assessment report in<br/>writing and submitting a copy to the certificated person assessed.</p>
<p>The evaluator making the actual report shall arrange a conference before the end<br/>of the school year with the person evaluated to discuss the evaluation. He/she<br/>shall then file in the records of the evaluatee a statement regarding the conference<br/>with a copy of the written assessment and any written response the evaluatee may<br/>wish to submit. The certificated employee may submit a written response within<br/>fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the evaluation.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>13.302 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each person evaluated shall have the opportunity to participate in the setting of<br/>the specific objectives and achievement appraisal in light of which he/she will be<br/>assessed.</p>
<p>13.303 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluator shall meet with the evaluatee, at the evaluatee's request, concerning<br/>the desired outcome of the specific educational setting to be evaluated.</p>
<p>13.304 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written evaluations and the summary assessment report of such certificated<br/>employee shall include descriptions of unsatisfactory performance, if any, with<br/>specific recommendations for means of improvement. The evaluator shall<br/>thereafter confer with the employee and endeavor to assist the employee in areas<br/>of unsatisfactory performance. A record of such conferences shall be prepared by<br/>the evaluator for the file of the evaluatee and a copy submitted to the employee.<br/>An employee may elect to include a unit member at a second and succeeding<br/>evaluation conference if the first evaluation conference is unsatisfactory to the<br/>evaluatee.</p>
<p>13.305 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention is called to specific provisions of the statute not repeated herein:<br/>written evaluations and assessments shall be transmitted to the employee not later<br/>than thirty (30) days before the last school day on the school calendar in which it<br/>takes place; a written assessment of probationary personnel shall be made at least<br/>once each school year and at least once every other year for personnel with<br/>permanent status, and at least every five (5)years for personnel with permanent<br/>status who have been employed at least ten (10) years with the school district, are<br/>highly qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801, and whose previous<br/>evaluations rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if the<br/>evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree. The certificated<br/>employee or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time.</p>
<p>13 .306 The forms and procedures for evaluation shall be developed in accord with the<br/>above. A common evaluation form will be developed which will recognize the<br/>diverse responsibilities of the various classes of certificated personnel. These<br/>forms shall be developed by the district in consultation with the Association.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope</p>
<p>13.401 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator and the evaluatee will each select one standard from the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) for focus in the evaluation.</p>
<p>13.402 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These predetermined areas of focus will contain the most in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>13.403 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation will be limited to evaluative judgments (e.g. “meet or does not<br/>meet standard”) for only those two selected CSTP’s, and the overall summative<br/>evaluation will be based upon only those two selected standards.</p>
<p>13.404 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evaluator determines there is an additional issue that in his or her sole<br/>judgment requires an additional CSTP to be evaluated, the evaluator upon notice<br/>to the evaluate may add one additional CSTP. Such notice shall either be in<br/>writing or via email to the evaluatee’s district email address delivered prior to the<br/>close of business on the last school day before Winter Break for that site or<br/>program, regardless of the track or work calendar of the evaluatee. In this case,<br/>each of the three CSTP’s may then contain evaluative comments, and the<br/>summary evaluation shall then be based upon the three selected CSTP’s.</p>
<p>13.5</p>
<p>13.405 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of a 5-year evaluation cycle, evaluative judgments (meets and exceeds<br/>or does not meet) may be made, in up to six CSTP’s, in addition to the<br/>summative evaluation with an emphasis on the two standards.</p>
<p>13.406 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early termination of the 5 year cycle because of an administrator concern will<br/>activate the rules governing the two year cycle.</p>
<p>13.407 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator is not in any way limited or restricted from making comments,<br/>offering evidence or stating the impact resulting from the evaluatee’s need for<br/>improvement, calling attention to deficiencies in practices or performance, or<br/>from making any other comments in the CSTP’s not selected for evaluation.<br/>However, the evaluator is precluded from making evaluative judgments (e.g.</p>
<p>“met or did not meet standard”) regarding those CSTP’s.</p>
<p>13.408 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work plans shall be derived from the CSTP’s being evaluated. However, a work<br/>plan for one or more CSTP’s does not limit or prevent the evaluator from<br/>selecting different CSTP’s in a subsequent year’s evaluation. Work plans may<br/>have requirements regarding remediation activities in the year or years following<br/>an evaluation and the activities specified are independent of the standards<br/>selected from the subsequent evaluation.</p>
<p>13.409 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current evaluation form shall be modified by the addition of a summative<br/>check box that states, “If concerns exist regarding standards other than those<br/>being evaluated - Evaluation in all six standards may be required next year”.</p>
<p>13.410 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in Section 13.4, titled “Scope”, apply to permanent (tenured)<br/>teachers only.</p>
<p>13.411 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary temporary staff will be evaluated in all six CSTP areas.</p>
<p>13.412 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation documents and job descriptions will be modified based upon adopted<br/>changes to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>

<p>Grievances pertaining to this article shall be limited to the procedures herein.</p>

<p>15.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If criminal or civil proceedings are brought against an employee alleging that he/she<br/>committed an assault in connection with his/her employment, such employee may request the<br/>district to furnish legal counsel to defend him/her in any civil action or proceeding brought<br/>against him/her, within the limits set by law.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 16</p>
<p>Complaints</p>
<p>16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>16.101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expressing its faith in the competence of the district's personnel, it is the policy<br/>of the Elk Grove Unified School District to maintain the highest quality of<br/>education and to encourage free and open communication from individuals or<br/>groups within the community regarding compliments, suggestions, and<br/>complaints about any part of the school program or any employee of the school<br/>district.</p>
<p>16.102 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the community will be encouraged to register such communication<br/>with the appropriate office. However, this is not to be construed as inhibiting<br/>anyone's right to contact board members directly. The board member shall direct<br/>the individual to the appropriate office.</p>
<p>16.103 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall develop administrative procedures in support of these<br/>policies and take appropriate action to communicate board policy and procedures<br/>to the entire community.</p>
<p>16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Materials</p>
<p>16.201 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens of the school community may register their criticism with the school<br/>authorities. All criticism must be presented in writing on the district form.</p>
<p>16.202 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questioned material shall not be removed from student use until the committee<br/>has reached a decision unless the principal believes the materials are<br/>inappropriate for usage pending committee determination.</p>
<p>16.203 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A district committee will evaluate the materials being questioned and make<br/>recommendations concerning it. Membership in the district committee to handle<br/>challenged or questioned materials will consist of the administrator involved, the<br/>librarian involved, a parent representative, the department head, or another<br/>classroom teacher and the district multi-media person.</p>
<p>16.204 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of questioned materials should be treated objectively, unemotionally, and<br/>as an important routine action. Every effort should be made to meet with those<br/>persons or groups questioning school materials to consider their objections,<br/>keeping in mind the best interests of the students, the community, the school and<br/>the curriculum, and to bring about a meeting of minds of the question under<br/>consideration.</p>
<p>16.205 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the committee should be completed as rapidly as possible. The<br/>committee's recommendation shall be sent in writing to the complainant.</p>
<p>16.206 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school authorities may call in representative citizens of the community or the<br/>school for consultation.</p>

<p>16.302 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district administration shall cooperate with the complainant and aid in the<br/>preparation of any formal complaint, so as to quickly and easily meet the<br/>informational requirements of these rules. Copies of these rules regarding the<br/>submission and handling of all such complaints shall be made freely available.</p>
<p>16.303 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a complaint is made directly to the Governing Board as a whole or to<br/>the Governing Board member as an individual, it shall be referred to the<br/>Superintendent who will request a written statement of the complaint from the<br/>complainant as a basis for study and possible solutions. The individual employee<br/>involved shall receive a copy of the complaint and shall be given every<br/>opportunity for explanation, comment, and presentation of the facts as he/she<br/>sees them.</p>
<p>16.304 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it appears necessary, the Superintendent, the person who made the complaint,<br/>or the employee involved may request an executive session of the Governing<br/>Board for the purposes of fuller study and a decision by this body. The employee<br/>may request that the matter be heard in public. All parties involved, including the<br/>school administration, shall be asked to attend such a meeting for the purposes of<br/>presenting facts, making explanations, and/or clarifying the issues. (Gov. Code<br/>54957)</p>
<p>16.305 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hearing (subject to the exception in 16.305), whether in executive session or<br/>in public, shall be held by the Governing Board on such a complaint without the<br/>Governing Board and the employee(s) first having received from the<br/>Superintendent his written report concerning such complaint, such report to<br/>include but not be limited to the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of each employee involved.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summary of the nature of the complaint and the facts<br/>surrounding same, sufficient to inform the Governing Board and the<br/>employee as to the precise nature of the complaint, and to allow the<br/>employee to prepare a defense.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A true copy or the signed original of the complaint, itself.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of the action taken by the Superintendent in connection with the<br/>complaint, which summary shall include his specific finding that effective<br/>disposition at the Superintendent's level is infeasible, and the reasons thereof.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>16.306 Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16.304 above, any written complaint<br/>forwarded to the Governing Board, whether by the district administration or<br/>otherwise, which meets the informational requirements of the above sections, and<br/>which further contains within it specific allegations of (a) prior submission of the<br/>complaint in the same or similar form to the Superintendent, and (b) the failure or<br/>refusal of the Superintendent to effectively dispose of the complaint, shall,<br/>subject to Governing Board agenda requirements, be heard by the Governing<br/>Board at its next regularly scheduled session or any session scheduled for the<br/>purpose of such hearing.</p>

<p>Maternity Leave</p>
<p>18.1101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may use sick leave for a temporary disability resulting from<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage or recovery. It is required that a disability statement from<br/>a licensed physician be submitted to the Human Resources Department which<br/>verifies the duration of the disability. Upon such verification, the unit member<br/>shall be entitled to use his/her sick leave for the above.</p>
<p>18.1102 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall receive an unpaid leave for pregnancy, miscarriage or<br/>recovery, provided such leave shall not exceed one (1) calendar year.</p>
<p>18.1103 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for the above leaves shall be submitted to the Human Resources<br/>Department at least four (4) weeks prior to the anticipated date on which the<br/>leave is to commence.</p>
<p>Parental Leave</p>

<p>In addition, a unit member may choose to use their accrued and unused sick leave after the<br/>unit member’s parental leave is over, but before their Family Medical Leave Act leave runs<br/>out. This additional sick leave usage shall be deducted from the unit member’s sick leave<br/>balance.</p>
<p>Child Rearing Leave</p>
<p>A unit member who is a natural or adopting parent may be granted an unpaid leave for child<br/>rearing which shall not exceed one (1) calendar year. Requests for such leave shall be made</p>

<p>18.14 Family And Medical Leave</p>
<p>18.1401 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LENGTH OF LEAVE ENTITLEMENT: An eligible employee is entitled to a<br/>total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period. Entitlement to leave<br/>for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care expires 12 months<br/>after the birth or placement.</p>
<p>The 12-month period is measured backward from the date of leave use. All leave<br/>usage which qualified under the terms of the FMLA leave shall be counted<br/>towards the available 12 workweeks within a 12-month period, including<br/>intermittent and reduced workload leaves.</p>
<p>Reduced workload leave entitlement is calculated on cumulative hours of leave<br/>taken, up to the number of hours equivalent to 12 times the number of hours<br/>normally worked weekly.</p>
<p>18.1402 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LENGTH OF EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY: Any employee who has been<br/>employed for at least 12 months AND who has been in a paid status for at least<br/>1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the<br/>commencement of the leave is eligible for Family Medical Leave.</p>
<p>18.1403 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBLE PURPOSES: Leaves for any of the following purposes qualify for<br/>Family Medical Leave.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of a child of an employee, and to care for a newborn;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The placement of a child with an employee in connection with adoption or<br/>foster care of a child by an employee;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave to care for a child, parent, or spouse who has a serious health<br/>condition; or</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave because of serious health condition that makes the employee unable to<br/>perform the essential functions of his/her position.</p>
<p>Both father and mother may take leave for the birth, or placement for adoption or<br/>foster care, of a child. In addition, an expectant mother may be entitled to leave<br/>prior to the birth of a child for prenatal care purposes if her condition makes her<br/>unable to work. Circumstances may also require leave prior to the actual<br/>placement of a child for adoption or foster care. For example, to attend<br/>counseling session, appear in court or consult with his/her attorney in connection<br/>with the placement of a child.</p>
<p>If both the husband and wife are employed by the District, the aggregate number<br/>of workweeks of leave to which both are entitled is limited to 12 workweeks<br/>during any one fiscal year for the birth or placement for adoption or foster care of<br/>the employees' child, or to care for a parent with a serious health condition. This<br/>limitation does not apply to leave taken by either spouse to care for the other who<br/>is seriously ill and unable to work, to care for a child with a serious health<br/>condition, or for his or her own serious illness.</p>
<p>Leave to care for a family member includes both physical and psychological<br/>care, including providing comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a<br/>seriously ill child or parent receiving inpatient care; or making arrangements for<br/>third-party care of a family member.</p>
<p>A &quot;serious health condition&quot; includes an illness, injury, impairment, or physical<br/>or mental condition that involves:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any period if incapacity or treatment in connection with or in consequent to<br/>a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school or regular<br/>daily activities of more than three calendar days, that also involved<br/>continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider;<br/>or</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or long-term<br/>health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would<br/>likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three calendar days or for<br/>prenatal care.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing supervision by a health care provider when the parent, child,<br/>spouse or employee are severely ill but may not be receiving continuing<br/>active care or treatment (e g., when suffering from Alzheimer's, late stages of<br/>cancer or a severe stroke).</p>
<p>&quot;Continuing treatments&quot; include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or more visits to a health care provider;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or more treatment by a health care practitioner (e.g., physical therapist)<br/>on referral from, or under the direction, of a health care provider; or</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single visit to a health care provider that results in a regimen of continuing<br/>treatment under the supervision of the health care provider (e.g., medication<br/>therapy).</p>
<p>Intermittent leave or reduced work schedule leaves may be allowed when the<br/>absence required is not due to a condition that is incapacitating at that point in<br/>time (e.g., appointments for cancer treatments, physical therapy, prenatal care).<br/>When leave is taken because of the birth or the placement of a child for adoption<br/>or foster care, intermittent leave or reduced workload schedule will not be<br/>approved if the intermittent leave or reduced workload schedule will adversely<br/>impact the office or department of the employee.</p>
<p>If an employee requests intermittent leave or reduced workload leave to care for<br/>a spouse, child, or parent or for the employee's own serious health condition, the<br/>employee may be required to temporarily transfer to an available alternative<br/>position for which the employee is qualified and that:</p>
<p>a. has equivalent pay and benefits; and</p>
<p>b. better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the regular position of<br/>the employee.</p>
<p>Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not<br/>&quot;serious health conditions,&quot; unless inpatient hospital care is required.</p>
<p>Absence because of an employee's substance abuse, without treatment, does not<br/>qualify for FMLA leave.</p>
<p>18.1404 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAID/UNPAID LEAVE: Leave provided by FMLA in excess of available<br/>accrued paid leave shall be unpaid. Any available paid accrued leave shall be<br/>used prior to unpaid leave (e g., vacation, comp time or sick leave) for the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>18.1405 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEALTH AND DENTAL INSURANCE BENEFITS: Health care and dental<br/>benefits coverage shall be continued during the 12 weeks FMLA leave period<br/>under the same terms and conditions as applicable to all other employees. Upon<br/>expiration of FMLA leave entitlement, if additional unpaid leave is authorized,<br/>continuation of health care and dental benefits coverage shall be allowed with the<br/>employee paying all costs of coverage or as may be allowed in other applicable<br/>policies.</p>
<p>18.1406 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAILURE TO RETURN FROM FMLA LEAVE: If an employee indicates<br/>his/her intent not to return from leave (including at the start of the leave), or if the<br/>employee fails to return from leave, paid health and dental coverage will cease<br/>unless the employee does not return because of the continuation, recurrence, or<br/>onset of a serious health condition which would entitle the employee to FMLA<br/>leave, or other circumstances beyond the employee's control, (such as where an<br/>employee's spouse is unexpectedly transferred to a new job location, someone<br/>other than an immediate family member has a serious health condition which the<br/>employee needs to care for, or the employee is laid off while on leave. The<br/>employee's desire to stay with a family member even though the family member<br/>no longer requires the employee's care, or a mother's decision to stay home with a<br/>newborn child and not return to work, do not qualify as &quot;other circumstances<br/>beyond the employee's control.&quot;</p>
<p>Except as provided above, if an employee fails to return after expiration for<br/>eligibility for FMLA leave, the employee shall pay the full cost of coverage for<br/>health and dental benefits during the entire period of unpaid FMLA leave. Any<br/>amounts due under this section may be deducted from any sums due the<br/>employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation pay, etc.). Failure to reimburse the<br/>District for the cost of coverage during the period of the unpaid leave shall result<br/>in termination of coverage.</p>
<p>If an employee is unable to return to work because of the continuation,<br/>recurrence or onset of a serious health condition, the employee shall provide<br/>medical certification of such claim. The certification shall be issued by the health<br/>care provider of the employee or by health care provider of the employee's child,<br/>spouse or parent if the employee is unable to return to work because of the need<br/>to take care of one of these individuals. The certification shall indicate that the<br/>employee is prevented from performing the functions of the position or is needed<br/>to care for the family member on the date the leave expired. If a requested<br/>certification is not provided within 30 days, the cost of coverage provided during<br/>the period of unpaid FMLA leave shall be due and payable.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>18.1407</p>
<p>EMPLOYEE STATUS WHILE ON LEAVE: FMLA leave does not constitute a<br/>break in service for purposes of longevity and/or seniority.</p>
<p>Seniority shall not be earned for any period of time on unpaid leave. Employees<br/>returning from leave shall return with no less seniority for purposes of layoff,<br/>recall, vacation accrual or other seniority.</p>
<p>18.1408 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEDICAL CERTIFICATION/RECERTIFICATION: Medical certification from<br/>the health care provider of the individual requiring care shall be provided initially<br/>upon request for FMLA leave. The certification shall indicate the estimated<br/>duration of the need for leave. Periodic updates or recertification may be required<br/>upon expiration of the period of leave originally estimated or every 30 days, if<br/>requested by the Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>The employer may, at its own expense, require the eligible employee obtain the<br/>opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by the employer.<br/>When the second opinion differs from the first, the employer may require, at its<br/>own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider<br/>designated and approved jointly by the employer and employee. The opinion of<br/>the third health care provider shall be considered final and binding on the<br/>employer and employee.</p>
<p>If leave is foreseeable, medical certification must be provided within fifteen days<br/>(15) after receipt of the employee's request for leave. If the employee fails to<br/>provide certification, the leave may be denied until certification is provided. If<br/>the leave is not foreseeable, the certification shall be provided within fifteen days<br/>(15), or as soon as is practicable under the circumstances. Failure to provide<br/>certification within a reasonable time under the pertinent circumstances may<br/>result in denial of continuation of the leave.</p>
<p>18.1409 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIRED: If the event necessitating the leave becomes<br/>known to the employee more than 30 calendar days prior to the need for a leave,<br/>the employee shall provide notice as soon as he/she leams of the need for a leave<br/>— at a minimum, 30 days written, advance notice.</p>
<p>If the event necessitating the leave becomes known to the employee less than 30<br/>calendar days prior to the employee's need for a leave, the employee shall<br/>provide as much advance notice as possible, and, at a minimum, written notice no<br/>more than five working days from learning of the need for the leave.</p>
<p>If the need for a family care leave is foreseeable due to a planned medical<br/>treatment or planned supervision of a child, parent or spouse with a serious health<br/>condition, the employee shall provide reasonable advance notice of the need for<br/>the leave and consult with the supervisor regarding the scheduling of the<br/>treatment or supervision so as to minimize disruptions to the school/department.<br/>Any such scheduling shall be subject to the approval of the health care provider<br/>of the family member.</p>
<p>Prior to granting a leave under this policy, medical certification as identified<br/>above, may be required.</p>
<p>18.1410 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REINSTATEMENT UPON RETURN FROM LEAVE: Upon return from FMLA<br/>leave, an employee shall be restored to the position held when the leave</p>

<p>If FMLA leave was due to the employee's own serious health condition, prior to<br/>returning to work, the employee shall provide a certification from the health care<br/>provider that the employee is able to resume the essential duties of the position.</p>
<p>REMEDIES FOR EMPLOYER VIOLATION OF THE ACT: If an employee's<br/>rights under the FMLA have been violated, the employee may file a complaint<br/>with the Secretary of Labor, the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, or<br/>file a private lawsuit within two years after the last action which the employee<br/>contends was in violation of the Act, or three years if the violation was willful.</p></td></tr>

<p>18.1802 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall continue from year to year unless<br/>otherwise terminated in accordance with 18.18.17.</p>
<p>18.1803 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank without<br/>regard to the daily rate of pay of the Catastrophic Leave Bank Participant.</p>
<p>18.1804 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EGEA Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by the District in<br/>accordance with the following criteria.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Catastrophic illness&quot; or &quot;Injury&quot; means an illness or injury that is expected to</p>
<p>incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, or that<br/>incapacitates a member of the employee's family which incapacity requires<br/>the employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time to<br/>care for that family member, and taking extended time off work creates a<br/>financial hardship for the employee because he or she has exhausted all of his<br/>or her sick leave and other paid time off.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Eligible leave credits&quot; means vacation leave and sick leave accrued to the</p>
<p>donating employee.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible leave credits may be donated to an employee for a catastrophic<br/>illness or injury if all of the following requirements are met:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who is, or whose family member is, suffering from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury requests that eligible leave credits be<br/>donated and provides verification of catastrophic injury or illness as<br/>required by the District.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District determines that the employee is unable to work due to the<br/>employee's or his or her family member's catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>The employee has exhausted all accrued paid leave credits.</p>

<p>18.1810</p>
<p>18.1811</p>
<p>18.1812</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the transfer of eligible leave credits is approved by the District, any<br/>employee may, upon written notice to the district, donate eligible leave<br/>credits at a minimum of eight hours, and in hour increments thereafter.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of time that donated leave credits may be used<br/>for, but not to exceed use for a maximum period of 12 consecutive<br/>months.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The verification of catastrophic injury or illness required pursuant to<br/>paragraph (d) of subdivision 18.17.04.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making all transfers of eligible leave credit irrevocable.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who receives paid leave pursuant to this section shall use any<br/>leave credits that he or she continues to accrue on a monthly basis prior to<br/>receiving paid leave pursuant to this section.</p>
<p>All unit members on active duty with the District are eligible to contribute to the<br/>EGEA Catastrophic Bank if they have accrued a minimum of ten days sick leave.</p>
<p>Participating is voluntary, but requires contribution to the Bank. Only<br/>contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first<br/>becoming eligible must wait until the next designated open enrollment period of<br/>the Sick Leave Bank. Open enrollment period will be between July 1 and<br/>October 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>The contribution, on the appropriate form, will be authorized by the Unit<br/>Member and continued from year to year until canceled by the Unit Member.</p>
<p>Cancellation occurs automatically whenever a Unit Member fails to make his/her<br/>annual contribution or assessment. Cancellation, on the proper form, may be<br/>effected at any time and the Unit Member shall not be eligible to draw from the<br/>Bank as of the effective date of cancellation. Sick leave previously authorized for<br/>contribution to the Bank shall not be returned if the Unit Member effects<br/>cancellation.</p>
<p>Contribution shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each school year.<br/>Unit Members returning from extended leave which included the enrollment<br/>period and new hires will be permitted to contribute within thirty (30) calendar<br/>days of beginning work. The District shall supply enrollment forms for the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank to all new Unit Members and those Unit Members<br/>returning from leave.</p>
<p>The annual rate of contribution by each participating Unit Member for each<br/>school year shall be one (1) day of sick leave which shall be deemed to equate to<br/>the legal minimum required by Education Code 44043 .5.</p>
<p>An additional day of contribution will be required of participants if the number of<br/>days in Bank falls below 1000. The bargaining unit will request voluntary<br/>contributions. If no voluntary contributions are forthcoming assessment may be<br/>necessary. Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are drawing from the Bank</p>
<p>at the time of the assessment will not be required to contribute to remain eligible<br/>to draw from the Bank.</p>
<p>18.1813 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days in the Bank at the beginning of a school year exceeds 2000,<br/>no contribution shall be required of returning Unit Members. Those Unit<br/>Members joining the Catastrophic Leave Bank, for the first time and those<br/>returning from leave, shall be required to contribute one (1) day to the Bank.</p>
<p>18.1814 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members who are retiring or leaving the employ of the District may<br/>contribute their unused sick leave to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>18.1815 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the exhaustion of sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>18.1816 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a<br/>withdrawal request, the District is under no obligation to provide days and is<br/>under no obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If the District<br/>denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension of withdrawal, because of<br/>insufficient days to fund the request, they shall notify the participant, in writing,<br/>of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>18.1817 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining<br/>in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be returned to the current members of the<br/>Bank proportionately. <sup>62</sup></p>

<p>Compensation</p>
<p>19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation</p>
<p>19.101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salary Schedule shall be in Appendix B.</p>

<p>The lottery bonuses will be a percentage bonus off the salary schedule to be<br/>established on monies available to the Elk Grove Education Association unit.<br/>Each unit member will receive a percentage bonus based on their placement on<br/>the negotiated salary schedule. It is further understood that unit members under<br/>contract for less than 45 days will not be entitled to a lottery bonus. Unit<br/>members working in excess of 45 days but less than the 184 contracted days<br/>(traditional/modified traditional) and 175 (year-round) will receive a<br/>proportionate lottery bonus based on their salary schedule placement. This<br/>understanding excludes all additional responsibilities, i.e., extended year, adjunct<br/>duties, hourly pay, Mentor Teacher stipend, etc.</p>
<p>19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>

Teachers who earn their teaching credential prior to/or simultaneously<br/>with their Bachelor’s Degree will get salary credit for the units earned toward the<br/>credential—retroactive to July 1, 2001.</p>
<p>19.205 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funded COLA is the amount which the District actually receives in increased<br/>revenue limit per ADA. It is not intended to include funds already received by<br/>the District in some other category.</p>
<p>19.3</p>
<p>Annual Rate of Pay</p>
<p>19.301 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of pay for all unit members shall be as established in Appendix B.</p>
<p>19.302 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Library-Media Teachers shall be placed on the salary schedule and extended for<br/>ten (10) days to be used as directed by the site level administrator.</p>
<p>Compensation for the ten (10) days shall be based on per diem.</p>

<p>19.401 Unit members shall be paid per diem for work done at the direction of the district<br/>(1) prior to the first day of work year, (2) after the last day of work year, (3)<br/>during any vacation period designated on the school calendar. Excluded from the<br/>above is pre-work year induction meetings and conferences required of unit<br/>members new to the district.</p>
<p>19.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hourly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay</p>
<p>19.501 Unit members teaching summer school working in curriculum assessment and<br/>development, and home teaching will be paid according to the schedule in<br/>Appendix C.</p>
<p>19.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancement</p>
<p>19.601 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of a degree shall be verified in writing to the Human Resources<br/>Department by an accredited institution.</p>
<p>19.602 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All units for advancement require submission of official transcripts of course<br/>verification to the Human Resources Department no later than October 1 of the<br/>contract year in which the change is made.</p>
<p>19.603 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All college/university units shall be from an accredited institution.</p>
<p>19.604 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior approval from the site level administrator shall be obtained for all units<br/>which apply to advancement.</p>
<p>19.605 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than twelve (12) semester units during one school year may be taken<br/>without written approval of the site level administrator.</p>
<p>19.606 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College/university units and in-service units shall be treated equally but shall not<br/>be duplicated for advancement. One (1) semester unit will be credited for each<br/>fifteen (15) hours of in-service participation.</p>
<p>19.607 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semester units for travel, approved by the site level administrator, will be<br/>credited at six (6) semester units for one (1) year, three (3) semester units for<br/>one-half year, two (2) semester units for a minimum of six (6) weeks and one (1)<br/>semester unit for less than six (6) weeks.</p>
<p>19.608 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-service units shall be granted only for participation that occurs outside the unit<br/>member's established day.</p>
<p>19.609 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units and hours taken must be pre-approved by Curriculum Professional<br/>Learning according to current District priorities and further the instructional<br/>goals of the District.</p>
<p>Entering teachers may not be placed on Column G until and unless they have<br/>earned that placement after employment in the District.</p>
<p>19.610 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District criteria for earning salary credit shall be reviewed annually by the<br/>Professional Learning Advisory Committee. This new District criteria shall be<br/>effective for courses completed on or after July 1, 2009 and shall not be applied<br/>retroactively.</p>
<p>19.611 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H Step shall be 4.33% more than G Step effective July 1, 2006.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H Step will require 75 hours to complete.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H Step will be renewable; i.e. hours accumulated for H Step must be renewed<br/>every 10 years. EGEA and the District are aware of Education Code 45028’s<br/>requirement for a salary schedule based upon uniform allowance for years of<br/>training and years of experience. It is the intent of the parties to modify that<br/>requirement for the purposes of H Step. However, each teacher will be<br/>uniformly treated in regard to H Step’s applicability and H Step hours. The<br/>specific purpose for the requirement to renew the training hours is continuing<br/>commitment to achieving District goals after a unit member has arrived at the<br/>top of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>Hours approved and earned prior to June 30, 2010 can be utilized and applied<br/>to future H step renewals.</p>
<p>(For example, due to the 2010-2011 column freeze, H step bargaining unit<br/>members shall retain their H step placement regardless of the years and hours<br/>requirement in place during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012.)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to receive H Step credit for district-sponsored or non-district<br/>sponsored courses, the course must be pre-approved.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only staff on Steps G or H may accumulate H Step hours.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The H Step course list will be revised annually as new subject areas are<br/>added and old areas dropped.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may take courses outside of District offerings in the<br/>designated subject areas provided that they complete an evaluation of the<br/>course designed subject areas provided that they complete an evaluation of<br/>the course designed to determine the usefulness of the course for future<br/>credit.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as for Steps B-G, the prior approval process will be followed for courses<br/>taken outside of the District.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H Step credit may be earned in areas not on the list on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>19.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules</p>
<p>19.701 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) experience step will be granted for each school year in which at least<br/>75% of the work year is completed.</p>
<p>19.702 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those unit members working less than a full contract (100%) for less than 75%<br/>of the work days in a year, will be entitled to an experience step when the total of<br/>their assignment (accumulated over the necessary years) equals 100%. For<br/>example, when unit members teach 40%, they will be entitled to an experience<br/>credit of one year at the beginning of the fourth year of their employment. If<br/>there is credit accumulated beyond 100%, it will be banked.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience credit on the salary schedule for those working fewer than<br/>seventy-five percent (75%) of the days of a year will occur the July 1<br/>following when the person accumulates more than seventy-five percent of a<br/>complete assignment.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 2 years experience credit is awarded, the employee starts the process<br/>in 1 above over again from the beginning.</p>
<p>19.703 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no case shall more than one (1) experience step be credited in a school year.<br/>Unit members on educational or military leave shall be credited one (1) step for<br/>each year of leave, upon return to the district.</p>
<p>19.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience Placement—Entry</p>
<p>19.801 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New employees that have no teaching or vocational experience will be assigned<br/>to the appropriate class at Step 1.</p>
<p>19.802 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New employees with teaching and/or vocational experience will be placed based<br/>on years of acceptable experience up to Step 11.</p>
<p>19.803 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for prior experience will be determined by the Human Resources<br/>Department guided by the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior teaching experience shall have required a teaching credential.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;year is defined as 75% of the contract or calendar or requested year.<br/>Fractional parts of one (1) year may not be combined to meet the percentage<br/>requirements.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior teaching and/or vocational experience (including experience in the<br/>district) shall have occurred within fifteen (15) years immediately preceding<br/>the date of employment with the district. <sup>66</sup></p>
<p>66</p>
<p>d. Placement on the schedule shall be based upon receipt and approval of<br/>verification of records and documents by the Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>19.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stipend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules</p>
<p>19.901 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special assignment stipend in the amount of $500 shall be awarded to teachers of<br/>Educable Mentally Retarded and Trainable Mentally Retarded pupils.</p>
<p>19.902 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BILINGUAL STIPEND: The intent is to recognize teachers who have obtained<br/>the Language Development Certificate or the Bilingual Credential by paying<br/>them a stipend based on Class I or Class II of the Adjunct Duty Schedule. The<br/>stipend would be applicable only to classrooms designated as bilingual or ESL.</p>
<p>Class I Stipend for Language Development Certificate $680 - 783</p>
<p>Class II Stipend for Bilingual Credential $1088 - 1248</p>
<p>19.903 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctoral bonus shall be based on 7% of the beginning step (Al) and awarded<br/>with the verification of the degree.</p>
<p>19.10 Pay Warrants</p>
<p>19.1001 Unit members paid by the month shall receive their warrants on the last working<br/>day of the month unless circumstances beyond the district's control delay the<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>19.11 Travel Expenses</p>
<p>19.1101 It is agreed that the district will reimburse employees' transportation costs</p>
<p>incurred as a consequence of their assigned tasks. Reimbursement for approved<br/>job-related travel will be at the per mile rate established by IRS. Home to work<br/>site travel is not reimbursable. Fixed travel allowances for those employees<br/>whose job related travel is extensive shall be approved by the Business Office.<br/>Such allowance shall be reviewed annually and adjusted when necessary. <sup>67</sup></p>

<p>19.1202</p>
<p>19.1203</p>
<p>19.1204</p>
<p>Salary and Payment. Unit members employed in federal programs which do not<br/>correspond with the teaching year will be paid a salary equivalent to the salary<br/>they would receive if they were a regular teacher in the district with the salary<br/>being computed on a per diem basis for the period in which the project is<br/>financed by the federal government. This per diem rate will be determined by<br/>dividing the salary schedule placement by the number of days in the current<br/>contract year but the salary will be paid in equal amounts for the monthly periods<br/>included in the project.</p>
<p>Sick Leave. Sick leave will be allocated to unit members employed in federal<br/>projects in the same manner as other unit members.</p>
<p>Transfer from regular assignment to a federal project. Any unit member's<br/>voluntary or involuntary transfer from a regular certificated position to a federal<br/>project will be paid out for the school year at the contract rate. Sick leave and<br/>other district-sponsored benefit programs will not be affected by the transfer.</p>
<p>Additional responsibilities. In the event the unit member is assigned additional<br/>responsibilities, such as supervision, then this shall be added to his/her contract<br/>whether he/she is transferred from the regular staff of the district to a federal<br/>project or employed from outside of the district. <sup>68</sup></p>

<p>ARTICLE 20</p>
<p>Additional Compensation</p>
<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria</p>
<p>20.101 The District will pay compensation over and above contract salaries for</p>
<p>certificated teaching employees who accept substantial and continuing extra<br/>responsibilities. The Superintendent will implement regulations which provide<br/>for the distribution of such compensation in an equitable manner. The schedule<br/>will provide for categories of payment in terms of six criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program responsibilities</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of students supervised in activity</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of staff supervised in activity</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Degree of administrative or community expectation and pressure</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental factors such as danger, personal liability</p>
<p>20.2 Compensation</p>
<p>20.201 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rates of pay for additional responsibilities shall be as established on the<br/>schedules in Appendix C.</p>
<p>20.202 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All compensation for additional responsibilities beyond regular teaching<br/>assignment will be based on the adjunct duties salary schedule.</p>
<p>20.203 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee's placement for experience on the adjunct duties salary schedule shall<br/>be determined by the years of experience in the extra responsibility assignment.<br/>One (1) year of experience will equal one (1) step.</p>
<p>20.204 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of steps an employee can advance in this classification is<br/>five (5).</p>
<p>20.205 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary compensation shall be awarded for assignments such as department<br/>chairpersons, athletic coaches, and designated responsibilities.</p>
<p>20.3</p>

<p>21.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage</p>
<p>21.801 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district will provide for the health and insurance plans noted below and make</p>
<p>contributions to those plans as noted:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight Term Life Insurance</p>
<p>21.802 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the current plan year, summaries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the plan documents and current employer</p>
<p>and employee premium cost schedules that are in Appendix G.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s maximum contribution toward medical benefit premium costs<br/>shall be 80% of the premium cost for the low cost medical plan offered by<br/>the District. Each Bargaining Unit Member’s contribution toward medical<br/>benefit premium costs shall be 20% of the premium cost for the low cost plan<br/>medical plan offered by the District. Unit members shall be responsible for<br/>the buy up costs related to selecting a medical plan other than the low cost<br/>plan.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellness Rebate Compensation</p>
<p>Each unit member who submits to the District an approved Wellness<br/>certification that verifies that the unit member has satisfied all of the<br/>Wellness requirements referenced in section 1(c) below, each year shall<br/>receive a Wellness Rebate equal to five percent (5%) of the total premium<br/>cost of the Low Cost plan based upon the subscriber level selected for the<br/>year. The value of the five percent (5%) Wellness Rebate Compensation will<br/>change each year depending upon the total premium cost of the low cost<br/>medical plan provided by the District. <sup>74</sup></p>
<p>74</p>
<p>The Wellness requirements must be completed by May 15<sup>th</sup> in order to<br/>receive the rebate on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellness Rebate Compensation Requirements</p>
<p>In conjunction with Kaiser and Western Health Advantage, EGEA and the<br/>District will develop a list of the annual physical examination and Wellness<br/>assessment requirements necessary to receive the annual Wellness Rebate<br/>compensation. The physical examination and wellness assessments may<br/>include an annual physical examination, completion of an online Health Risk<br/>Assessment, a Comprehensive Metabolic Plan (CMP), a body mass index<br/>(BMI) test and/or other age appropriate screenings.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those unit members who can provide proof of alternative medical coverage<br/>may waive out of medical benefits. Those so electing will receive through<br/>the IRC 125 a cash option payment. The amount paid to those waiving<br/>health benefits shall be $780 yearly.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will create a fund for medical reimbursement of the copays for<br/>retired employees electing the lowest cost plan funded with $240 per eligible<br/>retiree. Retirees may be reimbursed for copays up to $240 annually. After<br/>all copay expenses have been received, a retiree will be paid up to $240 for<br/>incurred expenses. That amount left over from retirees not using the entire<br/>$240 will be used to pay the claims of those which exceed $240 on a prorated<br/>basis. The retiree copay reimbursement dollars are increased to match the<br/>increased copay amounts.</p>
<p>21.803 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will make a contribution to their current health care benefit package<br/>of $50.00 on a twelve month basis starting July 1, 2010. The $50.00 contribution<br/>will increase by an additional $10.00 per month July 1st of each succeeding year<br/>until the individual unit member’s contribution rate for the cost of current health<br/>benefits of $90.00 per month is achieved.</p>
<p>21.804 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and EGEA agree to join the other bargaining units in the creation of<br/>the Elk Grove Benefits Employee Retirement Trust (EGBERT). The intent of all<br/>the bargaining units is to preserve health care benefits at retirement. The<br/>EGBERT will assume the responsibility for the payment of retiree health benefits<br/>for those retiring effective July 1, 2000. During the interim time frame, the<br/>District will assume the responsibility for the payment of retiree health benefits<br/>for those retiring prior to July 1, 2000, will continue the payments for existing<br/>retirees as set out in current agreements, and will make the agreed upon<br/>contribution to the trust ($80.00 twelfthly for each benefit qualified unit<br/>member).</p>
<p>21.805 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended that the EGBERT board will be made up of one representative from<br/>AFSCME, one from ATU, one from EGUSD MGT, one from EGEA, one from<br/>PSWA, and two from current retirees (one certificated and one classified). It will<br/>be the continuing responsibility of the EGBERT to determine benefits and<br/>recommend contribution levels. The EGBERT and the Elk Grove Exclusive<br/>Representatives agree to use a combined negotiating team drawn from all of the<br/>participating District exclusive representatives to negotiate those contributions<br/>with the District. [The retirement health benefits trust component of the proposal <sup>75</sup></p>
<p>75</p>
<p>is contingent upon the District reaching agreements with the other four<br/>bargaining units with identical terms.]</p>
<p>21.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rich history of co-operative problem solving, the District and the Association</p>
<p>agree to pursue methods for controlling future healthcare costs with the understanding that<br/>failure to do so may impact future salary increases.</p>
<p>21.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will alert employees to health care options that don’t include double coverage,<br/>the right to change benefit programs if a spouse has an open enrollment period, and other<br/>options to assist employees in making informed decisions.</p>
<p>21.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will implement a system of auditing eligibility for benefits to assure all those<br/>receiving benefits are entitled to do so.</p>
<p>21.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EGEA will not be limited to j oint bargaining with other units regarding Health and Welfare<br/>Benefits. EGEA agrees to continue to negotiate with the District regarding Health and<br/>Welfare Benefits. EGEA agrees to meet with EGUSD once a month to discuss Health and<br/>Welfare Benefits for the duration of this agreement. <sup>76</sup></p>

The Participating Teacher may request to meet with the PAR<br/>Panel to discuss the assignment of the Consulting Teacher within two weeks<br/>of notification.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties intend that all documentation and information related to<br/>participation in the PAR program be regarded as a personnel matter subject</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>to the personnel record exemption of the Public Records Act contained<br/>within Government Code 6250 et seq.</p>

<p>22.703 Participating Teacher</p>
<p>a. A Participating Teacher is a unit member who receives an unsatisfactory<br/>rating and who is to receive assistance and coaching to improve instructional<br/>skills, classroom management, knowledge of instructional subject matter, and<br/>related aspects of teaching performance. There are two (2) categories of<br/>Participating Teachers—those who volunteer and those who are required to<br/>participate based upon having received a “Continuation with Improvement(s)<br/>Required.”</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of participation in the PAR program is to help correct job-<br/>related deficiencies and to assist the unit member in improving<br/>performance. Permanent unit members who have received a<br/>“Continuation with Improvement(s) Required” are candidates for<br/>participation in PAR.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher assigned by the PAR Panel will provide<br/>assistance to the Participating Teacher until he/she concludes that further<br/>assistance will not be beneficial, at which time the Consulting Teacher<br/>will submit a final report of the teacher’s participation in the program to<br/>the PAR Panel. The Participating Teacher may submit a written<br/>response to the final report and/or request a meeting with the PAR Panel<br/>subject to the rules established by the panel. A copy of the Consulting<br/>Teacher’s final report shall be provided to both the Participating Teacher<br/>and the Evaluator prior to its submission to the PAR Panel. The<br/>Evaluator will be provided the opportunity to address the PAR Panel<br/>upon request. The Evaluator’s comments shall be advisory only. <sup>80</sup></p>
<p>80</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel will forward a final evaluation of the teacher’s<br/>participation in the program to the Governing Board, Superintendent, or<br/>designee. The evaluation and recommendation(s) of the PAR Panel and<br/>the peer review reports prepared by the Consulting Teachers shall be<br/>advisory only, for the benefit of the Participating Teacher and the District<br/>and shall in no way limit the District’s discretion or authority with regard<br/>to decisions and actions regarding the employment status of any<br/>employee. The fact that the employee is participating in PAR will not<br/>limit or delay the District’s authority or discretion to make any such<br/>decision or take any such action. Participation in PAR will not create<br/>any right or expectancy of continued employment by the District for any<br/>period of time.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the Participating Teacher’s participation in PAR may be<br/>used in the evaluation of the teacher pursuant to Education Code § 44660<br/>et seq.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation is not provided to Participating Teachers for participation<br/>in PAR, except that authorized in participation in activities such as<br/>workshops, seminars, beyond the regular work day. Authorized<br/>participation in PAR may be used for credits toward step advancement.</p>
<p>b. A Volunteer Teacher Participant is a permanent status unit member who<br/>seeks to improve his/her teacher performance. The Volunteer Teacher<br/>Participant may request the PAR Panel to assign a Consulting Teacher to<br/>provide peer assistance. The Consulting Teacher will play no role in the<br/>evaluation of the teaching performance of the Volunteer Teacher Participant.<br/>The Volunteer Teacher Participant, in his/her discretion, may terminate<br/>his/her participation in PAR at any time.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers will be trained to both offer peer assistance and to<br/>understand the specific functions of the PAR Program. The panel will<br/>monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Consulting Teacher and will<br/>make decisions regarding their continuation in the program. The PAR Panel<br/>may remove a Consulting Teacher from the position at any time because of<br/>the specific needs of the PAR Program, inadequate performance of the<br/>Consulting Teacher, or reasons determined by the panel in its discretion to<br/>justify removal. Prior to the effective date of such removal, the PAR Panel<br/>will provide the Consulting Teacher with a written statement of the reasons<br/>for the removal, and, at the request of the Consulting Teacher, will meet<br/>with him/her to discuss the reasons.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditures for the PAR program shall not exceed revenues received from<br/>funds made available without the mutual agreement of the parties.</p>

If there are BTSA support providers who are released or more<br/>Consulting Teachers needed, then the process of selection set out in these<br/>procedures shall be followed.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the regular salary, a Consulting Teacher will receive a stipend.<br/>The PAR Panel will determine appropriate stipend rates based upon release<br/>time and caseload.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers shall have a caseload determined by a ratio of<br/>Consulting Teachers to Participating Teachers. This ratio is dependent on<br/>the amount of intervention time needed, as determined by the PAR Panel,<br/>and shall also consider BTSA and other beginning teacher assistance<br/>programs.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR program encourages a cooperative relationship between the<br/>Consulting Teacher, Participating Teacher, and the Evaluator with respect to<br/>the process of peer assistance and review. The Participating Teacher and<br/>the Consulting Teacher will meet with the Evaluator to review and discuss<br/>the basis for referral to the PAR program. The Participating Teacher<br/>assistance plan shall be based upon the areas in which the Participating<br/>Teacher’s evaluation reflects unsatisfactory performance. The Consulting<br/>Teacher is encouraged to confer regularly with the Evaluator regarding the<br/>implementation of the PAR program with respect to each Participating<br/>Teacher.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the Participating Teacher or the Consulting Teacher, the<br/>PAR Panel may assign a different Consulting Teacher to work with the<br/>Participating Teacher at any time during the year.</p>
<p>22.705 General Provisions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers and those teachers serving on the PAR Panel shall not<br/>be considered management or supervisory based upon their participation in<br/>PAR. Teachers who provide assistance and review shall have the same<br/>protection from liability and access to appropriate defense as other public<br/>school employees pursuant to Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810)<br/>of Title 1 of the Government Code. The District shall hold these teachers<br/>and administrators harmless for actions occurring within the scope of their<br/>responsibility for participation in PAR. The decisions of the consulting<br/>teacher and the PAR Panel which might lead to a decision by the Board of<br/>Education to bring dismissal actions are discretionary not ministerial and are<br/>not grievable.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that recently retired exemplary teachers may be invited to serve<br/>as Consulting Teachers per procedures developed by the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>22.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training</p>
<p>A teacher may be required by the principal to participate in in-service training or course work<br/>at college or university level when, in the judgment of the principal, such training or</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>education will assist the teacher to be more effective in his/her classroom or adjunct<br/>responsibilities. In-service or college units earned may be used as part of the requirements for<br/>training class advancement on the salary schedule. This requirement may not exceed the<br/>equivalent of three semester units in any three-year period.</p>
<p>22.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher-Administrator-Governing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relationships</p>
<p>22.901 Recognizing that providing a high quality education for children is the paramount<br/>aim of this school system, and good morale in the teaching staff is necessary for<br/>the best education of the children, the Governing Board encourages the<br/>participation of staff members in the activities of their professional organizations<br/>and encourages the organizations to exercise their rights and responsibilities<br/>within the spirit and letter of the law. The Governing Board also recognizes the<br/>following roles and responsibilities that are clearly established by law:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governing Board, under law, has the final responsibility of establishing<br/>policies for the school system, subject to the requirements of negotiation as<br/>provided for by California law.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent and his/her staff have a responsibility of carrying out the<br/>policies established.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated teaching personnel have the ultimate responsibility of<br/>providing the best possible education in the classroom.</p>
<p>22.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attainment of Goals</p>
<p>22.1001 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attainment of the goals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the educational program conducted in the schools of</p>
<p>the district requires mutual understanding and cooperation among the Governing<br/>Board, the Superintendent and his/her administrative staff, the certificated<br/>personnel, the classified personnel and other citizens of the community. To this<br/>end, free and open exchange of views is desirable, proper, and necessary.</p>
<p>22.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope of Negotiations</p>
<p>The Governing Board will strictly construe the scope of bargaining as provided in 3543.2 of<br/>the Government Code (SB 160).</p>
<p>22.12 Consultation</p>
<p>22.1201 The Governing Board will also freely consult with exclusive representatives<br/>within the rights granted to them by law (Government Code 3543.2).</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of educational objectives.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination of content of courses and curriculum.</p>
<p>c. Selection of textbooks.</p>
<p>22.1202 The Governing Board reserves to itself its unlimited right to consult with any</p>
<p>employee groups on any matter outside the scope of representation. Consultation<br/>procedures and processes are not a negotiable items. However, the Governing<br/>Board views healthy consultation between and among Governing Board,<br/>administration, and employee groups as highly desirable.</p>
<p>22.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandated Physicals</p>
<p>The District will pay the reasonable cost of mandated physicals.</p>
<p>22.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Contracts</p>
<p>22.1401 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary criteria for approving shared contracts shall be successfully meeting<br/>the educational needs of students and will ensure the other provisions of BP</p>

<p>Full Inclusion Teachers</p>
<p>In an attempt to mitigate the additional time required for teachers who work with fully<br/>included students (those students identified as severely handicapped who are assigned to<br/>general education classrooms for their primary placement), the District agrees to allocate<br/>$500 per student per year.</p>
<p>22.15 01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher of a fully included student shall have discretion in spending the</p>
<p>$500 allocation in electing from a menu of options including release time,<br/>training, materials (regular education if so indicated by the teacher), and<br/>exchange duties.</p>
<p>22.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education (SPED)</p>
<p>Staffing and working conditions in Special Education (SPED) need modification to assist<br/>teachers in meeting the needs of special education students. The District has determined to<br/>advance the projected growth in SPED enrollments so that class sizes in the beginning of the<br/>year allow for growth without exceeding reasonable limits. The District intends to monitor<br/>SPED class sizes on a quarterly basis and to increase services to students which could include<br/>additional teachers, instructional assistants, revised IEP’s for alternative services to students<br/>or other necessary support. Additionally, SPED teachers will be allowed access to the<br/>transfer process on the same basis as all other teachers, including but not limited to access to<br/>growth and vacant positions on the Winter and Spring postings.</p>
<p>22.1601 The District will also monitor learning center numbers and staffing to determine<br/>which, if any, need intervention. In effect the above intervention is designed to<br/>make the District more sensitive to the needs of SPED teachers and to assure that<br/>SPED teachers are treated equitably in comparison with regular education<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>22.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Services—Nurses</p>
<p>22.1701 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staffing and working conditions for nurses are in need of review. Nurses will be<br/>convened to review and prioritize job description functions to assure that highest<br/>priority assignments are accomplished.</p>
<p>22.1702 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District intends to regionalize nursing services and increase nursing staffing<br/>by two nurses.</p>
<p>22.1703 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance their efficiency, individual nurses will be provided technological<br/>support (laptop computers).</p>
<p>22.1704 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare reimbursements for services provided by nurses will be used to<br/>improve the level of healthcare services in the District.</p>
<p>22.18</p>
<p>Technology</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that consistent focus and careful planning need to<br/>accompany their mutual commitment to technology.</p>
<p>22.1801 The District will work to create an expenditure model which assures that funds<br/>are systematically spent to meet the technology needs.</p>

<p>Article 2 - Recognition; Article 3 - Negotiation Procedures; Article 4 - Association/Unit<br/>Member Rights; Article 5 - District Rights; Article 6 - Dues and Payroll Deductions (except<br/>all unit members are required to either belong to the Association or pay a service fee unless<br/>exempted pursuant to the conscience exceptions contained in this article); Article 7 -<br/>Grievance Procedure; Article 12 - Personnel Records; Article 15 - Teacher Safety; Article 16<br/>- Complaints; Article 18 - Leaves (except as noted below); Article 24 - Completion of<br/>Negotiations; Article 25 - Savings; Article 26 - Concerted Activities; Article 27 - Limited<br/>Term Agreements; and Article 28 - Duration.</p>
<p>23 .2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and EGEA have agreed to the provisions of this Article in recognition of the special</p>
<p>conditions involved in the Adult and Continuing Education Division (hereinafter &quot;Adult<br/>Education&quot;). Adult Education is conducted by a combination of full-time and part-time<br/>employees trained in the methods to meet the learning needs of the District's youth and adult<br/>population in the areas of essential skills, life-long learning, and vocational and occupational<br/>training. While it is recognized that Adult Education personnel may be concurrently<br/>employed in other district programs including but not limited to K-12, it is the intention of the<br/>parties that the employment relationship described in this Article, and the rights that flow<br/>therefrom, are separate and distinct from the rights which may accrue to the individual from<br/>other employment in the District. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Article and<br/>the terms of other provisions of the Agreement as they apply to Adult and continuing<br/>education, this article shall prevail.</p>
<p>23.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Recognition</p>
<p>23.301 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All personnel in adult education programs shall be employed under contracts<br/>appended to this agreement. These contracts shall specify the duration of the<br/>employment, and shall terminate on or before June 30 of the year in which they<br/>are issued. If the duration of the contract is to extend beyond June 30, a second<br/>contract shall be issued to cover the balance of the employment period.</p>
<p>23.302 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract term for a person hired to complete the term(s) of employment of<br/>another person shall be for the duration of the original term(s). All contracts of<br/>employment shall be terminable at any time prior to expiration, but only for lack<br/>of funds, elimination or reductions of the educational offering, insufficient<br/>enrollment or attendance, unsatisfactory performance, or any of the causes listed<br/>in Education Code § 44932 et seq.</p>
<p>23.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>

<p>Class size shall not exceed the room occupancy/seating requirements of applicable fire codes.<br/>Classes are subject to cancellation if they fall below fifteen (15).</p>
<p>23.501 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as indicated by tenure laws or as indicated below, adult school unit<br/>members shall be employed on an hourly, as-needed basis. For employees<br/>working and entitled to fewer than 19.2 hours whose class(es) have attendance of<br/>ten (10) or more at the class-size, minimum-evaluation point, the class will be<br/>continued for the duration of the term so long as the attendance does not drop<br/>lower than seven (7).</p>
<p>23.502 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the class is subsequently offered pursuant to the assignment pattern in 23.1502<br/>and taught by the same unit member, the class must have fifteen (15) or more to<br/>be continued for the duration of the term.</p>
<p>23.503 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unit members with 19.2 or more hours whose class has an attendance of 10 or<br/>more at the class-size, minimum-evaluation point, the class will be continued<br/>through its term. If the class does not meet the minimum of ten (10), paragraph</p>
<p>23.504 applies.</p>
<p>23.504 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the class is subsequently offered to the same permanent unit member, the class<br/>must have fifteen or more students to be continued. If not, the unit member will<br/>be assigned within the scope of his or her credential to a position held by the least<br/>senior employee/unit member for the number of class hours canceled. The<br/>displaced employee/unit member shall not have bumping rights.</p>
<p>23.505 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class-size minimums will be reviewed on the fourth meeting of that class when<br/>they meet three (3) or more times per week and on the second class when they<br/>meet two (2) or less times per week. In the event that a class is to be closed at the<br/>above evaluation point(s), the director of the adult and continuing education<br/>program or a designee will personally inform any instructor of the decision to<br/>close the class and the date/time of the final class meeting. A formal written<br/>notification will be given to the instructor.</p>
<p>23.506 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes which do not meet the minimum class size requirements described above<br/>may be continued at the discretion of Adult Education based upon the following<br/>criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is part of a &quot;start-up&quot; or &quot;venture&quot; program.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is part of a high school diploma program for credit.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is fee-based and financially self-supporting.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is legally mandated.</p>

A formal, written notification will be given to the<br/>instructor one week prior to the date/time of the termination of the class.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hourly rate of pay shall be set forth in the Adult Education Appendix.<br/>Advancement in pay due to experience shall be contingent upon the unit<br/>member having provided service (actively working) to the District as an adult<br/>school teacher for not less than twenty-seven (27) weeks during the<br/>preceding year. Verification of Units must be made no later than October 1<br/>of the year in which unit member anticipates movement between columns.<br/>Units taken must be approved in advance by the Staff Development/Human<br/>Resources Department based upon the criterion that the teaching<br/>performance of the unit member will be enhanced either in subject matter or<br/>technique.</p>
<p>23.902 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substitute rate shall be based on the lowest rate of pay on the schedule for all<br/>new substitutes. Any existing member shall be paid their current wage for<br/>substituting.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who wants to substitute will fill out the days and hours of<br/>availability and file the form with AEA for inclusion on the substitute list.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AEA has discretion in appointing subs but will consider teacher input if<br/>appropriate.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time served as a substitute will not count for any purpose, including but not<br/>limited to sick leave, health benefit eligibility, seniority or movement on the<br/>salary schedule.</p>
<p>23.10 Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>23.1001 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide for each unit member who works no less than 20 hours<br/>per week for 36 weeks per year a yearly health and welfare benefit allocation<br/>equivalent. The amount of the health and welfare benefit allocation shall be set<br/>forth in the Adult Education Appendix.</p>
<p>23.1002 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall earn more than one (1) full benefit from any combination<br/>of regular day school employment and adult school employment. Qualification</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>for benefits cannot combine hours worked between regular day school<br/>employment, substituting, and adult school employment in any capacity.</p>
<p>23.1003 All unit members receiving fringe benefits may continue to receive fringe</p>
<p>benefits for that benefit year by contributing the differential percentage that their<br/>assignment is to qualifying time, i.e., if the unit member were assigned twenty<br/>(20) hours and during the benefit year was reduced to sixteen (16) hours, then the<br/>unit member could retain benefits by contributing twenty-five percent (25%) of<br/>the costs. This right is conditioned upon continuing employment with Adult<br/>Education.</p>
<p>23.11 Workday and Work Year</p>
<p>23.1101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workday is to be scheduled as per the Adult Education calendar. The work<br/>year shall be established by the AEA after consultation with the Faculty Advisory<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>23.1102 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher work assignment shall end after the end of the class.</p>
<p>23.1103 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall be compensated for any mandatory, required meetings outside the<br/>assigned work hours.</p>
<p>23.1104 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mileage shall be paid when an employee is required to commute between two<br/>sites without an intervening time in the schedule of two or more hours.</p>
<p>23.1105 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-time teacher work year shall consist of thirty-six (36) weeks at thirty-<br/>two and one-half (32.5) hours (including prep time).</p>
<p>23.1106 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide those unit members currently working more than 36 weeks<br/>the same length work year, they will receive first priority for available<br/>assignments for which they are credentialed and competent.</p>
<p>23.1107 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time staff members shall be paid for one-half hour of preparation per day.<br/>Those staff currently with more preparation time shall be grandpersoned.</p>
<p>23.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduling</p>
<p>The District agrees to make a good faith effort to notify unit members of their assignments at<br/>the earliest possible opportunity. If feasible, the District shall notify teachers of their tentative<br/>teaching schedules fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the start of each semester.</p>
<p>23.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working Conditions</p>
<p>Student aides or other clerical persons shall be available four (4) nights per week for assisting<br/>faculty in clerical duties, copying, etc., provided that sufficient funds are available as<br/>reasonably determined by AEA.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>23.14</p>
<p>Layoff or Reduction of Unit Members for Lack of Funds</p>
<p>23.1401 In the case of current Adult Education funded personnel who are not to be<br/>renewed due to lack of work or lack of funds (when more teachers have<br/>assignment rights than course offerings), the following procedures shall apply:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AEA shall first identify the affected course(s), including closely-related<br/>courses in the same subject (i.e., English 1, 2, 3 and 4).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seniority of all non-tenured personnel teaching the course(s) and<br/>assigned to the time-reporting site shall be reviewed.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority is measured by the number of consecutive, uninterrupted years<br/>of satisfactory service. Time spent on approved unpaid leaves of absence<br/>does not count as time served but does not constitute an interruption of<br/>the &quot;consecutive<sup>1</sup> service requirement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for a year of seniority, the individual must have satisfactorily<br/>served at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the weeks for full-time<br/>service (27 weeks).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service in both Adult Education and continuing education programs<br/>(categorical and general fund) shall apply.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee qualified according to the criteria of 23.1501 (b) with the least<br/>seniority shall be released first unless the site administrator reasonably<br/>determines that the person has needed instructional skills or qualifications,<br/>not possessed by an employee with greater seniority. A seniority list shall be<br/>maintained by the Human Resources Department, provided to impacted<br/>employees and EGEA prior to layoff pursuant to this Article. EGEA shall be<br/>kept informed on the requirements for layoff during regularly-scheduled<br/>consultation meetings. It is intended that any unit member who is<br/>credentialed and competent to perform continuing services will be retained<br/>over more junior employees even if the continued service is outside of the<br/>current assignment.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be provided notice of layoff no less than ten calendar<br/>days prior to its effective date and an opportunity to have a hearing on<br/>the matter before the Administrator of Personnel if a hearing is<br/>demanded within five (5) days of notice.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing shall give the employee the right to present evidence and<br/>provide a defense.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources shall make findings<br/>of fact and render the decision of the District. Should the employee be<br/>reinstated, he or she shall be entitled to back pay for the hours lost.</p>
<p>23.15 Staffing</p>
<p>23.1501 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the beginning of a term, the AEA shall prepare a list of courses to be</p>
<p>offered at that site by program. After preparing that list, the AEA shall make their</p>
<p>assignment to those programs from the eligibility list of staff members currently<br/>teaching at that site. These positions need not be posted.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the responsibility of the AEA to identify courses that meet the<br/>needs of the various programs offered by Adult Education.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AEA shall maintain eligibility lists of qualified employees composed of<br/>those employees currently servicing a site by credential, seniority, past<br/>assignments, and bilingual ability. &quot;Qualified&quot; as used in this sub-section,<br/>shall mean that the applicant has taught the same course or closely related<br/>course in the same subject, possesses the requisite credential, and possesses<br/>the needed instructional skills or qualifications as stated on the job posting.<br/>The AEA shall select from among the qualified applicants at the site to fill<br/>each position.</p>
<p>23.1502 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first priority for assignment shall be the filling of positions by tenured staff<br/>who are guaranteed a number of hours. The second priority for assignment shall<br/>be maximizing the assignment of those who are qualified for benefits. The third<br/>priority for assignment shall be maintaining the current ratio of tenured to non-<br/>tenured positions. The fourth priority for assignment shall be enhancing the hours<br/>of those staff who have been rated above satisfactory in their evaluations. The<br/>fifth priority will be filling positions from the eligibility lists maintained by site<br/>administrators.</p>
<p>a. No unit member shall be entitled to, nor may he or she gain a right to a<br/>continuing assignment of more than full-time.</p>
<p>23.1503 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All remaining new or vacant part-time positions or courses in Adult Education<br/>funded programs shall be posted at the applicable time, reporting site, and each<br/>division thereof by June 1 for year round programs, and August 1 for Adult<br/>Education Programs and by January 5. The posting shall identify the subject(s),<br/>number of hours per week, class schedule and time(s), certification required, any<br/>special skills and qualifications, and the deadline for applications.</p>
<p>a. These vacancies shall be filled by paper screening applications based upon<br/>the priorities in 23.1502 and interviewing no fewer than the top four<br/>candidates.</p>
<p>23.1504 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaining unfilled positions shall be posted at the District Office and at all<br/>Adult Education sites by June 15 for year round programs, August 15 for<br/>traditional programs, and January 15. To apply for such positions a person must<br/>either qualify as provided above or possess other appropriate training and<br/>experience needed for the position, possess the requisite credential, and possess<br/>the instructional skills or qualifications as stated in the job posting. The AEA<br/>shall select from among the applicants.</p>
<p>23.1505 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positions coming available after the beginning of the term may be filled at the<br/>discretion of the AEA.</p>
<p>23.1506 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those to be involuntarily transferred may indicate a preference of assignments to<br/>the AEA.</p>
<p>23.1507 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those to be involuntarily transferred shall, upon written request, have a written<br/>reason for the impending transfer from AEA.</p>
<p>23.1508 Adult Education agrees to make a good faith effort to consider part-time teachers<br/>preference in making assignments. When possible, employees will be notified of<br/>their assignment fifteen (15) calendar days before the beginning of each<br/>semester. Employees may indicate a preference for a change of assignment by<br/>notifying the AEA in writing forty-five (45) days before the beginning of the<br/>next semester.</p>
<p>23.16 Release of Personnel for Unsatisfactory Performance</p>
<p>23.1601 Current personnel in either Adult Education or categorically funded positions do<br/>not have an implied right to employment beyond their assigned term except as<br/>required by the Education Code. However, if they are not to be renewed due to<br/>dissatisfaction with the quality of their services, they shall be evaluated in<br/>accordance with the requirements of this article.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members released for unsatisfactory performance must have been<br/>preceded by compliance with the evaluation provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rights of personnel with an assignment of less than six (6) hours per<br/>week are limited to final notice.</p>

<p>Elk Grove Education Association<br/>September 27, 2013</p>
<p>Elk Grove Unified School District (District) and Elk Grove Education Association<br/>(EGEA), collectively referred to as “the parties,” have considered their mutual<br/>interests and have agreed to enter into this Tentative Agreement (Agreement) to<br/>completely resolve negotiations for the 2013-2014 school year. All of the terms<br/>included in this Agreement are contingent upon approval by the Sacramento<br/>County Office of Education and ratification by both parties.</p>
<p>The parties agree that sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement equal a total<br/>compensation package of 2.7244% and this percentage amount shall be<br/>allocated as follows:</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective retroactive to July 1,2013, an additional two percent (2%) shall<br/>be added to step 19 of the 2013-2014 Certificated Salary Schedule #10<br/>and to step 5 of the 2013-2014 Adult Education Salary Schedule #9.</p>

<p>Add the following paragraph to the beginning of section 8.502:</p>

<p>The parties agree to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by<br/>December 15, 2013, to address class sizes in grades TK-3 and 4-6 for the 2014-<br/>2015 school year that addresses the impact of LCFF. If the parties are unable to</p>
