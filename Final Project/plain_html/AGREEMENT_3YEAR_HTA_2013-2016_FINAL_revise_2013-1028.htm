<p>14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that smaller class sizes in the primary grades are beneficial to the K-8<br/>instructional program.</p>
<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size, however, is dependent upon District resources, the educational needs of<br/>pupils, and the enrollment trends of the District.

The Unit member and site administrator shall discuss student needs<br/>and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions may arise which are not covered by the District safety plan. The unit member<br/>shall consult the local administrator for direction in such situations.

<p>APPENDIX E</p>
<p>4 February 2009<br/>Board of Trustees</p>
<p>Hamilton Union Elementary School District<br/>Hamilton City, CA 95951</p>
<p>Members of the Board:</p>
<p>In an effort to establish a legally acceptable seniority list for certificated<br/>employees, I did some research and have found the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Education Code section 44845 states: “Every probationary or<br/>permanent employee employed after 30 June 1947 shall be deemed to have been<br/>employed on the date upon which he first rendered paid service in a probationary<br/>position. &quot;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Education Code section 44955 states: “As between employees who<br/>first rendered paid service to the district on the same date, the governing board<br/>shall determine the order of termination solely on the basis of the needs of the<br/>district and the students thereof ”</p>
<p>Section 44955 further states that such an employee who is subject to layoff may<br/>request a statement of the specific criteria used in determining the order of<br/>termination and the application of the criteria in ranking each employee relative to the<br/>other employees with the same start date.</p>
<p>To this end, 1 am proposing a procedure for addressing common dates of hire for<br/>certificated employees, model criteria to be used, and rating system to be applied in<br/>accordance with the provisions of Section 44955. Attached for your review and use<br/>are the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model criteria (in the form of a board policy or board-approved<br/>administrative regulation) along with a proposed rating system</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rating calculation form</p>
<p>Other school districts that have laid off certificated employees in the last couple<br/>of years using a fonrt of these model criteria have been successful in sustaining the layoff<br/>decision. Administrative law judges have accepted the criteria as an objective means of<br/>establishing an order of termination for employees with a common start dale. Also,<br/>please note that the former lottery style of breaking ties is no longer considered a valid<br/>method by administrative law judges and has not been accepted since 19S3.</p>

<p>Hamilton Union Elementary School District</p>
<p>CRITERIA TO DETERMINE THE ORDER OF TERMINATION AMONG<br/>CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES WITH THE SAME DATE OF-PAID SERVICE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of establishing criteria</p>
<p>The purpose of adopting criteria for establishing an order to termination of<br/>employees who first rendered paid probationary service to the District on<br/>the same date is to comply with the requirements of Education Code<br/>Section 44955.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criterion to he used</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees finds that to make effective release of employment<br/>decisions, objective criteria must be established. This will ensure that<br/>District employees are treated fairly and equitably. To this end, the needs<br/>of the District and its students will be best served by using the following<br/>criteria in establishing the order of termination described above.</p>
<p>a. Credentials and experience to teach or serve in a particular program<br/>or provide a particular service of need by the District (e.g., bilingual,<br/>special education, etc.)</p>
<p>h. Years of experience previous to current employment as a full-time<br/>credentialed teacher in a probationary/permanent K-12 teaching<br/>situation in a public school</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials that permit supplementary authorizations</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of teaching and/or specialist service credentials</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earned degrees beyond the B.A or B.S. level (e.g.. masters, doctorate)<br/>f Multiple language skills relevant to District need (e.g.. Spanish)</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary v. Clear/Life credentials</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Board Certification</p>
