<p>ARTICLE IX: EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. The District’s evaluation procedures will attempt to provide enough flexibility within the system to allow for<br/>differences in actions, while offering enough direction to identify common expectations. The program of<br/>evaluation and assessment shall apply to all bargaining unit employees according to the employee’s purpose<br/>of employment.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectives</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members to be evaluated during a particular school year shall be furnished with a copy of the<br/>evaluation procedures and forms (see exhibits) and advised of the guidelines upon which the<br/>evaluation is to be based (see exhibits), no later than one week after fall scheduled parent<br/>conferences of the year in which the evaluation is to take place. The goals and objectives and<br/>standards of performance of the employees will be related to the adopted District goals and<br/>curriculum.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee should assess the skills, and/or knowledge of each assigned class. These factors will<br/>affect the identification of objectives, procedures for their attainment, and the methods of<br/>assessment.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee shall submit initial goals and objectives and standards of performance, in writing, to<br/>the administration 20 school days after the beginning of the student calendar year. Either party may<br/>request a meeting to finalize the goals and objectives no later than 30 days after the beginning of the<br/>student year. During the year, modifications of the original objectives and standards may be<br/>necessary. The employee or administration may request a change in these objectives and standards<br/>during the school year by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Procedure:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations: Every employee shall be observed at least one time a year during a year of formal<br/>evaluation. This provision does not limit the number of observation and/or conferences any<br/>employee may receive or request. Classroom observations for the purpose of evaluation shall be as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations shall last at least 30 minutes or preferably, one full teaching lesson.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written memo, relative to the observation, shall be given to the employee within seven<br/>working days (see exhibits).Either party may request a conference to discuss items relative to<br/>the observation.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that an administrative directive is on the observation memo, the employee shall be<br/>provided with a description of the areas needing improvement. The evaluator will confer with<br/>the employee and make specific written recommendations regarding areas of improvement in<br/>the employee’s performance. An employee who receives an unsatisfactory observation shall be<br/>entitled to a subsequent observation and/or conference in an effort to rectify any problems that<br/>were cited. Should subsequent observations reduce or eliminate the deficiencies identified in<br/>the observation, the evaluator shall indicate in writing on the observation memo that<br/>deficiencies have been reduced. The employee will sign this memo and have an opportunity to<br/>attach a written response.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member will receive a single observation for evaluation purposes, it shall occur no<br/>later than March 15.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Stull Evaluation: Each employee shall be evaluated every year. At the administrator’s<br/>suggestion, a permanent employee may mutually agree to be formally evaluated every other school<br/>year as set forth in the Education Code. If an employee is scheduled to be formally evaluated during<br/>a particular school year, but is granted a leave of absence, such evaluation shall take place during the<br/>first year of return. Procedures for formal evaluation shall be as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations (conferences and documentation presentation) shall be completed no later than 30<br/>days prior to the end of the instructional year.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s signature acknowledges only that the employee has received the document.<br/>The employee may attach a written statement which shall become part of the permanent<br/>record.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If seven (7) of eight (8) Standards (Items 1-6, 9-10) on the Evaluation Summary (Exhibit C)<br/>are marked unsatisfactory, then the unit member shall be referred to the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Program.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, according to AB 954, the evaluation and assessment may occur at least every<br/>five years. Eligible bargaining unit members must have permanent status, have been employed<br/>at least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, as defined, and whose previous<br/>evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards. The teacher and evaluator<br/>must mutally agree to the extended time line and either party may withdraw this consent at any<br/>time.</p>
<p>3. Miscellaneous:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No member of the bargaining unit other than the employee being evaluated shall participate in the<br/>normal evaluation process.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has the right to have a witness present during any of the evaluation procedures</p>
<p>excluding unannounced classroom observation time.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any information used in the evaluation must be information obtained through direct observation by<br/>the evaluator or information contained in the personnel file.</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualified employees shall select a Central Valley Trust health, dental and vision plan. The total dollar<br/>premium for the above benefit package will be as follows and will establish a dollar cap contribution by<br/>the District: effective September 1, 2004 the cap shall be $637.67 per month/121y (yearly cap of<br/>$7,652.00).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide the following fringe benefit coverage of all bargaining unit members<br/>working 75 percent or more of full time and their eligible dependents (i.e., for purposes of health<br/>benefit coverage only, 75% of full time is 75% X # of contracted days X 7 hours) except when a 7<br/>hour employee is hired to complete an otherwise full-time assignment for that year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees working less than 75% or more of full time may elect to be covered by existing<br/>insurance programs so long as they pay their prorated share of the premiums by payroll deduction.<br/>The District shall contribute a prorated amount of the cap equal to the percentage worked by the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired District unit members may retain the District health benefit package at their own expense,<br/>regardless of age, at the same monthly premium rate as regular employees. Retirees who elect<br/>Medicare coverage as the primary insurer at age 65 or thereafter may continue to use CVT as the<br/>secondary insurance carrier at their own expense and will pay the prevailing rates for such coverage.<br/>Health premium payments shall be made monthly, in advance, and arrangements shall be made with<br/>the District Business Office prior to retirement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other current employees may elect to continue with existing coverage or any other plan allowed by CVT<br/>and the employee would be responsible for paying any increased cost for that coverage above the<br/>District’s contribution.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing Education and Professional Growth is encouraged for all regular full time and part time<br/>employees. A maximum of $300 will be allowed for full time certificated employees and pro-rated for<br/>part time employees for college courses, other classes, and conferences with prior approval by the<br/>District (see also Article XX E5, PAR). Allowable reimbursable expenses may include registration fees<br/>or tuition, books, mileage expenses, substitute cost and other approved expenses. Educational courses<br/>must enhance school district educational programs. Receipts must be presented before reimbursement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must submit a Pre-Authorization Form approved by the school site principal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee can be reimbursed within approximately two (2) weeks for registration, tuition, and<br/>books, mileage, and other approved expenses with receipts.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For accountability, course completion documentation or evidence of attendance must be given the<br/>District Office. If the course or conference is not completed, the individual must reimburse the<br/>district within 120 days. Payroll deduction authorization must be signed.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fringe Benefit Cap is $8,149.44</p>

In the<br/>event that a unit member shall not pay such fee directly to the Association, or authorize payment through<br/>payroll deduction as provided in Section A, the Association shall so inform the District and the District<br/>shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in Education Code section 45061 and<br/>in the same manner as set forth in Section A of this Article.

<p>ARTICLE XIV: PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will deduct from the pay of Association members and pay to the Association the normal and<br/>regular monthly Association membership dues as voluntarily authorized in writing, and until revoked in<br/>writing, by the employee on a District form subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. Such deduction shall be made only upon submission of the District form to the designated</p>
<p>representative of the District duly completed and executed by the employee and the Association.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed or discontinued deduction until the</p>
<p>pay period commencing fifteen (15) days or more after such submission.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XV: LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>A. Sick Leave:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each bargaining unit member shall be entitled to ten (10) days paid Sick Leave each year. Unused Sick<br/>Leave shall accrue from school year to school year. Sick Leave entitlement shall be prorated for part-time<br/>employees.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon returning from leave, the bargaining unit member will submit a statement of the number of Sick Leave<br/>days used and the reason for the absence on a form provided by the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where the District has a reasonable suspicion of abuse of this leave provision in which case, a<br/>medical verification could be requested at any time.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a unit member to present a medical release to return to duty from leave due to<br/>serious illness or injury.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each unit member with a written statement of the accrued total amount of Sick<br/>Leave available to the member. This statement shall be provided no later than October 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledging that use of regular and accumulated Sick Leave as stated herein reduces a unit member’s<br/>Sick Leave entitlement for his/her own illness or injury and potentially reduces a unit member’s retirement</p>
<p>allowance, a unit member may use, in any school year, up to one-half (1/2) of their annual allowance of Sick<br/>Leave credited per Paragraph A1 above (ie. 5 days) and any or all accumulated Sick Leave to care for a child,<br/>parent or spouse with a serious health condition pursuant to Labor Code section 233.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For leave under Article XV, section A.5., parent means a biological, foster, or adoptive parent, a step<br/>parent or a legal guardian.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For leave under Article XV, section A.5., child means a biological, foster or adopted child, a<br/>stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differential Pav Leave:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year when a unit member has exhausted all earned Sick Leave, including all accumulated<br/>sick leave, additional non-accumulative leave shall be available for a period not to exceed five (5) school<br/>months.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount deducted from the bargaining unit member’s salary during the five (5) month period shall be the<br/>amount actually paid a substitute employee to fill the position during the leave. If no substitute is employed,<br/>the amount deducted shall be the amount that would have paid the substitute had a substitute been employed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member shall not be provided more than one five (5) month period per illness or accident.<br/>However, if a school year is terminated before the five (5) month period is exhausted, the employee may take<br/>the balance of the five (5) month period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member exhausts all available leave, including accumulated Sick Leave and the five</p>
<p>(5) month Differential Pay Leave, and continues to be absent on account of illness or accident, and is not<br/>medically able to resume the duties of his or her position, the employee shall, if not placed in another<br/>position, be placed on a re-employment list for a period of 24-months if the employee is on probationary<br/>status or 39-months if the employee is on permanent status.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the unit member is medically able, during the 24 or 39-month period, the employee shall be returned to<br/>employment in a position for which he or she is credentialed and qualified.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be entitled to Industrial Accident Leave according to the provisions of Education Code<br/>section 44984 for personal injury which has qualified for workers’ compensation benefits under the<br/>provisions of the Schools Insurance Group.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident Leave shall not exceed sixty (60) working days in any one fiscal year. Such leave shall<br/>not be accumulated from year to year. Industrial Accident Leave shall commence on the first day of absence<br/>and shall not be charged to Sick Leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Industrial Accident or Illness Leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the unit member shall be entitled<br/>to take only the amount of unused leave remaining for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to have the unit member examined, at the District’s expense, by a qualified<br/>physician selected by the member from a panel of three physicians. The physician will be utilized to assist<br/>the District in determining the length of time the unit member will be unable to perform his or her assigned<br/>duties and the degree to which the teacher is disabled from the injury.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall endorse to the District all workers’ compensation benefit checks from Schools<br/>Insurance Group. The District shall, in turn, issue the employee the appropriate salary warrants for payment<br/>of the employee’s full salary, less the normal taxes and other authorized deductions.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member fails to endorse to the District any workers’ compensation benefit check received on<br/>account of the industrial accident or illness, the District shall deduct from the unit member’s salary warrant<br/>the amount of such disability indemnity actually paid to the unit member.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to work programs established by the District shall be consistent with current contract language.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to use Sick Leave (Paragraph A) and Differential Pay Leave (Paragraph B) for<br/>disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom on the<br/>same terms and conditions governing leaves of absence for other illness or medical disability.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member absent as a result of pregnancy disability may choose to be placed on unpaid leave during the<br/>period of pregnancy disability.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member and her physician or practitioner shall determine as far in advance of the anticipated date of<br/>childbirth as is feasible the date on which her pregnancy will disable her from the performance of her duties.<br/>She shall then report that date to her site administrator so that substitute services may be arranged.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member and her physician or practitioner shall determine and report to the unit member’s site<br/>administrator the date on which she is likely to be physically capable of returning to her duties following the<br/>termination of her paid or unpaid pregnancy disability leave. In case of suspected abuse, the District may<br/>require verification of such disability through a physical examination of the employee, at the District’s<br/>expense, by a physician selected by the member from a panel of three physicians who have been<br/>recommended by the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member on leave for pregnancy disability shall be entitled to return to the same position or a<br/>position comparable to that held at the time the leave commenced.</p>
<p>6. At the conclusion of all paid leave and any unpaid leave taken as a result of disabilities caused or contributed<br/>to by pregnancy, a unit member shall be entitled to utilize up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid Family Medical<br/>Leave Act/Califomia Family Rights Act (“FMLA/CFRA”) leave to care for her child. During this period of<br/>up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid FMLA/CFRA leave, the District shall continue to pay its maximum<br/>monthly contribution toward the cost of the employee’s health and welfare benefits and the employee shall be<br/>obligated to pay her monthly contribution toward the cost of such benefits by the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) of each month.</p>
<p>E. Family Care Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may take unpaid leave for a total of twelve (12) weeks in a twelve (12) month period to care<br/>for a newborn or newly adopted child, for the unit member’s serious health condition or for a seriously ill<br/>family member. Family members shall include spouse, son, daughter or parent.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious health condition involves either:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inpatient care in a medical facility; or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing treatment by a health care provider that includes:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A period of incapacity requiring absence from work or other regular daily activities of more<br/>than three consecutive calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of recovery,<br/>provided that there is medical treatment on a least two occasions or a regimen of continuing<br/>treatment;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incapacity due to pregnancy;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition that is, a condition that requires periodic<br/>visit for treatment, continues over an extended period of time and may have episodic periods of<br/>incapacity;</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent and long-term incapacity due to a condition for which treatment may not be<br/>effective;</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any absence to receive multiple treatments either for restorative surgery or for a condition that<br/>would likely result in a period of incapacity of over three calendar days in the absence of<br/>treatment, such as chemotherapy and dialysis.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son or daughter means biological, adopted or foster child, step-child, legal ward, or child of person in<br/>loco parentis who is under 18, or if older, incapable of self care because of a mental or physical<br/>disability.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent means biological parent or person who stands or stood in loco parentis, and does not include<br/>parents in law.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the unit member requesting unpaid leave for care of an ill or injured family member, the unit<br/>member must submit, with the request for the leave, a statement from the treating physician or practitioner<br/>that includes the date the condition commenced or will commence, the probable duration of the condition,<br/>the need for the employee’s care of the individual, and the estimated length of time the employee’s care is<br/>needed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on FMLA leave because of his or her own serious illness shall use all accrued paid Sick Leave<br/>and Differential Pay Leave at the beginning of any otherwise paid FMLA leave period and such paid leaves<br/>used for a unit member’s own serious health condition shall run concurrently with and reduce the total of<br/>unpaid FMLA leave on a day by day basis. For any portion of the 12 weeks of FMLA not covered by paid<br/>leave, the District shall continue its contribution for group health insurance for any remaining portion of the<br/>12 weeks for which the employee is on unpaid leave.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledging that the use of regular and accumulated Sick Leave as stated in Paragraph A5 could<br/>potentially reduce a unit member’s retirement allowance and would reduce a unit member’s Sick Leave<br/>entitlement for his/her own illness or injury, a unit member may use Sick Leave to the extent set forth in</p>
<p>Paragraph A5 to care for a child, parent or spouse with a serious health condition. Paid leaves used for this<br/>purpose shall run concurrent with the twelve (12) weeks of unpaid family care leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member is required to give at least thirty (30) days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if<br/>the need for the leave is foreseeable. When thirty (30) days notice is not possible, the unit member shall<br/>give as much notice as practicable.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may request an additional period of unpaid leave for the employee’s own serious illness or to<br/>care for an ill family member. The provision of such leave is at the discretion of the Board of Trustees of<br/>the District.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On timely return to work following the expiration of the FMLA leave period, an employee is entitled to the<br/>same or a comparable position.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to a maximum of three (3) days leave of absence, or five (5) days leave of<br/>absence if out of state travel is required, without loss of salary, on account of the death of an immediate<br/>family member. This leave shall not be cumulative and shall not be deducted from the unit member’s Sick<br/>Leave allotment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Immediate Family” is limited to the unit member’s mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, or grandchild<br/>of the employee or spouse of the employee, and the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law,<br/>brother or sister of the employee or any relative living in the immediate household of the employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there are special circumstances, the District may grant an additional two (2) days of leave for in-state<br/>utilization.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled, at his or her election, to use up to eight (8) days of accumulated Sick Leave<br/>during any school year in cases of personal necessity. This leave shall not be used for illegal activities.<br/>Requests shall be submitted on the required District forms.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior notice of twenty-four (24) hours to the unit member’s site administration and the site administrator’s<br/>authorization is required for compelling personal necessity. Compelling personal necessity leave shall be<br/>granted automatically, on a first come first serve basis, for up to 10% of the number of unit members at the<br/>site. The site administrator’s approval is required if the 10% site limitation has been exceeded.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity may be taken for the following reasons with no advanced notification required.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the employee’s immediate family as defined in Bereavement<br/>Leave.</p>

<p>1. Employees may be excused to serve on jury duty. The District will pay the employee for the actual time they<br/>serve on the jury. Any pay granted by the court for jury service will be signed over to the District, exclusive<br/>of mileage expenses. Request for leave of this type will be submitted on proper District forms.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave:</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorization for Sabbatical Leave shall be at the discretion of the Board of Trustees. Consideration<br/>shall be dependent upon the financial condition of the District, and/or the benefit such leave will provide the<br/>District.</p>
<p>4. The unit member shall notify the District in writing on or before February 15 whether he or she intends to<br/>return to regular duty at the commencement of the next school year. Failure to so notify will be considered<br/>an abandonment of his or her position with the District.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVI: RETIREMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement Incentives: The Nevada City School District shall make available on a voluntary basis to<br/>members of the Nevada City Teachers Association bargaining unit four retirement incentive programs. The<br/>District does this in appreciation and recognition of the employee’s many years of quality service to the<br/>children of Nevada City. Employees may choose to participate in only one program.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A signed letter of resignation and stated interest in any of these programs must be received by the district<br/>prior to March 1<sup>st</sup> during the final year of service. This date may be waived at the discretion of the<br/>Board of Trustees, for extraordinary circumstances beyond the employee’s control. The preferred<br/>program and option shall be stated in the resignation letter.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following early retirement incentive programs must provide cost savings or be at least cost neutral<br/>for each applicant as a condition of approval.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may restrict the number of approved early incentive programs, under this article, to the first<br/>four qualifying applicants.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program Descriptions:</p>
<p>1. Program I: Early Incentive Program</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible employees who retire from active service shall receive a monetary sum equal to the<br/>difference between step (6) of the certificated salary schedule in the year in which they retire and the<br/>amount of their regular annual salary in their final school year of employment with the district not to<br/>exceed Step 20.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible teachers may elect to receive the retirement incentive sum under one of the following<br/>options:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lump sum payment from the District to the retiree to be issued after completion of active<br/>service with the District.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuance of the District-paid health plan for the retiree, as for continuing employees. The<br/>District will cease the monthly payments when an amount equal to the retirement incentive<br/>sum has been paid out by the District in monthly premiums or upon the death of the retiree,<br/>whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other payment options equal to the retirement incentive sum that may be proposed by the<br/>retiree will be considered by the District. However, the District retains the sole authority to</p>
<p>accept or reject such options.</p>
<p>c. When a person retires under Program 1 who has worked less than full-time during the 15 years of<br/>service, the retiree’s award under this program will be prorated in relationship to how many full time<br/>equivalent years the retiree has in relation to the full 15 full time equivalent years.</p>
<p>For example: A teacher works five (5) years at full time and 12 years at half time. We use 180 days to represent a full<br/>years service.</p>
<p>years (full time) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 x 180=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;900</p>
<p>years (half time) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 x 90=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1080</p>
<p>1980</p>
<p>15 years (FTE) @ 180 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1980=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.73</p>
<p>_The teacher in the above example would receive 73% of the difference in their salary and step 6_</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest shall not be calculated or paid on the retirement incentive sum for any of the options of<br/>payment.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be eligible for the Retirement Incentive Program 1, and employee must meet all of the following<br/>criteria:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve in a position represented by the Nevada City Faculty Association contract as specified<br/>under Article II Recognition.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has not reached age 60 by June 30 of their final year of employment.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have completed at least 15 years service in the District in a certificated<br/>position prior to retirement. Authorized leaves neither interrupt years of service nor add to<br/>years of service.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have either reached the age of 55 or the sum of the employee’s age plus<br/>their years of full time equivalent certificated service must be equal to at least 75.</p>
