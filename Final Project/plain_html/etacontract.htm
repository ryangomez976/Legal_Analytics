<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is defined as a claim by the Association or by one<br/>or more teachers that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;aggrieved person&quot; is the person or persons, including the<br/>Association or representatives thereof, making the claim.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;party in interest&quot; is any person who might be required to<br/>take action, or against whom action might be taken, in order to<br/>resolve the claim.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose:</p>
<p>1. The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest<br/>possible administrative level, equitable solutions to the<br/>problems which may from time to time arise. Both parties<br/>agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right<br/>of any unit member having a grievance to discuss the matter<br/>informally with any appropriate member of the administration,<br/>and to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by the<br/>Association provided it is agreeable to the parties involved.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as<br/>possible, the time limits specified at each level should be<br/>considered to be maximum and every effort should be made to<br/>expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be<br/>extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One:</p>
<p>An aggrieved person will notify the immediate supervisor of the<br/>grievance either directly or through the Association's<br/>designated grievance representative with the objective<br/>resolving the matter informally, within ten (10) days after the<br/>occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance.<br/>If the unit member does not have actual or constructive<br/>knowledge of the occurrence of the grievable act or omission<br/>and could not, with the exercise of reasonable diligence, have<br/>known about it, then the ten (10) day time limit shall begin to<br/>run on the date upon which the unit member knew, or should,<br/>with reasonable diligence, have known of the occurrence.</p>
<p>The immediate supervisor shall schedule a meeting within five<br/>(5) days of receipt of the notification from the aggrieved<br/>person that there is a grievance to be discussed. If the<br/>immediate supervisor should fail to schedule the meeting<br/>within five (5) days of receiving the notification of the existence<br/>of a grievance, or if the parties cannot agree upon an extension<br/>of the five-day time period so that the meeting can take place,<br/>the aggrieved person may proceed to Level 2 on the day<br/>following the five-day period for holding a meeting.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two:</p>
<p>Within five (5) days after the Level 1 meeting, if the grievance<br/>is not resolved, the aggrieved person must present the<br/>grievance in writing to the superintendent/designee. A written<br/>statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance,<br/>including the specific provisions of the agreement alleged to<br/>have been violated, the circumstances involved, the decision<br/>rendered at the informal conference, and the specific remedy<br/>sought. The superintendent/designee shall communicate a<br/>written response within ten (10) days after receipt of the<br/>grievance. Either party may request a personal conference, to<br/>be scheduled prior to the conclusion of the level.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>3. Level Three:</p>
<p>If a grievance is not resolved in Levels One or Two, the<br/>employee and/or the Association may request in writing a<br/>hearing before an arbitrator. The written request shall be filed<br/>in the Office of the Superintendent within ten (10) working<br/>days after receipt of the written decision at Level Two.</p>
<p>The Association either in its own behalf or in behalf of the<br/>affected teachers, may initiate a grievance which affects more<br/>than one unit member in a single building or unit members in<br/>more than one building at Level One.</p>
<p>The District and Association shall select a mutually acceptable<br/>arbitrator. Should they be unable to agree on an arbitrator<br/>within ten (10) working days of the Association's submission of<br/>the grievance to arbitration, submission of the grievance shall<br/>be made to the American Arbitration Association. In any<br/>event, the parties will then be bound by the rules and<br/>procedures of the American Arbitration Association in the<br/>selection of an arbitrator and the arbitrator shall proceed under<br/>the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of said Association.</p>
<p>The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth<br/>findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues<br/>submitted. The arbitrator will be without power or authority to<br/>make any decisions which requires the commission of an act<br/>prohibited by law or which is violative of the terms of this<br/>Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is<br/>empowered to include in any decision such financial<br/>reimbursement or other remedies as he/she judges to be<br/>proper. The recommended decisions of the arbitrator will be<br/>submitted to the Superintendent and the Association.</p>
<p>The Board will determine whether to accept the arbitrator's<br/>recommended decision within thirty (30) days of receiving the<br/>recommended decision.</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not<br/>limited to, per diem expenses, his/her travel and subsistence<br/>expenses and the cost of any hearing room will be borne<br/>equally by the District and the Association. All other costs will<br/>be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>D.</p>
<p>Rights of Unit Members to Representation:</p>
<p>A unit member may represent himself/herself at all stages of<br/>the grievance procedure by himself/herself, or, at the<br/>member's option, by a representative selected by the<br/>Association. If a unit member is not represented by the<br/>Association or its representative, a representative of the<br/>Association may have the right to be present and to state its<br/>views at all stages of the grievance procedure, if the aggrieved<br/>party so desires.</p>
<p>E. Miscellaneous:</p>
<p>Decisions rendered at Levels One and Two of the grievance<br/>procedure will be in writing setting forth the decision and the<br/>reasons therefore, and will be transmitted promptly to all<br/>parties of interest and to the President of the Association. Time<br/>limits for appeal provided in each Level shall begin the day<br/>following receipt of written decision by the parties of interest.</p>
<p>When it is necessary for a representative designated by the<br/>Association to investigate a grievance or attend a grievance<br/>meeting or hearing during the day, he/she will, upon notice to<br/>his/her principal or immediate superior by the President of the<br/>Association, be released without loss of pay in order to permit<br/>participation in the foregoing activities. Any unit member who<br/>is requested to appear in such investigations, meetings, or<br/>hearings as a witness will be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>All documents, communications and records dealing with the<br/>processing of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance<br/>file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII<br/>PROFESSIONAL DUES AND PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>Any unit member who is a non-member or member of the Association, or<br/>who has applied for membership, will have unified membership dues, agency<br/>fees, or in lieu of charity contributions automatically deducted from their<br/>tenthly payroll. Pursuant to such statutory requirement, the District shall<br/>deduct one tenth of such amounts from the regular salary check of the unit<br/>member each month for ten months. Deductions for unit members who<br/>begin employment after the commencement of the school year shall be<br/>appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to<br/>fulfill the previsions of this Article. The Association shall indemnify and</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>defend the district against all claims, grievances, unfair labor practice<br/>charges, law-suits, or other legal challenges which may be brought by a unit<br/>member as a result of the District's implementation of this article.</p>
<p>Upon appropriate written authorization from the unit member, the District<br/>may deduct from the salary of any unit member and make appropriate<br/>remittance for annuities, credit union, savings bonds, charitable donations, or<br/>any other plans or programs jointly approved by the Association and the<br/>District. The deduction of money for charity in lieu of union dues must be<br/>approved by the Association and submitted in writing to the district prior to<br/>said payroll deduction.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>UNIT MEMBER WORK HOURS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Member Work Hours. The unit member work day shall begin<br/>30 minutes before the opening of school, and shall normally continue<br/>7-Vi hours, including lunch. Because the nature of a unit member's<br/>day-to-day professional responsibilities does not lend itself to an<br/>instructional day of rigidly established length, unit members shall<br/>remain at the school site to work during the established 7-Vi hour<br/>work day, exclusive of the unit member's lunch period, and shall<br/>remain on site beyond such hours as needed to perform their<br/>additional instructional and professional duties.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructional Professional Responsibilities.</p>
<p>These duties include the planning of lessons, preparation of materials<br/>for instruction, review and evaluation of work of students, and<br/>conferring and counseling with students, parents, staff, and<br/>administrators, maintaining student records, and attending in service,<br/>faculty, departmental, grade level, and student study team meetings.<br/>Such instructional duties also include assigned supervision of students<br/>within and outside the classroom, participation in back-to-school<br/>night, open house, promotion, parent conferences, parent teacher<br/>meetings, IEP meetings and certain evening performances by pupils.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Instructional Professional Responsibilities.</p>
<p>Non-instructional responsibilities, beyond the above defined duties,<br/>will be distributed by the site administrator as equitably as possible.<br/>Such responsibilities include, but are not necessarily limited to,<br/>special school programs, dances, carnivals, field trips outside of the<br/>regular school day, assigned school committees, and emergency<br/>needs.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced Instructional Dav for Parent Conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional</p>
<p>Track Programs.</p>
<p>During the parent - teacher conference period for the fall trimester,<br/>pupil instructional days for grades 1 through 8 shall be reduced by 1-<br/>1/2 hours daily on days established in the District's student calendar.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Departure on Pavs of Evening Programs.</p>
<p>On instructional days when unit members are required to return to<br/>school in the evening, a unit member may leave at the time his/her<br/>class is dismissed for the day, provided that his/her classroom is<br/>prepared for the evening program and for the next instructional day<br/>and as long as professional duties described in section B have been<br/>completed.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Departure of Dav Preceding Break Periods.</p>
<p>On the final instructional day before Thanksgiving, the winter, spring,<br/>and summer recesses, instruction for grades 1-8 shall be shortened<br/>by 1-1/2 hour. A unit member may leave after the student dismissal<br/>time as long as professional duties described in section B have been<br/>completed.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Time: Intermediate Schools.</p>
<p>Unit members assigned at a District intermediate school shall have<br/>one preparation period during the regular instructional day. The<br/>preparation period shall be utilized by unit members for the purposes<br/>discussed in section B. The site administrator may reserve no more<br/>than one preparation period per week per unit member for required<br/>staff meetings or in-service. In addition, to the one preparation<br/>period during the regular instructional day effective July 1, 2014, the<br/>site Administrator may utilize one additional prep period during a<br/>week, not to exceed ten (10) weeks. It is understood and agreed that<br/>in the case of holidays, parent-teacher conferences, teacher absence<br/>from the school site, in-service or staff meetings described in this<br/>paragraph, that regularly scheduled preparation time missed will not<br/>be made up.</p>
<p>6 minimum days are available for the District's middle schools, to be<br/>directed by the principals for staff development, in-service and<br/>programs development.</p>
<p>Teachers who are selected to teach a sixth period shall receive one-<br/>sixth (1/6) of their daily rate for such additional assignment where<br/>the assignment is of 30 teaching days or more in duration. Should<br/>circumstances occur which necessitate the need for a teacher(s) to<br/>teach a sixth period, to the extent the master schedule allows, unit<br/>members at that site with the appropriate credentials and skills shall<br/>be given equal opportunity to assume this additional sixth period<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Time: Elementary Schools.</p>
<p>The designated purposes assigned to minimum days are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 minimum days are available for the District's elementary</p>
<p>schools, for required staff meetings, in-service, or program<br/>development as determined by the site administrator.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining minimum days shall be used for teacher<br/>planning and preparation. These planning and preparation<br/>minimum days shall be utilized by unit members for the<br/>purposes discussed in Article IX, Section B of the collective<br/>bargaining agreement. It is understood that in case of holidays,<br/>parent teacher conferences, teacher absence from the school<br/>site, in-service or staff meetings, that regularly scheduled<br/>elementary school preparation time missed will not be made<br/>up.</p>
<p>The decision as to which minimum days will be selected for the<br/>5 that are directed by the Elementary Principals (see (1)<br/>above) is to be made by the principals of the school with input<br/>from the school's staff through its leadership team, if<br/>applicable. During a school year in which the school site is<br/>participating in Program Quality Review, Coordinated<br/>Compliance Review, Distinguished School Application, Blue<br/>Ribbon School Application, or any other state mandated review<br/>process, the elementary principal may direct 10 minimum days.<br/>This decision will be made with the intent of selecting principal<br/>directed minimum days so as to best meet the needs of each<br/>individual school staff by allowing planning and preparation<br/>minimum days (see (2) above) to be selected for use during<br/>optimum periods.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 2014-15 school year the District will<br/>provide up to thirty (30) preparation periods each school year<br/>for unit members assigned to grades 4 and 5. These<br/>preparation periods will be 40 minutes in duration during the<br/>instructional day. The preparation period shall be utilized by<br/>unit members for the purposes discussed in section B. The site<br/>administrator may reserve no more than ten (10) of these<br/>periods for required staff meetings, grade level meetings,<br/>trainings or in-service.</p>
<p>This arrangement shall not be subject to the contractual<br/>grievance procedure outlined in Article VII of this agreement.</p>
<p>Preparation Time SDC/RSP/SLP elementary/middle, grades Pre K-8</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Special Education Teacher in the above assignment,<br/>grades Pre K-8, will be entitled to the same number of summer<br/>planning days as the regular education teachers at their<br/>assigned school site/program.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district will provide three (3) release days per year for the<br/>purposes of writing/attending IEP's, conducting student<br/>assessments, IEP goal monitoring, observation of students, and<br/>collaborations with other specialist and support providers.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 2014-15 school year the District will<br/>provide up to thirty (30) preparation periods each school year<br/>for unit members assigned to grades 1-5, teaching Special Day<br/>Classes. These preparation periods will be 40 minutes in<br/>duration during the instructional day. The preparation period<br/>shall be utilized by unit members for the purposes discussed in<br/>Section A. The site administrator may reserve no more than<br/>ten (10) of these periods for required staff meetings, grade<br/>level meetings, trainings or in-service.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the limited availability of substitutes, the schedule for<br/>such coverage must be coordinated between the principal, the<br/>teacher, and the District. In the event that substitutes must be<br/>&quot;pulled&quot; from coverage to cover absences elsewhere in the<br/>District, the District will make every reasonable effort to<br/>provide the coverage. If coverage cannot be rescheduled, the<br/>teacher may submit a time card for a full day of pay at the<br/>curriculum/instructional rate.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five (5) Minimum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the District's</p>
<p>Elementary Special &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required staff</p>
<p>meetings, in-service, or program development as required by<br/>the District and their Site Administrator. The total number of<br/>required minimum day meetings (site meetings and Special<br/>Education meetings combined) for the District's Elementary<br/>Special Education Teachers cannot exceed five (5).</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six (6) Minimum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the District's</p>
<p>Intermediate Special Education Teachers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required staff</p>
<p>meetings, in-service, or program development as required by<br/>the District and their Site Administrator. The total number of<br/>required minimum day meetings (site meetings and Special<br/>Education meetings combined) for the District's Intermediate<br/>Special Education Teachers cannot exceed six (6).</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers assigned to more than one site shall receive the<br/>greatest number of summer planning days issued by their<br/>sites.</p>
<p>The District proposes an MOU commencing with the 2014-15 school year<br/>continuing until the 2015-16 school year to provide up to thirty (30)<br/>preparation periods for the unit members assigned to grades 1 through 3<br/>each school year. These preparation periods will be forty (40) minutes in<br/>duration during the instructional day. The preparation period shall be utilized<br/>by unit members for the purposes discussed in B. The site administrator may<br/>reserve no more than ten (10) of these periods for required staff meetings,<br/>grade level meetings, training or in-service.</p>

<p>Extra-Curricular Stipends Extra-curricular stipend duties include<br/>coaching and supervision of before and after school sports, or service<br/>as an assigned advisor for extra-curricular duties initiated and approved<br/>by the site administrator as described in Article XVIII - Salaries.<br/>Stipends for these responsibilities are set forth in Article XVIII<br/>&quot;Salaries&quot;.</p>
<p>The site administrator shall provide an opportunity, by posting a notice<br/>on site prior to the assignment of an extra-curricular duty for which a<br/>stipend is paid, for unit members assigned to the site to indicate<br/>interest, in writing, in being considered for the assignment. The<br/>assignment of the extra-curricular duty is at the sole discretion of the<br/>site administrator.</p>
<p>In the event no unit member at the site indicates interest in the<br/>assignment, or no unit member at the site meets the approval of the<br/>site administrator, the District will advertise the extra-curricular<br/>assignment at each school site in the District by posting a notice at<br/>each school site for a period of no less than 72 hours. Any unit<br/>member who is selected from another site must be able to meet the<br/>time schedule requirements for the extra-curricular duty, and the<br/>extra-curricular duty must not interfere with the other instructional and<br/>professional duties of the unit member. The assignment of the extra¬<br/>curricular duty is at the sole discretion of the site administrator.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>ABSENCE AND LEAVE PROVISIONS</p>
<p>A. General Provisions</p>
<p>A leave of absence is an authorization for the unit member's absence<br/>from duty for a specific period of time and an approved purpose. A<br/>condition of each leave of absence is that any required license or<br/>certificate held at the time the leave was granted must be maintained<br/>in full force by the unit member. Unit members on paid leave of<br/>absence, unless otherwise provided herein, shall receive wages,<br/>fringe benefits, and retirement credit as though they were not on<br/>leave. Unit members who go on an unpaid leave during any pay<br/>period shall receive fringe benefits for the balance of that pay period.<br/>Thereafter, they shall be allowed to remain on continued coverage<br/>pursuant to the terms of the insurance plan selected at their own<br/>expense, provided they make advance payment of the premium in a<br/>manner reasonably required by the District. Procedures in this Article<br/>for notification of absence are mandatory. Failure to follow absence<br/>notification procedures may result in forfeiture of salary for the day(s)<br/>of absence.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>On the day the unit member returns to active service, he/she shall<br/>complete an employee absence report, and shall submit it to the<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>Unit members shall notify the District of their anticipated absence as<br/>soon as the need for the leave of absence is known, but in no event<br/>less than one hour before the unit member's normal reporting time.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>
<p>Unit members shall accrue sick leave at the rate of ten (10) days per<br/>year. Accrued but unused sick leave shall be carried forward from<br/>year to year.</p>
<p>The District may require a physician's verification of illness for a unit<br/>member's absence of five (5) or more consecutive days. In addition,<br/>the District &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may require&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when misuse of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave is</p>
<p>suspected. A physician's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be made&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;licensed</p>
<p>health care provider.</p>
<p>When a unit member is disabled and unable to work during an<br/>absence, a physician's verification shall be made by a licensed health<br/>care provider. The verification shall confirm that the unit member<br/>was disabled and unable to work during the absence, the beginning<br/>and ending &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dates of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disability,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall verify&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the unit</p>
<p>member is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his/her regular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duties. The</p>
<p>verification shall also describe in detail any functional limitations and<br/>the anticipated time period for which the duties are restricted, and<br/>any proposed accommodations that the physician suggests for the<br/>District's consideration to enable the unit member to perform the<br/>essential functions of the position.</p>
<p>A unit member may utilize sick leave for absences necessitated by<br/>her pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery there from, with<br/>a physician's verification.</p>
<p>A unit member who serves 75% or more of the instructional days of<br/>summer school shall accrue 0.5 (one half) sick days. While teaching<br/>summer school, a unit member may use up to two (2) days of<br/>accrued sick leave for absences covered in this article. Each day of<br/>summer school missed shall result in a deduction of one day of sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident and Illness Leave</p>
<p>Industrial accident or illness leave shall be for a maximum of sixty<br/>(60) days within a fiscal year. Industrial accident/illness leave begins<br/>on the first day of absence caused by the accident. Such leave shall<br/>not accumulate from year to year. At no time shall a unit member,<br/>due to the operation of industrial accident or illness leave receive</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>more than his/her contract salary. When an industrial accident or<br/>illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the unit member who<br/>continues to be disabled due to the industrial accident or illness may<br/>continue on such leave for the number of remaining days of the<br/>original sixty (60) days.</p>
<p>No benefits shall be paid to a unit member under the provisions for<br/>industrial accident or illness leave unless and until a duly licensed<br/>physician verifies in writing the industrial nature of the accident or<br/>illness, and, further, until the District's workers' compensation<br/>administrator reaches a final determination that the accident or illness<br/>is work related.</p>
<p>The leave shall terminate at any time before the end of the sixty (60)<br/>days if the physician indicates that the unit member is well enough to<br/>resume his/her duties.</p>
<p>In order to receive full salary with normal deductions, a unit member<br/>on industrial accident/illness leave shall endorse to the District any<br/>temporary disability checks received on account of the industrial<br/>accident/illness. If, upon the termination of the industrial<br/>accident/illness leave the employee continues to receive payments<br/>from the Workers' Compensation Fund, only that amount of regular<br/>sick leave shall be deducted which will yield the unit member's full<br/>contractual salary for the period, less normal deductions.</p>
<p>D. Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>Unit members shall be entitled to use up to seven (7) days of paid<br/>sick leave in each school year in the following cases of personal<br/>necessity:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of a member of the immediate family defined as mother,<br/>father, husband, wife, domestic partner, son, daughter, brother,<br/>sister, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-<br/>law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandmother, grandfather,<br/>grandson, or granddaughter of the employee, or the death of<br/>any other person living in their immediate household of the<br/>employee, when additional leave is required beyond that<br/>provided by Bereavement Leave provisions.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Accident involving the person or property of the unit<br/>member or of a member of the member's immediate family as<br/>defined above. The accident must be of such an emergency<br/>nature that the immediate presence of the unit member is<br/>required during the regular work day.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in Court as a litigant, or as a witness under<br/>order of subpoena.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious or critical illness of a member of the unit member's<br/>immediate family, as defined above. The illness must be of<br/>such a serious or critical nature that the immediate presence of<br/>the employee is required during his/her regular work day.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial A condition or circumstance which, if unattended,<br/>would result in an unconscionable financial loss materially<br/>affecting the unit member's ability to maintain reasonable<br/>conditions of sustenance for the member and dependents.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious holiday or observance of the member's faith which<br/>cannot be conducted outside of regular working hours.</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth or adoption of the unit member's child within one<br/>(1) month of such event.</p>
<p>Use of sick leave days for personal necessity reasons shall not be<br/>approved for purposes of personal convenience, participation in work<br/>stoppage or slowdown, or sick-out, or for the extension of a holiday,<br/>weekend, or vacation period, recreational activities. Association<br/>activities, or other activities which can be taken care of outside of work<br/>hours. The unit member shall verify in writing on the District form that<br/>personal necessity leave was utilized for one of the above listed<br/>reasons.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid Personal or Family Business Leave</p>
<p>Up to three days of paid sick leave may be used for personal or family<br/>business which cannot be conducted outside of the regular school<br/>day, provided that the unit member certifies that the paid personal or<br/>family business leave day shall not be used for the purposes of<br/>participation in work stoppage, slowdown, or sick-out. A unit<br/>member must notify the District in writing one week in advance of the<br/>intent to use the personal or family business leave day drawn upon<br/>the unit member's sick leave, except that when such leave is used for<br/>bereavement of a family member who is not in the immediate family,<br/>a full week's advance notice is not required. Upon return, the unit<br/>member shall verify that the leave was used in accordance with the<br/>purposes of this Article.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>A unit member shall be entitled to three (3) days paid leave of<br/>absence, or up to five (5) days if travel of more than 400 miles each<br/>way is involved, on account of the death of a member of the unit<br/>member's immediate family as defined above. No deduction shall be<br/>made from salary or accrued sick leave on account of use of such<br/>authorized leave of absence. Upon expiration of authorized<br/>bereavement leave, the unit member may utilize personal necessity<br/>leave for purposes of bereavement as provided elsewhere in this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service as a Witness or Juror</p>
<p>For time spent in court as a witness under subpoena to attend a civil<br/>proceeding as a witness in a matter regarding an event or transaction<br/>the employee perceived or investigated in the course of his or her<br/>duties, there shall be no deductions from pay. A unit member who is<br/>subpoenaed in such a matter must notify the site administrator and<br/>the Personnel Office immediately, so the District can seek<br/>reimbursement from the party who issued the subpoena. Any witness<br/>fees, excluding mileage, shall be submitted to the District in return<br/>for the employee's full salary.</p>
<p>There shall be no deductions from pay for the absence of certificated<br/>employees for jury duty. The Governing Board however recognizes<br/>that it is less disruptive to instruction when teachers are present as<br/>much as possible throughout the regular school year. Therefore, if<br/>certificated employees are willing and able to defer or postpone their<br/>jury service until the District's scheduled summer vacation.<br/>Thanksgiving, Winter or Spring break such employees will be paid for<br/>their jury service. The amount of compensation will be the long term<br/>substitute teacher rate in effect on the first day of actual jury service.</p>
<p>Certificated employees shall not be disciplined, discriminated against,<br/>or retaliated against for their inability or unwillingness to defer their<br/>jury service until summer vacation.</p>
<p>Should the actual jury service continue from the break period onto a<br/>regular work day for the unit member, the daily compensation shall<br/>not apply.</p>
<p>The District will implement procedures for the verification on the<br/>initial jury duty summons, request for deferral, granting of deferral<br/>and actual days of jury duty served.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Without Pav</p>
<p>A permanent unit member may request an unpaid leave of absence<br/>for a period not in excess of one year for any reason not specified<br/>elsewhere in this Agreement provided the following requirements are<br/>met.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substitute or temporary employee meeting District standards<br/>can be obtained.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application, including the reason for the request, for said<br/>leave shall be submitted by February 15 of the year prior to the<br/>leave.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall indicate to the unit member by April 1 if the<br/>leave request has been granted or denied.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall receive no fringe benefits nor accrue<br/>other rights during the unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leave must be in the best interests of the District's<br/>instructional program.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority shall be considered if only one leave is granted and<br/>more than one unit member applies.</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave shall not be granted for the purpose of accepting other<br/>employment.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned dates do not preclude the granting of an unpaid<br/>leave request for an applicant making such request after February 15.</p>
<p>Unit members returning from leave shall confirm in writing their<br/>intent to return upon conclusion of leave no later than March 15 of<br/>the year of the leave.</p>
<p>A permanent unit member may request a partial leave of absence for<br/>up to 80% of the days in a school year, following the deadlines and<br/>terms listed above. Partial leaves of absences may be renewed at the<br/>sole discretion of the District, when the request for renewal of the<br/>partial leave is submitted according to the deadlines and terms listed<br/>above.</p>
<p>I. Differential Pav Leave</p>
<p>When a unit member is absent from duty on account of illness or<br/>accident for a period of five (5) full months or less, the amount<br/>deducted from the salary due for any month in which the absence<br/>occurs shall not exceed the then current rate of pay for the short<br/>term or long term substitutes, employed to replace the unit member,<br/>exclusive of the rate for a &quot;super substitute&quot; (defined as a unit<br/>member on a re-employment list who is entitled to receive his or her<br/>regular rate of pay), or, if no substitute was employed, the amount<br/>which would have been paid to a substitute had a substitute been</p>
<p>employed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this article only, a school month is defined<br/>as twenty (20) days on which a unit member is required to work.</p>
<p>The five (5) months shall begin to run on the first day of absence<br/>following the exhaustion of the current school year's sick leave. The<br/>five (5) month period shall run consecutively with all accrued but<br/>unused sick leave from previous years. An employee shall not be<br/>provided more than one five-month period per illness or accident. If<br/>the illness or accident continues into a new school year, the</p>
<p>employee, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while ill or injured, may use up to the balance of the five-<br/>month period.</p>
<p>Use of extended illness leave and return there from is subject to the<br/>physician verification provisions of this Article and Board policy.</p>
<p>When a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave, including<br/>accumulated sick leave, and the member is unable to resume the<br/>duties of his/her position and continues to be absent due to illness or</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>accident beyond the five-month period, the employee, if not placed in<br/>another position, shall be placed on the reemployment list for a<br/>period of twenty-four (24) months, if probationary, or thirty-nine (39)<br/>months, if permanent. When the employee, during the twenty-four<br/>(24) or thirty-nine (39) month period provides a physician's<br/>confirmation and release to do the essential functions of a position for<br/>which he/she is credentialed and qualified, the employee shall be<br/>placed in such a position.</p>
<p>J. Job Sharing</p>
<p>The Etiwanda School District and the Etiwanda Teacher's Association<br/>agree to the following procedure for job share programs. This<br/>arrangement shall not be subject to the contractual grievance<br/>procedure.</p>

<p>Shared teaching assignments will be filled only by eligible unit<br/>members who have jointly agreed to work together and who<br/>have submitted a written proposal for shared teaching to the<br/>Superintendent or designee. The proposal must be received on<br/>or before February 15 of each school year prior to the year in<br/>which the shared teaching assignment will be requested. The<br/>proposal may be submitted simultaneously with the request for<br/>a year of unpaid leave, and neither request will prejudice the<br/>other. If one request is denied, the other will still be<br/>considered. Both unit members will be informed of the status<br/>of their proposal by April 1.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both unit members are required to work the five (5) pre,<br/>post, and mid-service days required of full-time<br/>teachers, plus regularly scheduled parent conferences,<br/>back to school night, and open house on the dates<br/>established by the District. Other responsibilities<br/>associated with the teaching assignment which occur<br/>outside of the regular workday will be divided by the two<br/>teachers, subject to the approval of the principal.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both members of the team will be responsible for<br/>sharing all information pertaining to their mutual<br/>assignment, including information from staff meetings<br/>and in-services.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both unit members must meet with the principal prior to<br/>June 1 to review the responsibilities of the assignment,<br/>and again prior to the opening of school to establish the<br/>exact working days and receive directions regarding<br/>attendance at staff and team meetings. The working<br/>calendar must be approved by the principal prior to the<br/>opening of school.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Schedule, Placement and Credit:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both unit members will receive an amount proportionate<br/>to their annual salary equivalent to the percentage of the<br/>job share.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 2013 both unit members will receive<br/>credit towards step advancement on the salary schedule<br/>in the amount proportionate to their annual work year<br/>calendar equivalent to the percentage of the job share.<br/>Once the combined percentages of job shares reaches<br/>one hundred percent (100%) of a work year the unit<br/>member will be able to advance to the next step on the<br/>salary schedule. Step advancement for partial work<br/>years must be completed within 5 years.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement:</p>
<p>Both unit members will receive an amount proportionate to the</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenure:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who has previously attained tenure in the<br/>District, who resigned his/her position in good standing,<br/>and subsequent to the resignation, is rehired as part of a<br/>shared teaching assignment less than 39 months after<br/>his or her resignation, and will be considered a<br/>permanent unit member with a new seniority date of the<br/>first date of service in the shared teaching assignment.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who has previously received tenure in the<br/>district, who resigned his/her position in good standing,<br/>and subsequent to the resignation, is rehired as part of a<br/>shared teaching assignment more than 39 months after<br/>his or her resignation, will be considered a probationary<br/>employee, with a new seniority date of the first date of<br/>service in the shared teaching assignment. To achieve<br/>permanent status, the unit member must actually work<br/>at least 75% of the school days in two consecutive<br/>years. The unit member will remain in probationary<br/>status until this requirement is met.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health and Welfare benefits and Leave:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member in the shared teaching assignment is<br/>entitled to an amount proportionate to the total current<br/>benefits package equivalent to the percentage of the job<br/>share.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave provisions shall be prorated.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewal:</p>
<p>The District reserves the right to review the effectiveness of the<br/>positions and to determine whether or not to continue them on<br/>a year-to-year basis. A unit member on a shared teaching<br/>assignment must notify the District by February 15 if he or she<br/>wishes to reapply for a similar shared teaching assignment of<br/>the upcoming school year.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria:</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The needs and efficient operation of the District.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member certification and competency.</p>
<p>K. Sick Leave Bank</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Donation on a case-by-case basis where the<br/>District and the Association mutually agree: Any bargaining unit<br/>member may irrevocably donate up to two (2) earned and unused<br/>days of sick leave to another bargaining unit member who has<br/>suffered a long-term or catastrophic illness and who has fully<br/>exhausted all paid leaves, including difference pay and any income<br/>derived from an income protection plan. Catastrophic leave donations<br/>shall not apply to employees whose absence originated as an<br/>industrial illness or accident.</p>
<p>This provision shall apply to a maximum of four (4) bargaining unit<br/>members annually. No bargaining unit member may receive more<br/>than twenty-two (22) days annually of donated sick leave.</p>
<p>Once donated, the donation becomes irrevocable, even if the donation<br/>is not utilized. It shall be the responsibility of the Etiwanda Teachers'<br/>Association to communicate these provisions to bargaining unit<br/>members and communicate requests for implementation to the<br/>district. The District will prepare and process related sick leave<br/>accounting documents.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>The Board's philosophy is indicated in Board Policy 6151.</p>
<p>It is the philosophy of the Etiwanda School District to maintain<br/>classroom sizes at the lowest reasonable level in order to provide<br/>optimum opportunities for growth of our children. Although this is<br/>the philosophy of this school district, it is recognized that there are<br/>situations beyond the control of the Board of Trustees to maintain<br/>such reasonable levels at all times. In the event of explosive growth<br/>of the community, facilities and personnel may not be procured<br/>rapidly enough to alleviate such high classroom levels in a short span<br/>of time. In such a situation, the Board of Trustees will act with<br/>reasonable speed to provide additional facilities and personnel in<br/>order to relieve such conditions which may exist beyond those levels<br/>established by the Education Code of the State of California.</p>
<p>A. Commencing with the 2014-15 school year, the district will provide<br/>each transitional kindergarten classroom and each kindergarten<br/>classroom with an enrollment exceeding 24 students with 3 hours,<br/>per student day, of instructional aide support.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>Commencing with the 2014-15 school year, the district will provide<br/>each &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transitional&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindergarten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindergarten</p>
<p>classroom with an enrollment exceeding 14 students and up to 24<br/>students with 1 and Vi hours, per student day, of instructional aide<br/>support.</p>
<p>Commencing with the 2014-15 school year, the district will provide<br/>each &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transitional&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindergarten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindergarten</p>
<p>classroom which does not receive 100 minutes of reciprocal teacher<br/>support with 3 hours, per student day, of instructional aide support.</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed that in the case of holidays; parent<br/>teacher conferences, teacher absence from the school site, in-service<br/>or minimum day preceding break periods, scheduled testing days,<br/>and absence of the assigned instructional aide that the regularly<br/>scheduled instructional support time missed will not be made up and<br/>is not a violation of this provision.</p>
<p>The schedule for the instructional support time will be developed with<br/>input from the teacher(s) with whom the aide will work. The principal<br/>shall have final approval of the schedule.</p>
<p>In the event that the Etiwanda school district should opt to suffer the<br/>penalties for classroom levels beyond the state established maximum<br/>rather than move toward procuring the needed additional facilities<br/>and personnel, the right of the Etiwanda Teachers Association to bring<br/>the matter before the Board of Trustees as a matter for discussion is<br/>established.</p>
<p>B. Additional Instructional Support for SDC Teachers.</p>
<p>When enrollment in an SDC class reaches 17 students, the SDC<br/>Teacher may request an additional 3 hour instructional aide.<br/>Once requested, the district shall make every effort to<br/>accommodate this request within 20 school days. If the district<br/>does not satisfy this request within 20 school days, a half day<br/>sub will be provided until the position is filled.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition</p>
<p>A transfer is defined as a change in work location (school, office, or</p>
<p>one District site to another) by a unit member.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Initiated Requests: Criteria for Transfer</p>
<p>The following criteria shall be used in consideration of transfer</p>
<p>requests:</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution the unit member can make in the new<br/>position.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifications and experience of the unit member<br/>compared to needs of the position to be filled and the position<br/>to be vacated.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the service rendered to the District by the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preference of the unit member.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee certification authorization.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member's seniority in the District.</p>
