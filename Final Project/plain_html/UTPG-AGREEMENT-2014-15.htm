<p>4</p>
<p>3. Association Rights</p>
<p>Association staff and Association representatives shall have the right of access to bargaining unit<br/>members during times when such employees are not engaged or required to be engaged in performing<br/>assigned duties.</p>

Deductions for members who<br/>submit an authorization or a revised authorization after the commencement of the school year<br/>shall be appropriately prorated to complete the payments authorized by the authorization card<br/>within the above-mentioned ten-month period.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member who is not a member of the United Teaching Profession-<br/>Goleta/CTA/NEA, or who does not make application for membership within thirty (30) days from<br/>the date of commencement of assigned duties, shall become a member of the Association or pay<br/>the Association a fair share service fee.

<p>Maintenance of Membership - Individual unit members who are Association members as of<br/>October 1 of any given year may not drop membership in the Association until August 31 of the<br/>following year.</p>
<p>5. Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>Grievance Definitions</p>

<p>Association - Association means the association elected as the exclusive representative or designee<br/>thereof.</p>
<p>Claim - The assertion of a grievance by one or more members of the unit, and/or the Association.<br/>Individual Grievances</p>
<p>Any member of the unit may at any time present grievances to the District and have such grievances<br/>resolved without the intervention of the Association as long as the resolution is reached prior to Level<br/>II and the resolution is not inconsistent with the terms of this contract; provided that the District shall<br/>not agree to a final resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the<br/>grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>Informal Meeting</p>
<p>Any unit member(s) or the Association alleging a claim shall make every effort to meet with the<br/>principal or other administrator against whom the claim is alleged, with the objective of resolving the<br/>matter informally. The unit member(s) may have a representative present with him/her at this<br/>informal meeting.</p>
<p>Level I - School Principal/Appropriate Administrator</p>
<p>In the event the claim is not resolved at an informal meeting, the aggrieved may submit the claim as a<br/>formal written grievance to the principal or appropriate administrator. Any such written grievance</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>must be submitted within fifteen (15) days following an informal meeting or thirty (30) days following<br/>the incident giving rise to the claim, whichever occurs later. If the aggrieved has not submitted a<br/>written grievance within this time period, the claim will be deemed to have been resolved.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after receipt of a written grievance by the principal/appropriate administrator,<br/>she/he shall meet with the aggrieved and representative(s) in an effort to resolve the matter. Within<br/>ten (10) days after the date of the Level I meeting, the administrator shall render a written decision to<br/>the aggrieved and shall transmit a copy to the Association. If the Administrator does not respond<br/>within the time limits, the aggrieved may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>Level II - Superintendent or Designee</p>
<p>If the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level I, or if no decision is<br/>rendered within the designated time period, the aggrieved, through his/her representative, may<br/>forward the written grievance to the Superintendent within ten (10) days after the decision at Level I<br/>or twenty (20) days after the grievance was presented, whichever is later.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after receipt of the written grievance by the Superintendent, the Superintendent<br/>or his/her designee shall meet with the aggrieved and representative(s) in an effort to resolve the<br/>matter. Within ten (10) days after the date of the Level II meeting, the Superintendent shall render a<br/>written decision to the aggrieved and shall transmit a copy to the Association. If the Administrator does<br/>not respond within the time limits, the aggrieved may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>Level III - Mediation</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after receipt of the Superintendent or his/her designee's written decision from<br/>Level II, or the time limit expires without the issuance of the Superintendent or his/her designee's<br/>written decision, the aggrieved may submit the grievance to mediation with a mediator designated by<br/>the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). A copy of the request for assignment of a mediator<br/>shall be provided to the District.</p>
<p>The mediation meeting(s) shall be scheduled at the convenience of the mediator. If an agreement is<br/>reached at mediation, the agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed by the aggrieved,<br/>the Association and the District. This agreement shall be non-precedential and shall constitute a<br/>settlement of the grievance.</p>
<p>If the aggrieved, the Association and the Superintendent or her/his designee have not resolved the<br/>grievance with the assistance of the mediator, the Association may proceed to Level IV.</p>
<p>Level IV - Arbitration</p>
<p>If the grievance is not resolved at Level III, Mediation, the aggrieved may submit the grievance to the<br/>Association, and the Association will determine whether the matter may go to Level IV. If the<br/>Association determines to pursue the grievance to Level IV, it must so notify the Superintendent within<br/>twenty (20) days after the date of the last mediation meeting. Upon receipt of the request for<br/>arbitration, the parties shall have five (5) days in which to agree upon an arbitrator. If the parties fail to<br/>agree, the District shall request a list of five (5) arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>An arbitrator shall be selected by the following procedure: A representative of the Association and the<br/>District's representative shall select the arbitrator from the American Association in the manner<br/>prescribed by that organization.</p>
<p>Arbitration Hearing</p>
<p>No party in interest shall be permitted to assert any grounds in evidence before the arbitrator which<br/>was not previously disclosed to the other party. The arbitrator shall consider only those issues raised<br/>by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>The arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such financial reimbursements or other remedies<br/>as judged to be proper. Each party shall bear the full costs for its representation in the arbitration. The<br/>cost of the arbitration shall be divided equally between the District and the Association.</p>
<p>A certificated court reporter may be used to record the arbitration hearing. The Association and<br/>District may share equally the cost of the court reporter. If any party requests a transcript of the<br/>proceedings, that party shall bear the full costs for that transcript. If the parties mutually request a<br/>transcript, the total cost of the transcripts shall be divided equally between the District and the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>Once the arbitrator has been selected, hearings shall commence at the convenience of the arbitrator.<br/>The arbitrator shall conduct the hearings in accordance with the voluntary arbitration rules of the<br/>American Arbitration Association and the provisions of this Article. The jurisdiction of the arbitrator<br/>shall be confined to a determination of the facts and the interpretation of the provisions of the Article.<br/>The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this Agreement or<br/>the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures of the District. Witnesses will be assured that<br/>their testimony will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>Within thirty (30) days after conclusion of the hearings, the arbitrator shall render a written decision<br/>which shall be binding upon the parties.</p>
<p>General Provisions</p>
<p>Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the number of days indicated<br/>at each level should be considered as a maximum, and every effort should be made to expedite the<br/>process. The time specified, however, may be extended by mutual written consent.</p>
<p>In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all the levels in this<br/>grievance procedure by the end of the school year, the time limits set forth herein may be reduced so<br/>that the grievance procedure may be completed prior to the end of the school year, or as soon<br/>thereafter as is practicable.</p>
<p>The aggrieved may change the designation of the representative(s) at any level during the grievance<br/>process. Such change shall be communicated in writing to all parties in interest.</p>
<p>Aggrieved members of the unit not under the supervision of a principal should submit their claim to<br/>the appropriate administrator for processing at Level I.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The parties in interest agree to make available to each other all pertinent, non-confidential information<br/>not privileged under law or Board policies in their possession or control and which is relevant to the<br/>issues raised by the grievance. Copies of all non-confidential written opinions and decisions shall be<br/>made available to the grievant.</p>
<p>No grievance shall be valid unless it shall have been presented at the appropriate level within twenty<br/>(20) days after the aggrieved knew of the act or condition and its aggrieving nature that formed the<br/>basis of the grievance, and if not so presented, the grievance will be considered waived.</p>
<p>A decision rendered at any level shall be considered final unless an appeal to the next step within this<br/>Article is registered within the time limit specified. If a decision is not given to the aggrieved within the<br/>time limit, an appeal may be taken to the next level.</p>
<p>No party in interest shall take reprisals against any member of the Association, party in interest,<br/>Association representative, management person, or any other participant in the grievance procedure<br/>by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>Any record(s) pertaining to a grievance shall be kept in a grievance file separate from the aggrieved's<br/>official District personnel file.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>The District shall maintain an average class size of twenty-four (24) students in grades 4-6 and an<br/>average class size of twenty-four (24) in grades K-3. TK shall not exceed twenty (20) students per class<br/>until all TK classes are enrolled at twenty (20) students. The District reserves the right to provide<br/>additional personnel units to reduce class size to meet a specific school or program need.</p>
<p>When a class exceeds twenty-eight (28) students, grades 4-6, or twenty-five (25) students, grades TK-3,<br/>for longer than ten (10) consecutive school days the District shall provide an additional hour of daily<br/>instructional classroom support per student above twenty-five (25) in grades K-3 or twenty-eight (28)<br/>in grades 4-6. At initial class placement, combination classes shall be equal to or less than other classes<br/>at the grade level except with third/fourth combination classes. Exception 1: having enough students<br/>to support an effective combination class. Exception 2: when it would incur additional cost to the<br/>district. Midyear decreases in straight grade class numbers will not trigger movement of students from<br/>the combination class.</p>
<p>The process for annual placement of special education students in general education education classes<br/>shall be based on IEP goals and the best interest of that student. Annual rotation and staff preferences<br/>among teachers at the grade level will be considered for classroom placement. Placement meetings<br/>shall be held at each site and will be comprised of a committee, which must include representation of<br/>the general education teaching staff.</p>
<p>The District shall provide justification of placement upon request. Only the process shall be grieved.</p>
<p>In balancing annual class sizes during initial placement of students into classes, general education<br/>teachers with special education students who are not reflected on the general education teacher's<br/>class roster shall have class sizes that are equal to or less than other classes at the grade level.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>7. Duty Hours, Responsibilities and Working Conditions</p>
<p>Duty Hours and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Because unit members render a professional service, it is not possible to designate in advance the<br/>amount of time unit members need for planning and preparation; however, minimum duty hours will<br/>be as follows: Unit members shall be on campus and responsible for instructional and other assigned<br/>duties fifteen (15) minutes before the start of the student day. They will remain on duty for a<br/>reasonable amount of time to accomplish their professional duties. Teachers in assignments with<br/>pupils who are normally dismissed earlier than the general student population (e.g. kindergarten and<br/>transitional kindergarten) will normally be at their assigned sites at least until dismissal of the general<br/>student population. Included within these daily minimum duty hours shall be the number of<br/>instructional minutes in the District schedule (Appendix A) which will enable the District to comply with<br/>Education Code Sections 46201 and 37202, as such code sections are currently written or may be<br/>amended during the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>As part of the professional day, unit members are responsible for other instructional day duties that<br/>include program development, professional growth activities, parent conferences, faculty and District<br/>meetings, special help to student(s), and other assignments that are determined by management to be<br/>necessary for the efficient operation of the District. No inservice or other District meeting scheduled on<br/>Saturday or Sunday may be required of unit members.</p>
<p>Unit members shall be required to attend and participate in no more than four after-duty hour<br/>functions per school year. After-duty functions are defined as functions that are not contiguous with<br/>the end of the professional day.</p>
<p>These meetings shall be as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent Information Night</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open House</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than two meetings or functions to be mutually agreed upon by the unit member and<br/>principal. Examples include, but are not limited to: Sixth Grade Graduation, Family Nights, Fairs,<br/>Education Nights, Performances, PTA Meetings, and others approved by the site administrator.</p>
<p>The principal and the unit member shall tentatively delineate the after-duty hour responsibilities of the<br/>unit member during the annual goal-setting conference which are subject to change by mutual consent<br/>of the unit member and principal should other priorities arise. If a situation arises wherein the principal<br/>and teacher are not in agreement, the principal and teacher shall each select one function.</p>
<p>All unit members shall be entitled to an uninterrupted duty-free lunch period of thirty (30) minutes.<br/>Normally, unit members shall be entitled to the same number of minutes that students have for lunch,<br/>but if an unforeseen need arises after the thirty-minute, duty-free period, unit members may be<br/>assigned to duty. Members may elect but are not required to schedule meetings during any portion of<br/>the 45-minute lunch period.</p>
<p>The District will employ playground supervisors to relieve classroom teachers of recess yard duty,</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>subject to the availability of individuals to fill these positions.</p>
<p>The work year shall consist of 180 instructional days, 2 staff days, and 3 Staff Development Days.</p>
<p>Nurses shall have the right and opportunity to receive inservice education as deemed appropriate for<br/>their changing roles and responsibilities, and may request release time up to four days a year for such<br/>training.</p>
<p>Unit members shall have the equivalent of one full day for preparation in the absence of unusual<br/>circumstances during the two workdays prior to the opening of school. Unit members shall be paid at<br/>full salary per diem for any inservice days required by the District beyond the 185-day contract year.<br/>This does not preclude the District from providing compensation in a lesser amount to unit members<br/>who voluntarily participate in inservice activities beyond the 185-day work year, nor does it require the<br/>payment of compensation for such voluntary participation.</p>
<p>One faculty or district meeting may be scheduled for all faculty per week. Such meetings shall be<br/>adjourned by 4:30 p.m. except on Thursday that will be adjourned no later than 4:00. Thursday<br/>meetings will be limited to one district-wide meeting a month. All meetings will be publicized no later<br/>than 9:00 a.m. the day before, except in a situation that may occur which could not reasonably have<br/>been anticipated. Site faculty meetings or district inservices shall not be held the week preceding the<br/>issuance of report cards.</p>
<p>Parent Conferences</p>
<p>All schools shall have five (5) consecutive school minimum days to be used in the fall for parent<br/>conferencing or reporting purposes. Four (4) additional minimum days shall also be provided in the<br/>spring. Two minimum days may be scheduled for the purpose of staff development and/or training.<br/>Student dismissal on minimum days for spring parent conferences will be no later than 1:30 p.m. The<br/>District shall determine the dates of these days.</p>
<p>Change of Classroom</p>
<p>Any classroom teacher who has to change classrooms during the 185-day teacher work year shall be<br/>granted the choice of:</p>
<p>two days of release time to implement the move, or</p>
<p>the equivalent of two days of substitute teacher's pay, or</p>
<p>one day of release time and the equivalent of one day of substitute pay.</p>
<p>Any non-classroom teacher who has to change rooms during the 185-day teacher work year shall be<br/>granted the choice of:</p>
<p>one day of release time to implement the move, or</p>
<p>the equivalent of one day of substitute teacher's pay.</p>
<p>Any classroom teacher who involuntarily has to change classrooms outside the 185-day teacher work<br/>year shall be paid the equivalent of two days' substitute teacher's pay. No teacher shall be required to</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>use any portion of the 185-day teacher work year to accomplish the move for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>The District shall provide release time at the rate of up to two days per FTE per school year for each<br/>special day class teacher and resource specialist for the purpose of completing Individualized Education<br/>Plans and conferences. Requests for such release time shall be made in advance to the principal and<br/>are subject to availability of substitute teachers. Release time will be provided for classroom teachers<br/>of full inclusion students to attend one parent-team meeting per month. Members may elect, but are<br/>not required, to take the release time.</p>
<p>Children of Employees</p>
<p>For the purposes of student attendance, certificated employees, if they so desire, will be considered<br/>residents of the attendance area in which they work. As a result, their children shall attend the school<br/>to which the employee is assigned unless it triggers a combination class. Once a transfer has been<br/>granted the District cannot rescind the transfer in subsequent years. If an older sibling is currently<br/>enrolled at the site, any younger siblings will be granted a transfer unless it triggers a combination<br/>class. If enrollment projections prevent the admittance of the employee's child, an alternate site will<br/>be offered until an opening occurs. In the event of multiple employees having new students entering<br/>the same site where not all new students can be accepted due to a combination class being triggered,<br/>a lottery will be held to determine which family is granted transfer.</p>
<p>Extra Service</p>
<p>Principal Designee</p>

Special Services personnel assigned to more than one school site will<br/>be evaluated by the Assistant Superintendent of Pupil Personnel and Special Services, or an<br/>administrative designee with input from principals of each school of assignment.</p>
<p>4. Prior to November 1 of each year, the evaluator shall meet with each employee for whom he or<br/>she has evaluation responsibility for that year for the purpose of establishing the employee's<br/>goals, objectives, and assessment methods. The evaluator and the employee shall attempt to<br/>agree mutually upon the goals, objectives, and assessment methods that will be used in the<br/>evaluation process. In the event that agreement cannot be reached on these items, the employee<br/>may attach a written statement to the decision of the evaluator, which will remain a part of the<br/>evaluation record.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to November 1 of each non-evaluation year, each unit member shall meet with his/her<br/>evaluator to establish goals and objectives for the year, requirements for achieving such<br/>objectives, and other concerns as appropriate.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers receiving an informal or formal observation must be given written feedback within<br/>two working days of an informal observation and five working days of a formal observation.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee who does not have permanent status shall be evaluated by the District no less<br/>often than once each year; each unit member with permanent status shall be evaluated no less<br/>often than once every two (2) years, subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 of this Article.<br/>Preschool teachers will be evaluated no less than once a year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation conducted pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall be put in writing and a<br/>copy shall be transmitted to the unit member not later than April 30 of the school year in which<br/>the evaluation takes place. The unit member shall have the right to attach a response to the<br/>evaluation, which shall become a permanent attachment to his/her personnel file.

In addition, at any time<br/>during the school year the District may notify an employee in writing that his/her job<br/>performance is unsatisfactory or that it needs improvement. In this event, the District and the<br/>employee shall meet as necessary to discuss specific recommendations for improvement of the<br/>employee's performance. The District may require an employee who has received written notice<br/>of unsatisfactory performance or needed improvement to participate in a program designed to<br/>improve appropriate areas of the employee's performance and to further pupil achievement and<br/>the instructional objectives of the District.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>9. Transfer</p>
<p>Recognizing that reassignments/transfers can be both beneficial and/or required, the following<br/>procedures are established:</p>
<p>Reassignment Language</p>
<p>Reassignment is a change of grade level assignment at the same worksite.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever there is a vacancy at a school site the principal shall solicit volunteers and all teachers</p>
<p>at that site to fill those vacancies based on the following: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</p>
<p>Needs of the District and school site or its students</p>
<p>•Special skills and talents required by the assignment and needed by the school</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary reassignments shall be requested in writing. If the principal denies the reassignment,<br/>the principal shall reduce to writing the reasons for the denial, if requested.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary reassignments: In the event the principal has not received any written request to fill<br/>existing vacancies, the principal may reassign a teacher. This shall be considered an involuntary<br/>reassignment. Should an involuntary reassignment occur, the principal shall meet with the<br/>teacher to communicate the reasons for the reassignment. The reasons shall be placed in writing<br/>if requested by the teacher.</p>
<p>Involuntary reassignments shall not span more than three (3) grade levels unless it is done to<br/>avoid multiple involuntary reassignments.</p>
<p>Any teacher involuntarily reassigned classrooms shall be entitled to a District paid substitute<br/>teacher for two days to assist the teacher in accomplishing the reassignment and shall be assisted<br/>by the District in the movement of the teacher's materials and supplies.</p>
<p>Involuntary reassignments shall not be made arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>
<p>Any teacher involuntarily reassigned shall not be involuntarily reassigned again for a period of two<br/>school years unless all other options have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Once reassignments are made at the school site, the resulting vacancies will be posted by the first<br/>Monday in May.</p>
<p>Voluntary Transfer During the School Year</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a vacancy occurs following the fourth week of the school year, the Personnel<br/>Services Department shall post an announcement of the vacancy in each school and give a copy<br/>to the Association within five (5) working days of the notification of the vacancy. The notice shall<br/>contain a closing date for receipt of applications not less than five (5) working days after posting.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible after the posted closing date for receipt of applications for transfer, the<br/>Personnel Services Department shall send a list of all applicants to the principal of the school<br/>where the vacancy exists. No assignment to fill the vacancy shall be made until all applicants have<br/>had an opportunity to be interviewed.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as a decision is made regarding the existing vacancy, all applicants will be notified by the<br/>Personnel Services Department.</p>
<p>Upon request, the principal shall provide a letter to an applicant who was not selected providing<br/>feedback on the applicant's interview.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing shall preclude a qualified employee from applying simultaneously for more than one<br/>existing vacancy.</p>
<p>Voluntary Transfer for the Following School Year</p>
<p>In order to implement voluntary transfer for the following school year, the following procedure will be</p>
<p>used:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals will issue tentative grade level assignments by May 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the first Monday in May, the District will conduct three rounds of voluntary<br/>transfers. The first round will consist of no more than four days. Two rounds will follow and not<br/>exceed three days each. Between rounds, sites will have forty-eight hours to consider voluntary<br/>reassignments. For each round, the District will post all known vacancies and announce a<br/>deadline for unit members to contact the principal for an interview.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will not need to file an application form in order to be considered for transfer. All<br/>teachers will be eligible automatically to apply for vacancies.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the unit members who contact the principal by the deadline date shall be interviewed.<br/>Following the interviews all applicants will be notified by the Personnel Services Department.</p>
<p>Upon request, the principal shall provide a letter to an applicant who was not selected providing<br/>feedback on the applicant's interview.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a principal assignment changes following the beginning of the third round, an additional round<br/>of transfers will be scheduled either before the end of the school year if time permits. If time<br/>does not permit, the additional round of transfers will be completed within the five-day period<br/>before the first day of instruction.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing shall preclude a qualified employee from applying simultaneously for more than one<br/>existing vacancy.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member on leave who notifies the District by March 15 of his/her commitment to return<br/>for the following school year shall be permitted to participate in the voluntary transfer process as<br/>of the date of receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Involuntary Transfer</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an involuntary transfer is necessary as the result of declining enrollment or reduction of<br/>services at a particular school, such transfer shall be based on the seniority ranking of employees<br/>established by the District in accordance with the California Education Code, except where<br/>credential requirements and/or the special needs of the program warrant otherwise.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a unit member has been involuntarily transferred due to declining enrollment, school<br/>closure, or reduction of services, the District will make an effort not to subject that unit member</p>
<p>to a further involuntary transfer for the same reasons for four years following the date of the<br/>initial transfer.</p>
<p>Notice of involuntary transfer due to declining enrollment, school closure, or reduction of<br/>services, shall be given as early as possible. If two weeks' notice cannot be given, the District will<br/>grant the teacher two days of release time to prepare for the new assignment.</p>
<p>Procedures for involuntary transfer shall be posted at each school prior to any school closure.</p>
<p>A permanent unit member who is involuntarily transferred due to declining enrollment or<br/>reduction of services after the last day of a school year and before the first day of a new school<br/>year shall be given priority for placement over the most recently hired temporary teacher.</p>
<p>If an assignment of a unit member should result in a condition that is not in the best interest of<br/>the students and/or the education program in the school, the principal and unit member shall<br/>make every effort to correct the situation. If the condition is not corrected within a reasonable<br/>period of time, the principal and/or unit member may request the Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Administrative Services to attempt to locate a more suitable assignment for the unit member.<br/>Notice of involuntary transfer as described in this section shall be made by May 1.</p>
<p>In the case of two unit members each working part-time and sharing one full-time assignment,<br/>for the purpose of involuntary transfer they shall each be subject to reassignment based upon<br/>their individual District seniority ranking.</p>
<p>It is the intent that all transfers as set forth above must be in the best interests of the District.<br/>[California Education Code Section 35035(c)]</p>

<p>13.Leaves</p>
<p>All employees on an approved leave of absence, partial or full, must notify Personnel of their<br/>intentions to return or not to return by March 15.</p>
<p>Sick Leave</p>
<p>A unit member's absence from work due to illness or injury shall be designated as sick leave and shall<br/>be time lost with pay.</p>
<p>All unit members employed five (5) days a week in a position requiring certification qualifications shall<br/>be entitled to ten (10) days' leave of absence for illness or injury with full pay for a school year of<br/>service. Such sick leave may be used at any time during the school year.</p>
<p>A unit member employed for less than five (5) school days a week shall be entitled, for a school year of<br/>service, to that proportion of ten (10) days of leave of absence for illness or injury as the number of<br/>days s/he is employed bears to five (5). Such sick leave may be used at any time during the school year.</p>
<p>Unit members may accumulate unused sick leave without limitation. Unit members must contact the<br/>Personnel Services Department in advance of taking sick leave whenever possible in order that other<br/>arrangements may be made for the services needed.</p>
<p>All unit members who accept a position with the Goleta Union School District shall be given credit for<br/>all accumulated leave of absence for illness or injury accumulated with his/her previous California<br/>public school employer which s/he may be entitled to have transferred in accordance with the<br/>Education Code of the State of California.</p>
<p>If a unit member is terminated and has used more sick leave than was earned, the amount used but<br/>not earned shall be deducted from his/her final warrant.</p>
<p>Verification of Absence for Illness or Injury</p>
<p>In the event that the District has cause to believe that a unit member is abusing sick leave, the District<br/>may require said unit member to obtain verification from a doctor or practitioner for any leave taken<br/>after notice of such requirement is given. For absences caused by illness or injury which may impact<br/>upon the unit member's ability to perform his/her duties, the District may require a physician's<br/>clearance for the unit member to return to his/her assignment.</p>
<p>Quarantine Leave</p>
<p>A unit member shall be granted leave of absence without loss of pay or accumulated sick leave for<br/>absences due to being quarantined as a result of his/her contact with persons having a contagious<br/>disease while performing his/her duties.</p>
<p>Industrial Accident Leave</p>
<p>For purposes of this section, the term &quot;duty&quot; refers to all scheduled working days, including legal and<br/>board-declared holidays, on which a unit member is authorized to render service to the District.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>The term &quot;qualifying for worker's compensation&quot; presupposes that an accident report has been filed<br/>according to established procedure and that the District's worker's compensation insurance<br/>administrator considers the claim is valid. In the event of rejection of the claim by said carrier,<br/>industrial accident leave shall not apply.</p>
<p>Unit members who are absent from duty because of illness or injury resulting from industrial accident<br/>qualifying for worker's compensation are granted industrial accident leave under the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident leave applies from the first day of such absence from duty to and including the<br/>last day of such absence from duty, but not exceeding sixty working days in any fiscal year for the<br/>same industrial accident.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of salary paid to such unit member in any calendar month will be the salary s/he<br/>would have received had s/he not suffered the industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member is absent from duty for more than sixty working days as a result of such<br/>industrial accident leave, s/he shall then be entitled to the benefits provided by law and this<br/>section for accrued sick leave, extended sick leave, and advanced sick leave, respectively.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any days of absence from duty as a result of the same industrial accident, whether the unit<br/>member receives salary payments under industrial accident leave, other paid leave, or vacation,<br/>the unit member shall endorse to the District any wage loss benefit check from the District's<br/>worker's compensation insurance carrier which would make his/her total compensation from<br/>both sources exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the amount s/he would have received as<br/>salary had s/he not suffered the industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days of absence under industrial accident leave shall not be deducted from the unit member's<br/>sick leave accumulations, but the amount of industrial accident leave shall be reduced by one day<br/>for each day of such authorized absence from duty regardless of a compensation award.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an industrial accident absence beginning in one fiscal year extends into the next fiscal year, the<br/>unit member shall be entitled in the new fiscal year for the same accident or illness only to the<br/>amount of unused industrial accident leave remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the<br/>industrial accident occurred.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable industrial accident leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be eligible for industrial accident leave, the unit member, while absent from duty with<br/>the District, shall remain within the State of California unless prior approval is granted by the<br/>Board for travel outside the State.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is eligible for reemployment and has been medically released for return to<br/>his/her duties but fails to accept an appropriate assignment for which s/he is qualified shall be<br/>terminated or placed on health leave of absence.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be eligible for reemployment upon submission of a physician's statement<br/>that s/he is able to assume his/her duties, within a period of thirty-nine (39) months after the<br/>commencement of such industrial accident leave.</p>
<p>A unit member shall be entitled to a maximum of five (5) days of leave of absence without loss of<br/>salary for the death of any member of his/her immediate family.</p>
<p>The term &quot;immediate family&quot; is defined as mother, father, sister, brother, husband, wife, child, son-in-<br/>law, daughter-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandparent of the unit member or spouse,<br/>grandchild, mother-in-law, father-in-law, or any dependent relative or relative of a spouse living in the<br/>immediate household of the unit member.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave shall be limited to circumstances that are serious in nature and that the<br/>employee cannot reasonably be expected to disregard, and that necessitate immediate attention, or<br/>that cannot be taken care of after work hours or on weekends. It shall include but not be limited to the<br/>following:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illness of a member of the employee's immediate family;</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of a member of the immediate family. Personal necessity leave taken for this purpose shall<br/>be in addition to any bereavement leave allowable.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death of a close personal friend or a member of the employee's family not defined as an<br/>&quot;immediate member of the family&quot;;</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving the employee's property or the person or property of any member of the<br/>employee's immediate family;</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Court appearance as a litigant;</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency and/or reasons of compelling personal importance. Such leave will not be used for<br/>actions detrimental to the District.</p>
<p>Advance permission for absence under the provisions of this section shall be obtained by the employee<br/>from designated District management personnel except in cases where such absence is caused by the<br/>illness or death of a member of his/her immediate family or because of an accident involving his/her<br/>person or property, or the person or property of a member of his/her immediate family, or where<br/>there is an emergency situation of a personal nature where obtaining such permission is not feasible.</p>
<p>A full-time unit member may take up to ten (10) days of personal necessity leave as follows:</p>
<p>A full-time unit member may take up to seven (7) days without specifying the reason at the time<br/>of the request. The reason for the leave must fit the definition of personal necessity stated<br/>above.</p>
<p>A full-time unit member may take up to three (3) additional days of personal necessity and must<br/>state the specific reason for the absence at the time of the request. The supervisor must agree<br/>that the reason stated by the unit member fits the definition of personal necessity stated above.<br/>The unit member may state that the reason is &quot;compelling personal importance&quot; but must<br/>provide an explanation that allows the supervisor to judge the validity of the request.

<p>Personal necessity leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>All such personal necessity leave shall be charged to the unit member's accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>Family and Medical Leave</p>
<p>Under the Federal and State Family and Medical Leave Laws, a unit member may obtain up to twelve<br/>weeks of unpaid leave with paid medical benefits for any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of a child or to care for a newborn;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The placement of a child in connection with adoption or foster care;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave to care for a member's child, parent, or spouse who has a serious health condition;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave because of a serious health condition that makes a member unable to perform the<br/>functions of the position.</p>
<p>A unit member is eligible for leave if she/he:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been employed for at least twelve months; and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been employed for at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month period immediately<br/>preceding the beginning of the leave.</p>
<p>Full-time certificated employees are deemed to have met the 1,250-hour test if they have been<br/>employed for a full school year immediately preceding the beginning of the leave.</p>
<p>The duration of the leave is up to twelve workweeks during any twelve-month period. If both spouses<br/>are employed by the District, leave connected with childbirth or adoption or foster care is limited to an<br/>aggregate of twelve workweeks for both employees.</p>
<p>Call the Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services to discuss the particulars and complete any<br/>necessary documentation.</p>
<p>Rights To Reinstatement and Maintenance of Benefits</p>
<p>Upon granting an employee's request for Family and Medical leave, the Superintendent or designee<br/>shall guarantee to reinstate the employee in the same or a comparable position when the leave ends.<br/>(29 USC 2614; Government Code 12945.2)</p>
<p>The district may refuse to reinstate an employee returning from leave to the same or a comparable<br/>position if all of the following apply: (29 USC 2614; Government Code 12945.2)</p>
<p>1. The employee is a salaried &quot;key employee&quot; who is among the highest paid 10 percent of those</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>district employees who are employed within 75 miles of the employee's worksite.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refusal is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to district operations.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district informs the employee of its intent to refuse reinstatement at the time it determines that<br/>the refusal is necessary, and the employee fails to immediately return to service.</p>
<p>Intermittent Leave/ Reduced Leave Schedule</p>
<p>Leave related to the serious health condition of the employee or his/her child, parent, spouse, or<br/>registered domestic partner may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when<br/>medically necessary, as determined by the health care provider of the person with the serious medical<br/>condition. (29 USC 2612; 2 CCR 7297.3)</p>
<p>If an employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule that is foreseeable based<br/>on planned medical treatment for the employee or family member, the district may require the<br/>employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position. This alternative position must<br/>have equivalent pay and benefits, the employee must be qualified for the position, and the position<br/>must better accommodate recurring periods of leave that the employee's regular job. Transfer to an<br/>alternative position may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's need<br/>for intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule. (29 USC 2612; 2 CCR 7297.3)</p>
<p>(cf. 4113.4/4213.4/4313.4 - Temporary Modified/Light-Duty Assignment)</p>
<p>Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank</p>
<p>The Association and the District establish a catastrophic sick leave bank with the following provisions:</p>
<p>Definition: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illness or injury is defined as an illness or injury that is expected to</p>
<p>incapacitate a unit member for at least ten (10) working days and incapacitate the unit member<br/>beyond the exhaustion of accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>Membership and Contributions: Unit members may voluntarily become members of the bank by<br/>making a contribution of accrued sick leave under the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial contributions are made in writing.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions are irrevocable once a unit member has become a member of the bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions may be made only from a unit member's accrued sick leave and shall be deducted<br/>from said leave balance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions may be made only between September 1 and September 30 of any given year,<br/>except for unit members returning from leave who may contribute to the bank within ten (10)<br/>calendar days of return from leave, and new employees who may contribute within thirty (30)<br/>calendar days of employment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution in the first year of membership is one day. Members may continue membership<br/>in succeeding years by contributing one-half day if the Association deems it necessary. The<br/>minimum unit of contribution shall be one-halfday.</p>
<p>6. On September 1 of each year, the Association will determine whether additional contributions<br/>are required to replenish the bank. When the total reserves of the bank fall below 100 days, the<br/>Association will notify members that an additional 14 day will be deducted from their accrued sick<br/>leave. If a member does NOT wish the 14 day deduction from her or his sick leave, s/he must<br/>notify the District in writing and in so doing withdraw from the membership in the bank. Any<br/>previous contributions the unit has made in previous years remain in the bank.</p>
<p>Committee: The Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank Committee, composed of three Association members,<br/>shall be responsible for considering requests from members for grants of catastrophic sick leave. The<br/>Committee shall notify the Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services in writing of its decision.<br/>All matters before the Committee shall be kept confidential.</p>
<p>Grants: The Committee may grant approval of a catastrophic sick leave grant to a unit member under<br/>the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is a member of the bank and submits a request in writing.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has exhausted all accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member's illness or injury conforms to the definition of catastrophic illness or injury set<br/>forth in this section and the individual's condition is verified by a physician's written statement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member's inability to work is acknowledged by the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum of four grants of ten (10) workdays each may be permitted for one individual per<br/>school year.</p>
<p>6 Requests will be considered and acted upon on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>The District shall deduct one day from the bank for every day used by a member.</p>
<p>The total amount that may be drawn from the bank by the entire bargaining unit in any one school<br/>year may not exceed one hundred (100) days or the balance in the bank, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p>The bank shall carry its balance from year to year.</p>
<p>The Association shall hold the District harmless in all matters pertaining to the Catastrophic Sick Leave<br/>Bank and agrees to pay to the District all legal fees and legal costs incurred by the District in defending<br/>any actions brought against the District in these matters.</p>
<p>Leaves for Judicial and Official Appearances</p>
<p>The District shall grant leaves of absences to unit members to appear as a witness in court other than<br/>as a litigant or to respond to an official order from another governmental jurisdiction for reasons not<br/>brought about through the connivance or misconduct of the unit member.</p>
<p>The District shall grant leaves of absence to unit members regularly called for jury duty in the manner<br/>provided for by law.</p>
<p>The District shall grant such leaves of absence with pay. The unit member shall promptly reimburse the<br/>District for any jury or witness fees received.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Job-Sharing</p>
<p>Classroom teachers may be able to share an assignment with another classroom teacher. A teacher<br/>would need to apply for a part-time leave of absence and meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request would be to reduce the assignment from full-time to part-time;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two individuals would have to work out a joint proposal regarding the one position that the<br/>two would share;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two individuals developing the proposal would have to be in permanent or probationary<br/>status the year in which they apply;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request would need to be accompanied by a statement from a principal that s/he would<br/>incorporate the shared assignment on his/her staff; and</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to the job-sharing arrangement.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job-sharing process must be completed with Personnel by March 15. Exceptions due to<br/>unforeseen circumstances will be considered on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Wages, benefits and paid leaves shall be pro-rated for teachers in job-sharing assignments.</p>
<p>Starting on February 1, the District shall post and update a list of unit members who are interested in<br/>job-sharing and who give their permission for their names to be listed. A unit member who does not<br/>permit his/her name to be listed shall remain eligible to job-share.</p>
<p>In the event that a job share arrangement terminates, the right to remain at the school at which the<br/>job-share occurred, the &quot;home school,&quot; shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partner who teaches more than 50% of the job share shall have the right to remain at the<br/>school unless no position is available due to a reduction in staff at the school.</p>
<p>The partner who teaches less than 50% shall be assigned through the annual voluntary transfer<br/>process or assigned following the transfer process by the Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Administrative Services.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both partners teach 50%, then the partner with the highest seniority at the site shall have the<br/>right to remain at the school unless no position is available due to a reduction in staff at the<br/>school.</p>
<p>The other partner shall be assigned through the annual voluntary transfer process or assigned<br/>following the transfer process by the Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both 50% partners have equal site seniority, the partner with the highest seniority in the<br/>District shall have the right to remain at the school unless no position is available due to a<br/>reduction in staff at the school.</p>
<p>The other partner shall be assigned through the annual voluntary transfer process or assigned<br/>following the transfer process by the Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both 50% partners have equal site and district seniority, a lottery shall be conducted between<br/>the partners to determine the one who has the right to remain at the school unless no position is<br/>available due to a reduction in staff at the school.</p>
<p>The other partner shall be assigned through the annual voluntary transfer process or assigned<br/>following the transfer process by the Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no position available at the &quot;home school&quot; due to a reduction in staff, both job partners<br/>shall be assigned through the annual voluntary transfer process or assigned following the transfer<br/>process by the Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services.</p>
<p>Military Leave</p>
<p>A military leave of absence shall be granted to any unit member in accordance with provisions of law<br/>who enters the active military service of the United States of America, the State of California, or the<br/>United States Merchant Marine during any period of national emergency declared by the President of<br/>the United States of America, or during any war in which the United States of America is engaged.<br/>When the District grants military leave, such leave shall be granted without salary, except as provided<br/>by law.</p>
<p>A unit member with permanent status shall be entitled to return to the position held by him/her at the<br/>time of his/her entrance into such service, provided such return is within three months after he/she<br/>honorably leaves such service or has been placed on inactive duty.</p>
<p>A unit member with probationary status who has been employed in excess of one year in a position in<br/>which s/he has not become a permanent employee shall be entitled to return to such position for the<br/>period his/her employment contract had to run at the time s/he entered such service, provided such<br/>return is within three months after s/he honorably leaves such service or has been placed on inactive<br/>duty.</p>
<p>A unit member who is granted a military leave shall earn service increments the same as s/he would<br/>have earned for such increments had s/he continued his/her position with the District. The time served<br/>on military service shall be included as service in computing retirement benefits, but it shall not be<br/>counted as a part of the service required as a condition precedent to attaining permanent<br/>classification.</p>
<p>A unit member who is a member of the reserve corps of the armed forces of the United States, or of<br/>the National Guard or National Militia, shall be entitled to temporary military leave of absence while<br/>engaged in military duty ordered for a purpose of active military training, drills, encampment, naval<br/>cruises, special exercises or like activity, said military leave to be in accordance with mandatory<br/>provisions of the Military and Veterans Code and Education Code of the State of California.</p>
<p>Unit members shall, insofar as possible, arrange intermittent periods of temporary military duty at<br/>times when the regular schools of the District are not in session.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>A sabbatical leave of absence for a period not to exceed one school year may be granted a unit<br/>member for the purpose of permitting professional study, travel, or research, subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have rendered at least seven (7) consecutive school years of service to the<br/>District immediately preceding the school year for which sabbatical leave is requested.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sabbatical leave of absence is an opportunity to prepare for improved service that will benefit<br/>the schools and students of Goleta Union School District. The unit member requesting sabbatical<br/>leave shall therefore develop, present, and arrange to fulfill a program of activity that will be of<br/>benefit to the schools and students of the District, and upon return from sabbatical leave shall<br/>present a report to the Superintendent or his/her designee verifying compliance with the<br/>accepted program of activity.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of employees on sabbatical leave during any one school year shall not exceed two<br/>percent (2%) of the total number of certificated employees in the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member on sabbatical leave is considered to be a regular employee of the District insofar<br/>as placement on the salary schedule, fringe benefits, and other rights are concerned. Time on<br/>sabbatical leave shall be counted toward retirement in the same manner that a year of active<br/>service shall count. An employee shall receive full-time service credit toward retirement for a<br/>period of sabbatical leave providing the employee pays to the retirement system additional<br/>contributions based on the compensation which is the difference between compensation earned<br/>and the compensation earnable during the period of sabbatical leave. The District shall pay the<br/>amount it normally would be required to pay as employer during the sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on sabbatical leave shall receive seventy-five percent (75%) of their normal<br/>contract salary.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excepting for reasons of death, or physical or mental disability, the unit member shall be required<br/>to serve the District for at least two years following his/her return from sabbatical leave. The unit<br/>member shall indemnify the Board of Trustees against loss in the event he/she fails to render<br/>service by furnishing in advance of the sabbatical leave a suitable bond, paid for by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>Sabbatical Leave Procedures - Application</p>
<p>Application for sabbatical leave shall be made in accordance with a timeline and on forms to be<br/>adopted each school year by the Board of Trustees. Any unit member who has completed seven or<br/>more consecutive years of service with Goleta Union School District is eligible to apply for sabbatical<br/>leave. The Board of Trustees will announce successful applicants for sabbatical leave by March 1st of<br/>each year, unless the Board, in its discretion, decides not to grant any sabbatical leaves in any given<br/>school year. The determination of whether to grant sabbatical leave rests solely with the Board of<br/>Trustees, and the existence of this section shall not be construed to mean that sabbatical leave must<br/>be granted. The granting of any sabbatical leave shall be based solely upon the criteria of benefit to the<br/>students of Goleta Union School District.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>If a unit member on sabbatical leave suffers an accident or illness causing an interruption of the stated<br/>activity for which the leave was granted, the unit member shall notify the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee within two weeks of such accident or illness. Such notification must include a doctor's<br/>verification of the unit member's physical condition.</p>
<p>Serious accident or illness suffered during the period of leave shall not affect the amount of<br/>compensation to be paid to the unit member.</p>
<p>Required Duties and Reports</p>
<p>A unit member granted sabbatical leave shall enter into a written agreement with the Board of<br/>Trustees stipulating the purpose of the leave, the work and/or study to be undertaken while on leave<br/>and any reports and/or duties required of the unit member while on leave or following his/her return<br/>to the District. The application form submitted shall be a part of such agreement and shall state in<br/>reasonable detail the benefits that will accrue to the District and the method by which such benefits<br/>shall be provided. Any amendments, modifications, or changes in the agreement must be approved by<br/>the Board of Trustees, and may not be made unilaterally by the unit member.</p>
<p>Return to Duty</p>
<p>Following the period of sabbatical leave, a unit member shall be permitted to return to his/her former<br/>school and teaching assignment unless: (a) a request is submitted and granted for transfer to another<br/>assignment, or (b) there is a reduction in the size of the school staff. The seniority ranking of a unit<br/>member on sabbatical leave shall not be affected by the leave.</p>
<p>Sabbatical Leave Review Committee</p>
<p>The seven-member Sabbatical Leave Review Committee shall be comprised of three unit members<br/>selected by the Association, three management employees selected by the Superintendent, and the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services.</p>
<p>Unpaid Leave</p>
<p>Such leaves are permissive with the District, except for leave for one person from the Association,<br/>which leave shall be granted if requested, without pay for up to one year, for Association business.</p>
<p>An employee who takes unpaid leave for a period of more than four (4) months shall lose seniority at<br/>his/her site. The four-month period does not include pregnancy disability or family leave.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>14. Safety</p>
<p>The District will make reasonable efforts to provide a safe working environment for members of the<br/>bargaining unit.</p>

<p>In the event the situation is not remedied to the satisfaction of the complainant within twenty (20)<br/>District working days of submission of the written complaint, the matter may be appealed in writing to<br/>the Superintendent.</p>
<p>In the event the situation is not remedied to the satisfaction of the complainant within twenty (20)<br/>District working days of appeal to the Superintendent, the matter may be appealed in writing to the<br/>Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>15. Concerted Activities</p>
<p>It is agreed and understood that there will be no strike, work stoppage, slowdown, unlawful picketing,<br/>or refusal or failure to fully and faithfully perform job functions and responsibilities, or other<br/>interference with the operations of the District by the Association or by its officers, agents, or<br/>members during the term of this Agreement, including compliance with the request of other labor<br/>organizations to engage in such activity.</p>
<p>The Association recognizes the duty and obligation of its representatives to comply with the provisions<br/>of this Agreement and to make every effort toward inducing all employees to do so. In the event of a<br/>strike, work stoppage, slowdown, or other interference with the operations of the District by<br/>employees who are represented by the Association, the Association agrees in good faith to take all<br/>necessary steps to cause those employees to cease such action.</p>
<p>The Association shall be liable for its contractual obligations under this Article until it has fully complied<br/>with its statutory negotiating obligations in connection with the re-openers provided for in Article XVII<br/>(&quot;Term&quot;), and in connection with the negotiating of a successor Agreement after the completion of the<br/>term hereof.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>16. Completion of Meet and Negotiation</p>
<p>During the term of this Agreement, the Association expressly waives and relinquishes the right to meet<br/>and negotiate and agrees that the District shall not be obligated to meet and negotiate with respect to<br/>any subject or matter referred to or covered in this Agreement, or any subject or matter referenced by<br/>either or both the District or the Association at the time they met and negotiated on and executed this<br/>Agreement, with the exception of the fourth and fifth paragraphs of this Article.</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed that the specific provisions contained in this Agreement shall prevail over<br/>District policies, practices, and State laws to the extent permitted by State law.</p>
<p>If any provisions of this Agreement are held to be contrary to law by a court of competent jurisdiction,<br/>such provisions will not be deemed valid and subsisting except to the extent permitted by law, but all<br/>other provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>If the legislature expands the scope of representation during the term of this Agreement for an<br/>exclusive agent by amending the California Government Code Section 3543.2, and the District intends<br/>to take unilateral action on an item specifically dealt with by the legislative decision, then negotiations<br/>will reopen on that specific item on the next anniversary date of the Agreement. In addition, any<br/>proposed changes in written policy having a significant impact on all members of the bargaining unit<br/>that fall within scope of representation will be negotiated upon request.</p>
<p>If, during the term of the Agreement, the District is found not to have complied with the sixty percent<br/>(60%) requirement of Education Code Section 41372, and the District concurs in such determination,<br/>then the District shall so notify the Association; thereafter, upon written request from the Association,<br/>provided such request is submitted within ten (10) days following the District's notice, the District shall<br/>meet and negotiate with the Association concerning the deficient amount.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>17. Term</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect up to and including June 30, 2015, and thereafter</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall continue in effect year-by-year unless one of the parties notifies the other in writing no later than</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 15 of its request to modify, amend, or terminate the Agreement.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>It is agreed by both parties that at the request of either party they shall meet and negotiate changes in<br/>Article X: Salary, in Article XI: Fringe Benefits, and in one article of each party's choice for the 2016-<br/>2017 and 2017-2018 school years. Any such request to meet and negotiate on said Articles shall be<br/>submitted in writing to the other party no later than March 15 of the year preceding the fiscal year<br/>subject to such negotiation.</p>
