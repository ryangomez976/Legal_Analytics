<p>ARTICLE 6 - GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose and Intent</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Grievance Procedure is established to provide a process through which the<br/>exclusive representative or an employee might attempt to resolve a grievance with<br/>his/her immediate supervisor and, if necessary, with the District Superintendent (or<br/>designee), an advisory arbitrator, and the Board of Education. It is the intent of this<br/>policy that grievances be resolved at the lowest possible level.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions (Applicable to all segments of this Article!</p>

<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;grievant&quot; is the unit member, unit members, or the Association making the<br/>claim.</p>
<p>6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance officer” is the administrator responsible at each step for providing a<br/>decision to the grievant.</p>
<p>6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the grievant is normally required to perform services<br/>for the District under his/her regular yearly contract, excluding summer school.</p>
<p>6.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having immediate<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant who has been designated by the Superintendent or the<br/>Board of Education to administer grievances.</p>
<p>6.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;conferee&quot; may be a District staff member, administrator, District counsel,<br/>certificated employee counsel, or a representative of a recognized certificated<br/>employee organization.</p>
<p>6.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;advisory arbitrator&quot; shall be an impartial third party who is neither an<br/>employee of the District nor an employee or member of the employee association.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Table</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To insure the prompt resolution of a grievance, specific time limits have been<br/>established. However, they may be extended as necessary with the consent of both<br/>parties (District designated grievance officer and grievant). If at any level or step<br/>the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant, it may be appealed<br/>to the next level or step, according to the established procedures.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to seek a<br/>resolution by an informal conference with his/her immediate supervisor.

<p>6.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advisory arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the<br/>terms of this agreement, or the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures<br/>of the District.</p>
<p>6.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written<br/>arguments, the advisory arbitrator shall submit, in writing, to all parties, his/her<br/>findings and recommendation for possible implementation by the Superintendent<br/>or designee within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>6.9 Step 4: Governing Board</p>
<p>6.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either party fails to appeal the award within the time limits established, the<br/>recommendation of the arbitrator shall be implemented. However, if either of the<br/>parties is not satisfied with the recommendations of the advisory arbitrator, a<br/>written appeal may be made to the Governing Board within ten (10) days following<br/>receipt of the advisory arbitrator's report.

<p>6.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governing Board has the power to render a final and binding determination of<br/>a grievance. The recommendation of the arbitrator shall only be advisory; and if,<br/>upon review, the Governing Board determines that it is unable to render final<br/>determination on the record, it may reopen the record for the taking of additional<br/>evidence.</p>
<p>6.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Governing Board has reached a decision, the Superintendent or designee<br/>will be directed to inform the parties and implement the decision.</p>

This should not preclude the right of either party to separately make<br/>an investigation of the facts without the presence or interference of a conferee.</p>
<p>6.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person involved in the grievance process who intends to be represented by a<br/>conferee at any meeting shall give notice at least twenty-four (24) hours, but not<br/>more than five (5) days, in advance of said meeting to the grievance officer<br/>designating who such representative shall be.

<p>6.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions to challenge or change the policies of the District or any specific contract<br/>provision must be undertaken under separate legal processes.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>6.10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other matters for which a specific method of review is provided by law, by the<br/>policies of the Board of Education, or by the Administrative regulations and<br/>procedures of this school district are not within the scope of this procedure.</p>
<p>6.10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at a level above principal or immediate supervisor, the grieved<br/>person or the Association shall submit such grievance in writing to the<br/>Superintendent; and the processing of such grievance shall begin at Step 2.</p>

<p>9.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness or injury” is defined as an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time or</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>that incapacitates a member of the employee’s immediate family whose<br/>incapacity requires the employee to take time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time to care for that family member and taking<br/>extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the employee<br/>because he/she has exhausted all his/her sick leave, excluding<br/>differential leave. A doctor’s verification is required.</p>
<p>9.4.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate family”, for the purpose of catastrophic leave, shall be<br/>defined as spouse, domestic partner, child, step-child, parent, and any<br/>relative currently living in the immediate household of the employee.</p>

<p>9.4.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of ten workdays of illness or injury must be covered by the</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>participant’s own sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay the<br/>first time the participant qualifies for a withdrawal from the Bank. If<br/>the same illness/injury recurs within twelve months of the beginning of<br/>the leave, the ten-day requirement will be waived.</p>
<p>9.4.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family members may apply for catastrophic leave on behalf of the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>9.4.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave is granted for up to thirty (30) work days at a time to a maximum<br/>of ninety (90) work days. The ninety (90) work day limit may be<br/>waived by a unanimous vote of the Catastrophic Leave Committee.</p>

<p>9.4.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this provision is rescinded, the Committee will continue to administer<br/>Catastrophic Leave days until the days in the Bank are exhausted.</p>
<p>9.4.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days accumulated is maintained at or above 25% of<br/>the amount equivalent to the number of members in the Bank, no<br/>contributions will be assessed for that year except for new members<br/>wishing to join the Bank.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10 - CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>For the purposes of class size, schools shall be staffed according to the provisions of this Article for<br/>schools utilizing either a 4 or 6-period student day. Should a school site utilize alternative<br/>scheduling, this article will be negotiated to address staffing ratios.</p>
<p>10.1 High Schools and Middle Schools</p>
<p>10.1.1 Secondary teachers with a 6-period day shall have a maximum of 175 daily student<br/>contacts, with the exception of music and physical education teachers whose<br/>maximum daily contacts will not exceed 200, and the exception of teachers of<br/>District-authorized remedial classes whose maximum daily contacts will not exceed<br/>100. Secondary teachers with a 4-period day shall have a maximum of 105 daily<br/>student contacts, with the exception of music and physical education teachers whose<br/>maximum daily contacts will not exceed 120, and the exception of teachers of<br/>District-authorized remedial classes whose maximum daily contacts will not exceed<br/>60. Individual teachers may agree to exceed their maximum student contacts to<br/>meet their individual program needs. Less than full time teachers, or teachers with<br/>combined student maximums, will be assigned student maximums on a proportional</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>basis. Individual class maximums will not exceed established safety maximums<br/>previously authorized by the fire department and the District’s insurance providers.</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual class sizes shall not exceed 37 students per class, with the exception of<br/>music and physical education class sizes which shall not exceed 45 students per<br/>class. District-authorized remedial classes shall not exceed 25 students per class.<br/>Individual teachers may agree to exceed their class maximums. During the first two<br/>weeks of instruction of each school year or first week of each term for a 4-period<br/>day, class sizes may exceed the maximums in order to balance and finalize the<br/>master schedule. An exception to these limits will only occur if the following<br/>requirements are met:</p>

<p>year.</p>
<p>10.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator has contacted the assigned teacher to discuss the reason<br/>for the class size and provides in writing the timeline for reducing to the<br/>appropriate maximum contacts within the semester/trimester.</p>

<p>Ki ndergarten &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>1-3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>4-6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34</p>
<p>10.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At elementary schools with SDC and newcomer classes, regular classes at that site<br/>will be staffed at the District-wide average if that class is the same grade as the<br/>designated grade levels in the SDC or newcomer class.</p>
<p>10.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and FCEA agree to form a task force to study kindergarten class size<br/>reduction and prepare a report with recommendations for consideration by FCEA<br/>and the District by July 1, 2008.</p>
<p>10.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deviations from the recommended average or maximum class size may be<br/>authorized by the Superintendent or designee after consultation with the classroom<br/>teacher in order to meet unique student needs.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following certificated employees shall not be included in computing allocation under<br/>this Article:</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Music Teachers</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses</p>
<p>10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the State provides specific funding for reduction of class size and corresponding funding</p>
<p>increases for facilities, the District and bargaining agent will meet and problem solve to</p>
<p>provide recommendations for implementation.</p>
<p>10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size for Full Inclusion Students</p>
<p>10.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this sub-article (10.5), students from the “inclusion caseload”<br/>means the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDC-Inclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(SDC-I)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDC-Visually Handicapped&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(SDC-VH)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDC-Deafand Hard of Hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(SDC-DHOH)</p>
<p>10.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At elementary schools with inclusion classes, whenever reasonably possible, the<br/>District will load regular classes that include students from the “inclusion<br/>caseload” at the District-wide average, (K at 31, grades 1 -3 at 30, and grades 4-6 at<br/>30). In the case of classes participating in class size reduction, no more than 20.<br/>While inclusion students will be counted for the purpose of establishing the size of<br/>the regular class, they will not count for CSR funding. The ADA for inclusion<br/>students will be earned through their SDC assignment.</p>
<p>10.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A regular class that includes SDC-I students may exceed the class sizes stated<br/>above by a maximum of two (2) students, provided the need for placement of SDC-<br/>I students warrants. Except as noted in 10.5.4 below, only SDC-I students will be<br/>placed into a classroom in excess of the District wide averages listed above.</p>
<p>10.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is unlikely that the District will need to exceed the maximum of two (2)<br/>students set forth in 10.5.3, the parties acknowledge that there must be space<br/>available for a transferring-in student who requires SDC-VH and/or SDC-DHOH<br/>services. Accordingly, it is agreed that these two disability areas may exceed the<br/>two (2) student maximum restriction set forth in 10.5.3 by one (1) additional<br/>student.</p>
<p>10.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any class that exceeds the averages listed in 10.5.2 and 10.5.3 above will not have<br/>additional regular students assigned to that class until the number of enrolled<br/>students drops below the appropriate District-wide average.</p>

<p>16.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculating the “Effective Increase”</p>
<p>16.7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PARTIES’ INTENT is that those dollars added to the prior<br/>year’s BRL due to COLA, Equalization, and Deficit Reduction factor<br/>shall be used to calculate the “Effective Increase” to the District’s<br/>base revenue limit.</p>

<p>assuming the State acts for 2007/08 in the same manner that it acted<br/>in 2006/07, shall be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>1. Multiply EDP #024 (which is the 2006/07 Base Revenue<br/>Limit per ADA) from Form K-12(A) times EDP #086 (which<br/>is the 2006/07 deficit factor).</p>
<p>Multiply EDP #024 (which is the 2007/08 Base Revenue</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Limit per ADA) from Form K-12(A) times EDP #086 (which<br/>is the 2007/08 deficit factor).</p>
<p>3. Subtract the product derived from the calculation in #1 from<br/>the product derived from the calculation in #2; divide that<br/>sum by the product derived from the calculation in #1.</p>

<p>If there is no objection from the Association (see 16.7.3.5 below), the<br/>District will increase the salary schedule for the fiscal year<br/>retroactively, effective July 1, according to the requisite percentage<br/>required by the formula.</p></td></tr>

<p>BASIC TEACHER SALARY SCHFUTTT/F.</p>
<p>COMPENSATION AND RELATED BENEFITS: GENERAL PROVISIONS:</p>
<p>The Folsom Cordova Unified School District has established a five-class single salary schedule</p>
<p>based on training, years of experience, and professional growth. (Copy attached).</p>
<p>Initial placement on the salary schedule shall be made on the basis of training and experience.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All outside experience for which a credential is required, whether sequential or on an<br/>interrupted basis, will be credited on a one (1) step for one (1) year experience basis to a<br/>maximum of nine (9) years experience. The maximum experience allowable, therefore, will<br/>place the teacher on the tenth (10th) step of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All experience within the District for which a credential is required will be credited on a one<br/>(1) step for one (1) year basis.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive longevity step credit, a credentialed employee must have worked 75 percent or<br/>more of the required workdays of the school year for which such credit is granted.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-half year's credit will be given for service within the District for less than 75 percent but<br/>more than 50 percent of the required workdays of the school year for which credit is granted.<br/>This credit shall be cumulative to whole years.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year's credit will be given for working within the District for less than 75 percent of the<br/>required workdays if: 1) the employee is employed for two successive years and, 2) has<br/>served in excess of 75 percent of the total required workdays for both years.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit on the salary schedule will be given for substitute teaching if the teacher substituted in<br/>the District 130 days or more in a given year. A maximum of one (1) step on the salary<br/>schedule may be granted for substitute teaching. One-half year's credit will be given for<br/>substitute teaching within the District for less than 130 days but more than one-half of the<br/>school year. This credit shall be cumulative to a maximum of one (1) year.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for college level teaching will be granted if it is comparable to 3/4 of a full time<br/>assignment as defined by the college.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those units earned from accredited institutions or approved District in-service, after the<br/>degree has been granted, will be credited towards salary advancement.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>ADVANCEMENT IN CLASSIFICATION;</p>
<p>A. For the term of this Agreement, advancement on the salary schedule will be made on the<br/>basis of evidence of units earned furnished by each certificated employee.</p>
<p>Units for advancement on the District salary schedule shall be approved by the District<br/>Personnel Office.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary schedule credit may be granted for units received from District in-service<br/>workshops.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit may be granted for units received from accredited institutions under the<br/>following guidelines:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units related to major or minor</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units related to the development of a new teaching major or minor</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units related to credential additions or modifications</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units recommended by the principal/designee</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units related to a Masters' degree or Doctorate degree program</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units related to current assignments</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for credit shall be made by submitting official transcripts or grade cards<br/>by October 1st.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units shall accrue from year to year until sufficient units have accumulated for a<br/>salary schedule class advancement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher disagrees with the District's decision on approval of units for salary<br/>schedule advancement, the teacher may appeal to a Credit Evaluation Committee,<br/>whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p>a. The Committee shall be composed of two (2) teachers chosen by the<br/>Association and two (2) administrators chosen by District administration.</p>
<p>INCREMENT;</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the term of this Agreement, increments are granted annually based on satisfactory<br/>performance until the last step on the class is reached. Vertical movement on the salary<br/>schedule is limited to one step per year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers and other certificated personnel must have served seventy-five percent of the<br/>annual required days of service to qualify for the annual salary step increase.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated personnel on an extended sick leave (5 month differential) as a result of a<br/>work-incurred accident or illness shall count those days as days of service.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING DEADLINES ARE SET FOR FILING OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS OR<br/>OFFICIAL GRADE CARDS FOR SALARY ADJUSTMENTS:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 1 - June 30 contracts: June 1 st is the last day for receipt of units for adjustment effective<br/>July 1st.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 1 - August 31 contracts: August 1 st is the last day for receipt of units for salary<br/>adjustment effective September 1st.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 1 st is the last day for receipt of official transcripts or official grade cards for salary<br/>adjustment for the current school year. Units submitted past this deadline shall not be used<br/>for salary advancement for the current year.</p>
<p>All units submitted before the deadline that meet the requirements for salary advancement<br/>shall be credited and reflected on the November payroll to be received by the employee on<br/>November 30th.</p>

<p>cr/nego/cert rote sal sched 9.2010</p>
<p>Appendix D</p>
<p>CERTIFICATED EXTRA CURRICULAR STIPEND SCHEDULES</p>
<p>Payment will be made, only as provided for in the annual budget, in accordance with the following<br/>schedules. Such payment will be in a lump sum on the supplementary payroll at the conclusion of<br/>the activity for the individual assignment.</p>
<p>For each year of this Agreement, the stipends set forth in this Appendix D-l and D-2 shall be<br/>improved each July by the same percentage as the certificated salary schedule.</p>
<p>Major Clubs - Minimum: Two (2) meetings per month, * 15 participants, two (2) service projects per<br/>year. This service project benefits school or community. It is not a money-raising activity for the<br/>benefit of the club itself, or an activity for the membership of the club.</p>
<p>Minor Clubs - Minimum: Two (2) meetings per month and *15 participants. No service project<br/>requirements.</p>
<p>Special Service Club: Sole purpose of the club is service directly related to an athletic season or<br/>school function. Club activity coincides with the athletic season for functions, i.e., Trackettes,<br/>Swimmettes, and Library. No class time is scheduled.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of highly specialized club activities where there are less than fifteen (15) participants,<br/>permission from the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources is required before activating<br/>the club.</p>
<p>The District reserves the right to determine the number and kinds of personnel necessary for the safe<br/>and/or efficient operation of the extracurricular program.</p>
<p>Employees may not be involuntarily assigned to perform duties listed on this extracurricular<br/>assignment pay schedule; however, once such an assignment has been accepted it must be fully<br/>completed as directed by the site level administrators or their designee.</p>
<p>ATHLETICS:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assistant is employed when 20-40 students are involved in the football, track, wrestling or<br/>swimming program and other assistants when the number of participants exceeds forty (40, 20<br/>per assistant). For purposes of preliminary staffing, the number actively participating in the last<br/>meet of the previous season is the determining factor.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in a championship playoff, additional payment requests will be submitted at the conclusion of<br/>the activity. Extended season payment is based on the stipend divided by twelve (12), (season is<br/>considered to be 12 weeks), for one (1) week: divided again by five (5) for a daily rate.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff is determined by the average number of active participants in the previous year. An<br/>assistant is authorized when forty-six (46) students are involved in the program and a second<br/>assistant when the number of participants exceeds ninety-two (92).</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for extracurricular pay is determined by a minimum of thirty-six (36) activity sessions<br/>and four (4) special athletic events.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this agreement, the extracurricular stipend for coaches of high school varsity<br/>sports will be increased should their team be administratively approved by the Principal and<br/>otherwise required to participate in post-season playoffs. The amount of this increase in stipend<br/>shall generally provide proportional weekly pay for each week beyond the regular league season,<br/>but in no case shall exceed thirty percent (30%) of the original stipend. This increase shall in no<br/>way be considered a bonus. It is intended only to provide compensation for the extra time<br/>involved.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season begins on the first day the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), or the league,<br/>and the District allow practice to begin, or the day practice actually begins with District<br/>approval. The coach must be in attendance for the practice to be official. The season ends on<br/>the date of the last league game for football, baseball, volleyball, soccer, and basketball. The<br/>season ends at the conclusion of the sectional meets for all other sports.</p>
<p>MUSIC:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that the term &quot;concert&quot; refers to a formal, planned, and publicized evening<br/>performance designed for students, parents, school, and community.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;Music Festival&quot; must be a CMEA sanctioned event. Each individual ensemble must perform<br/>on its own at a CMEA festival to qualify for extra-curricular pay. It is possible to combine<br/>groups at a festival, but prior approval from the Music Department Chair is required. <sup>•</sup></p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These &quot;requirements&quot; for extra-curricular pay represent a minimum. It is expected that each<br/>music teacher will be responsive to requests from their administration and community to perform<br/>at worthwhile functions. These would include, but not be limited to: pep rallies, community<br/>events, school assemblies, patriotic observances, etc.</p>
<p>Extra Curricular Longevity Stipend:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one (1) service credit may be earned per any one (1) academic year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only service credits earned after 7/01/86 are applicable.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for &quot;bonus'V'longevity&quot; stipend is based on any paid FCUSD extracurricular service<br/>and need not be continuous or consecutive service.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previous service is based on the individual's proven written record of employment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon commencement of the fourth year of extracurricular service, a 5% factor will be<br/>applied to the employee’s extracurricular stipend.</p>

<p>All of the above being equal, the final determination shall be made based<br/>upon seniority and program needs. If the final determination is not based on<br/>seniority, the affected employee will be given the program reason(s) in<br/>writing.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tentative track assignments for new YRE schools or additional tracks will,<br/>when possible, be communicated to affected employees by April 1st. When<br/>this is not possible, affected employees will be given the reason(s) for the<br/>delay in writing.</p>

<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member involuntarily transferred to a YRE school who has a child<br/>attending school within the District will have his/her child, when desired,<br/>assigned to a like schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are transferred from a YRE site/track by the District will be<br/>scheduled to insure that they shall earn not less than the annual salary and retirement<br/>credit specified in their initial contract for that year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a transfer is made to a track whose last day is later than the original track, resulting<br/>in days to be worked which are greater than the correct number of FTE base days; the<br/>employee will be notified that the excess days are not creditable for additional<br/>retirement credit. (You can't get more than 100% credit for any year's employment<br/>for STRS or PERS.)</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members requesting and receiving approval for a similar position on a different<br/>calendar year could possibly result in lower annual compensation or less than a full<br/>year increment of retirement credit.

<p>Office by October 1st.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>COMMUNICATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members at a year round school will be eligible for any benefits provided by the<br/>FCEA contract or District policies. Those benefits include, but are not limited to,<br/>opportunity to serve as mentor teachers or on District committees, SIP activities,<br/>professional growth conferences. Curriculum Advisory Committees, or any leaves<br/>delineated in the FCEA contract.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and/or each site will mail pertinent communication to off track unit members in a<br/>timely manner.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SST meetings will not be scheduled during the classroom teacher's off track time.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEAVES</p>
<p>In Article 9 of the FCEA contract, add the words &quot;trimester or YRE track&quot; where the word</p>
<p>&quot;semester&quot; occurs.</p>
<p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROVERS AND ROTATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If overcrowding requires that more than one (1) teacher be assigned to a common<br/>classroom, elementary YRE schools will use the rotation system. In secondary YRE<br/>schools, the principal, with input from the staff, shall decide which system(s), roving<br/>and/or rotation, will best meet the educational needs.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotation is defined as a system of room sharing where teachers going off-track<br/>release their room to a teacher coming on-track. Teachers coming on-track are<br/>assigned a different classroom than they had during the previous track. Teachers<br/>change rooms every time they return from break.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roving is defined as a system of room sharing where teachers going off track release<br/>their room to a roving teacher. When the teacher comes back on track, they return to<br/>their original classroom and the roving teacher moves on. The fact that a secondary<br/>teacher may be assigned to more than one classroom as a part of their regular<br/>assignment does not make them a roving teacher.</p>
<p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALARY AND BENEFITS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YRE unit members may remain on their current pay cycle, September through<br/>August.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YRE unit members who wish to change to a pay cycle of July-June will have the<br/>opportunity to discuss with the Personnel Department the pros and cons. This<br/>change must be done in writing prior to May 1st. Should an employee change to a<br/>July-June pay cycle and is then involved in a transfer that would ordinarily involve a<br/>change in pay cycle to a September-August, that employee may remain on his/her<br/>pay cycle for two (2) years.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee, who has been prepaid, leaves the District for any reason, he/she will<br/>be responsible for paying back the District any prepaid salary received.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee, who has worked days for which he/she has not been paid, leaves the<br/>District for any reason, the District will pay the employee any monies due.</p>

<p>AND THE</p>
<p>FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>This MOU is intended to implement the provision of Chapter Four (4) of the Statutes of 1999 with<br/>respect to the Peer Assistance and Review Program (PAR), as it may be amended, and any<br/>application regulations. The parties agree that the focus of the Peer Assistance and Review Program<br/>(PAR) shall be to provide assistance, not to evaluate.</p>
<p>Once negotiations are concluded on a PAR process, the FCUSD shall provide the required<br/>certification that PAR will be implemented beginning July 1, 2000. Effective on July 1, 2000, the<br/>mentor teacher program and all obligations, rights, activities, and practices related to that program<br/>shall automatically terminate.</p>
<p>I. PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW JOINT COMMITTEE (JOINT</p>
<p>COMMITTEE)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee will consist of five (5) members. Members of the Joint<br/>Committee will include the FCEA President or designee, plus two (2) members and<br/>one (1) alternate selected by the FCEA, and two (2) members and one (1) alternate<br/>selected by the District. A Joint Committee member may not participate in the Joint<br/>Committee consideration, assessment, or acceptance of a report that pertains to a<br/>Participating Teacher whose most recent evaluation was conducted by that council<br/>member.

<p>In the first year, alternates will be paid the same as regular panel members. The<br/>expense of stipends and paid release time for Joint Committee members shall be<br/>reflected within the annual budget adopted by the Joint Committee. If required to<br/>attend meetings, the FCEA alternate will be paid the same rate as a regular member.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee shall be responsible for selecting Consulting Teachers (defined<br/>in section III), assessing Assistance Plans and related documentation prepared by<br/>Consulting Teachers, and providing in-service training for Consulting Teachers. The<br/>Joint Committee will provide written confirmation of participation in the PAR</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>program to Participating Teachers, principals or immediate supervisors, and<br/>Consulting Teachers.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee will adopt guidelines for implementing the provisions of this<br/>Memorandum of Understanding. The guidelines will be consistent with the<br/>provisions of this Agreement and applicable law, and to the extent that there is an<br/>inconsistency, the Agreement will prevail; and to the extent the Agreement is<br/>inconsistent with the law, the law will prevail.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee will assign the Consulting Teacher to a Participating Teacher.<br/>The Participating Teacher may appeal the Joint Committee’s designation of a<br/>Consulting Teacher in accordance with procedures developed by the Joint<br/>Committee. The Participating Teacher may request to meet with the Joint<br/>Committee to discuss the assignment of the Consulting Teacher within two weeks of<br/>notification.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties intend that all documentation and information related to participation in<br/>the PAR program will be regarded as a personnel matter, subject to the personnel<br/>record exemption of the Public Records Act contained within Government Code<br/>6250 et. seq.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee will develop standards and guidelines to be used by the<br/>Consulting Teacher in working with and assessing participants. This will include,<br/>but not be limited to, timelines for completion of peer review reports for submission<br/>to the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee will review the final report prepared by the Consulting Teacher.<br/>The Joint Committee will make recommendations to the Governing Board regarding<br/>a referred Participating Teacher’s progress in the PAR program. The Joint<br/>Committee will also provide to the Governing Board names of participants not able<br/>to demonstrate satisfactory improvement after receiving sustained assistance.</p>

<p>II. PARTICIPATING TEACHER</p>
<p>A Participating Teacher is a classroom teacher who is to receive assistance and coaching to</p>
<p>improve instructional skills, classroom management, knowledge of instructional subject</p>
<p>matter, and related aspects of teacher performance. There are two categories of Participating</p>
<p>Teachers: those who are referred for participation and those who volunteer to participate.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Referred Participating Teacher</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of participation in the PAR program is to help correct job-related<br/>deficiencies and to assist the classroom teacher in improving performance.<br/>Permanent classroom teachers who have received an unsatisfactory rating will be<br/>referred for participation in PAR.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher assigned by the Joint Committee will provide assistance<br/>to the Referred Participating Teacher until the Consulting Teacher concludes that<br/>further assistance will not be beneficial. The Consulting Teacher will then submit<br/>a final report of the teacher’s participation in the program to the Joint Committee.<br/>The Referred Participating Teacher may submit a written response to the final<br/>report and/or request a meeting with the Joint Committee subject to the rules<br/>established by the Joint Committee. A copy of the Consulting Teacher’s final<br/>report shall be provided to the Referred Participating Teacher and prior to its<br/>submission to the Joint Committee. The Evaluator will be provided the<br/>opportunity to address the Joint Committee upon request. The Evaluator’s<br/>comments shall be advisory only.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Committee will forward a summary report of the teacher’s participation<br/>in the program to the Governing Board, Superintendent, or designee. The report<br/>and recommendation(s) of the Joint Committee and the peer review reports<br/>prepared by the Consulting Teachers shall be advisory only. These reports will be<br/>for the benefit of the Referred Participating Teacher and the District and shall in<br/>no way limit the District’s discretion or authority on decisions and actions<br/>regarding the employment status of any employee. The fact that the employee is<br/>participating in PAR will not limit or delay the District’s authority or discretion to<br/>make any such decision or take any such action. Participation in PAR will not<br/>create any right or expectancy of continued employment by the District for any<br/>period of time.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the Referred Participating Teacher’s participation in PAR may be<br/>used in the evaluation of the teacher pursuant to Education Code 44660 et seq.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation is not provided to the Referred Participating Teacher for<br/>participation in PAR, except for authorized participation in activities such as<br/>workshops and seminars beyond the regular workday.</p>
<p>A. Voluntary Participating Teacher</p>
<p>A Voluntary Participating Teacher is a permanent teacher who seeks to improve<br/>his/her teaching performance. A Voluntary Participating Teacher may request the<br/>Joint Committee to assign a Consulting Teacher to provide peer assistance. The<br/>Consulting Teacher will not play a role in the evaluation of the Voluntary<br/>Participating Teacher. At his/her own discretion, a Voluntary Participating<br/>Teacher may terminate participation in PAR at any time.</p>

<p>CERTIFICATED EVALUATION</p>
<p>THE FOLSOM CORDOVA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>AND THE</p>
<p>FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>FOR THE PERIOD OF JULY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2011</p>
<p>THE PARTIES WILL MEET IN MAY OF 2003 TO NEGOTIATE<br/>A CONTINUING OR SUCCESSOR MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>The purpose of this M.O.U. is to provide guidelines for the implementation of the new forms and</p>
<p>procedures for certificated evaluations.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12 - TEACHER EVALUATION</p>
<p>12.1 Frequency of Evaluation</p>
<p>Prior to the start of the school year, the District will establish and provide to FCEA, a<br/>calendar listing the specific dates that correspond with this language.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and Temporary Unit Members</p>
<p>Each probationary and/or temporary unit member shall be evaluated on a continuing<br/>basis. A formal evaluation, based on the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession (CSTP) shall be completed each school year. These unit members will<br/>receive evaluations on or before the end of the second week of December and on or<br/>before the end of the last week of April.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Unit Members</p>
<p>Each permanent unit member shall be evaluated on a continuing basis. A formal<br/>evaluation, based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP)<br/>shall be completed at least every other year. These unit members will receive<br/>evaluations on or before the end of the last week of April.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members given a rating of “Practice Not Consistent with<br/>Minimum Standards: Unsatisfactory” in any category on the Summary<br/>Evaluation Form, shall be formally evaluated the next school year on the<br/>standard(s) rated as unsatisfactory. The following year the employee will<br/>resume the evaluation cycle with a regular evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members receiving a rating of “Practice Not Consistent with Minimum<br/>Standards: Unsatisfactory” in two (2) out of the first four (4) CSTP’s shall be<br/>rated “Unsatisfactory” overall and referred to the PAR Program. In order for<br/>the standard to be unsatisfactory overall, a majority of the elements must be<br/>marked “Practice Not Consistent with Minimum Standards”. This rating<br/>shall be determined by the Certificated Evaluation Rubric (see attached).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a permanent unit member is given a rating of “Practice Not Consistent with<br/>Minimum Standards: Unsatisfactory” in any one (1) of the first four (4)<br/>CSTP’s, he/she may be referred to the PAR Program.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>4. If a permanent unit member was regularly rated “Consistent with<br/>Professional Standards” in the past, using the prior evaluation documents, but<br/>now receives “Practice not Consistent with Professional Standards’’ using<br/>the new documents, the evaluator will be asked to provide, in written form,<br/>how that member’s teaching performance has changed dramatically since the<br/>last evaluation cycle. This will be done before the teacher would be referred<br/>to the PAR Program.</p>
<p>12.2 Areas of Evaluation</p>
<p>A. The District shall evaluate and assess certificated unit members teaching<br/>performance as it relates to California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP).<br/>These standards are:</p>
<p>Standard 1:<br/>Standard 2:<br/>Standard 3:<br/>Standard 4:</p>
<p>Standard 5:<br/>Standard 6:</p>
<p>Engaging and supporting all students in learning.</p>
<p>Creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning.<br/>Understanding and organizing subject matter for student learning.<br/>Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all<br/>students.</p>
<p>Assessing student learning.</p>
<p>Developing as a professional educator.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-instructional unit members (nurses, counselors, speech therapists, psychologists,</p>
<p>lead teachers, program specialists, and non self-contained classroom special<br/>education teachers) shall be evaluated on the fulfillment of duties as defined in their<br/>job descriptions. Upon request, unit members will be provided a copy of their job<br/>description.</p>
<p>12.3 Use of Publisher’s Norms</p>
<p>The evaluation and assessment of unit member’s performance pursuant to this Article shall<br/>not include the use of publishers norms established by standardized tests.</p>
<p>12.4. Notice to Unit Members</p>
<p>No later than the end of the second week of September, the District shall give unit members<br/>being evaluated a copy of the evaluation procedures, the evaluation forms, the criteria upon<br/>which the evaluation is to be based (CSTP’s), and the identity of their evaluator. In addition,<br/>the District shall give each temporary and probationary unit member the name of an<br/>experienced person (CT, BTSA Support Provider, or peer teacher) who will provide him or<br/>her assistance.</p>
<p>12.5. Conference and Evaluation Plan</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the end of the sixth week of school, the evaluator and the staff member<br/>being formally evaluated will meet to review the CSTP’s and site-specific goals for<br/>the year, and the process for evaluation. The discussion will center on improving<br/>student performance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence gathered outside of classroom observations may include any of the<br/>following as documentation of progress toward meeting the CSTP’s stated above:<br/>video tapes, curriculum units, teacher journals, logs and calendars, interviews, lesson<br/>plans, communications with parents/students, examples of student work, records of<br/>participation in school improvement efforts, and reports on professional growth</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>activities.</p>
<p>C. In this conference, arrangements can be made for the first formal classroom<br/>observation. Pre-observation conferences, post-observation conferences and the final<br/>summary evaluation shall be scheduled appropriately.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Observations and Post-Observation Conferences</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each evaluation plan shall include a minimum of two (2) formal classroom<br/>observations, and shall be a minimum of thirty (30) minutes each. Prior to the first<br/>observation, the evaluator shall give the unit member at least two (2) days prior<br/>notice. Within five (5) days after each formal classroom observation, the evaluator<br/>will hold a post-observation conference. In addition to formal classroom<br/>observations, two documented informal observations of the unit member in the<br/>classroom shall take place for each summary evaluation year. With agreement of<br/>both unit member and the evaluator, the number of formal observations may be<br/>reduced from two (2) to one (1) and the number of informal observations may be<br/>reduced from two (2) to one (1).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For temporary and probationary unit members, the first formal classroom observation<br/>shall be conducted no later than the end of the third week of October, and the second<br/>will be conducted by the end of the first week of December. The third formal<br/>observation shall be conducted by the end of the first week in February, and the<br/>fourth by the end of the first week of April.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For permanent unit members, the first formal observation shall be conducted by the<br/>end of the first week of December, and the second observation by the end of the<br/>second week of April.</p>
<p>12.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Evaluation Summary</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All final evaluation conferences for permanent, temporary, and probationary unit<br/>members shall be completed by the end of the last week in April. The evaluator shall<br/>provide a copy to the unit member thirty (30) days prior to the end of the school year.<br/>All copies must be signed by the evaluator and the evaluatee.</p>
<p>1. The signing of the evaluation form by the evaluatee does not indicate<br/>concurrence. It does indicate that the evaluatee has seen the evaluation and that<br/>it has been discussed. The evaluation instrument provides a space for the<br/>response of the evaluatee to the assessment. Additional comments may be made<br/>on the form itself or on a separate sheet and submitted to the evaluator within ten<br/>(10) workdays.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it becomes apparent the evaluatee will receive an overall “Practice Not<br/>Consistent With Minimum Standards: Unsatisfactory’ on the Summary Evaluation<br/>Form, the evaluator shall hold a conference to notify the evaluatee at least four (4)<br/>weeks prior to the issuance of the Summary Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee shall have the right to initiate a written response to the evaluation<br/>within ten (10) working days of the Summary Evaluation Report and the evaluator<br/>shall schedule a second conference to discuss the concerns. The evaluatee’s response<br/>shall become a permanent attachment to the evaluatee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee feels the evaluation is unjustified, he/she may, within ten (10)<br/>workdays of the second evaluation conference, elect to request the Superintendent or<br/>designee to review his/her performance evaluation record. In such event the<br/>employee shall present to the evaluator, in writing, his/her objections to the<br/>evaluation record and submit a copy to the Superintendent or designee. At the<br/>employee’s request, a copy of these objections shall be attached to the evaluation and<br/>become a part of the evaluation record. Also, a review by the Superintendent or<br/>designee of the procedures utilized and the results of a classroom visitation, if<br/>possible, will be put in writing and attached to the evaluation.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings, recommendations, and/or decisions of the Superintendent or designee<br/>shall be final regarding the evaluation itself unless it can be determined that the<br/>evaluation procedure contained herein has not been properly followed.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedural Appeals: A grievance may be filed according to Article 6 (Grievance<br/>Procedure) should an employee contend that the evaluator has failed to follow the<br/>procedure for evaluation as contained herein. The disputed evaluation shall be<br/>destroyed in the event that is determined through the grievance procedure that the<br/>evaluator did not follow the evaluation procedures provided in this Agreement.</p>
<p>12.8. Alternative Evaluation</p>
<p>The District and FCEA share the belief that offering alternatives to the traditional evaluation<br/>system will improve instructional practices by promoting the professional growth of<br/>experienced teachers.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All permanent certificated employees who have received a satisfactory rating<br/>on their last three (3) formal evaluations with FCUSD will qualify for an<br/>alternative evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative evaluation option, when mutually agreed upon, shall take the<br/>place of the traditional evaluation methods as outlined in this Article.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal Setting</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee will develop goals based on the CSTP’s as the<br/>foundation for the alternative evaluation option.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the goal setting conference, taking place no later than the end of the<br/>sixth week of school, the evaluator and the evaluatee will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree on the goals and the selection of the alternative evaluation<br/>option.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop timelines for completion.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review how the alternative evaluation option will enhance student<br/>learning.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative Evaluation Options</p>
<p>The certificated employee should select an alternative evaluation option that will be<br/>in close alignment with his/her goals. The alternative evaluation options listed below<br/>are self evaluations, peer evaluations, and projects.</p>
<p>1. Individual Growth Activities:</p>
<p>Individual growth activities are designed to improve the employee’s</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>performance through the use of selected professional growth activities<br/>combined with self-analysis techniques. Examples of activities in this<br/>category include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Videotaping a classroom lesson with self analysis</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portfolio assessments</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self gathering of classroom evidence for reflection</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student and parent feedback</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher created projects</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Growth Activiti e s:</p>
<p>These activities are often designed to reduce the isolation of the classroom<br/>teacher. The District and FCEA encourage professional collaboration as a<br/>valuable professional growth tool for all employees. Examples of activities<br/>in this category include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formative coaching using the CSTP’s</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Videotaping lessons with peer review</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter-disciplinary (grade levels and/or subject areas) teams</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer classroom visitations</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative teaching</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team teacher created projects</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presentations to other staff</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Based and/or Educational Research Activities:</p>
<p>The teacher may outline an instructional strategy or learning theory to be<br/>researched and implemented in the classroom. The design of the research<br/>and method of assessment shall be included in the project plan. This may be<br/>done in conjunction with graduate course work or a District curriculum<br/>project if there is a direct connection to enhancing student performance.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and FCEA believe the most effective professional growth occurs</p>
<p>through collaboration.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and evaluator will work together in the selection of the<br/>option and the development of specific activities.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants will be encouraged to share the progress and results of<br/>their alternative individual or educational team activities with other<br/>colleagues. The time and format of this collaboration will be developed<br/>at each individual site.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines</p>
<p>The certificated employee will submit a written alternative evaluation plan. Written<br/>timelines are to be predetermined by the employee and the evaluator.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Report</p>
<p>Prior to the end of the school year, the teacher and evaluator will meet to review and<br/>the progress of the selected teacher activities. Both the teacher and the administrator<br/>will provide a written response. Upon satisfactory completion of the selected<br/>activities, a summary evaluation form will be used to indicate the completion of the<br/>alternative evaluation option and this form will be entered in the personnel file.<br/>12.9 Miscellaneous Provisions Related to Employee Evaluations.</p>

<p>This MOU is intended to reduce the current work year specified in Appendix E-3 from 184 work<br/>days to 181 work days for the 2011-2012 school year. These days will allow the District to<br/>rescind lay-off notices for the number of Full-time Equivalents (FTE’s) equal to or greater than<br/>the savings generated by the reduction in work year ($1,221,000). Pending ratification by both<br/>parties, the District and FCEA agree to the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year for all bargaining members shall be reduced by three (3) work days. The work<br/>year for regular (non-factored) certificated personnel shall be one hundred seventy-eight (178)<br/>teaching days plus three (3) additional days for a total of one hundred eighty-one (181) days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated personnel positions listed in Appendix B shall have their number of work days<br/>reduced by three (3) days. Their ratio factor shall be maintained.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rendering service on one hundred eighty-one (181) days shall constitute a full year of service<br/>and will be reported to STRS as a full year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-day reduction shall be effected by eliminating three (3) student days. An amended<br/>school calendar for 2011-2012 will be agreed to by both parties.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2011-2012 school year, the 2008-2009 salary schedule shall be maintained, but only<br/>one hundred eighty-one (181) days shall be paid.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to these FCEA concessions, the District shall provide re-employment for the 2011-2012<br/>school year for no less than sixteen (16) certificated employees who were issued Reduction in<br/>Force notices in March of 2011 or in previous years. The total compensation for the restored<br/>positions shall be equal to or greater than $1,221,000.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to or during the 2011-12 school year, if the District receives any additional federal<br/>revenue over 2010-2011 amounts (excluding federal Title dollars) or state revenue in excess of<br/>the 2010-2011 Base Revenue Limit Per ADA, then fifty percent (50%) of such revenue that is<br/>not specifically restricted by law from being used for certificated salaries shall be directed<br/>toward restoring 2011-12 furlough days until all furlough days are restored. Upon receipt of said<br/>revenues, each $814,000 funding increase shall restore a furlough day with the corresponding<br/>salary increase for the 2011-12 school year until all three (3) furlough days are restored. In order<br/>to be paid for a restored furlough day, an additional instructional day shall be restored.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the 2011-12 Base Revenue Limit per student is less than 2010-11 BRL by more than $19<br/>per student, then FCEA and District shall reopen negotiations for 2011-12.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This MOU shall only be effective for the 2011-2012 school year. When this MOU expires, the<br/>current contract language regarding any topic or issue addressed in this MOU shall prevail.</p>

<p>GUIDELINES FOR ELEMENTARY PREP TIME</p>
<p>SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prep time is a professional time to prepare for teaching, communicating with parents,<br/>collaboration, etc. Prep time is not for personal business.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a teacher need to leave the campus, he/she must notify the site<br/>administrator/designee.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curriculum:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Original 60 Minutes</p>
<p>The three (3) curriculum areas to be considered are music, art, and physical education.<br/>Any curriculum change and appropriate staff notifications must be completed prior to<br/>March 1<sup>st</sup> of the school year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Additional 40 Minutes</p>
<p>The District shall determine the curriculum for the additional 40 minutes provided to 4-6<br/>classroom teachers.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minutes Per Week:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of 60 minutes per week of prep time will be provided for each self-<br/>contained classroom teacher in grades K through 3. Self-contained classroom teachers in<br/>grades 4-6 shall receive 100 minutes per week. This assumes a five (5) day work week.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will establish and maintain a ratio of 1:24 - one elementary specialist teacher<br/>for every 24 eligible teachers (regular, newcomers’ class, and self-contained SDC) for<br/>the original 60 minutes. The ratio for the additional 40 minutes shall be 1:32.</p>
<p>If, at a particular school site, this ratio is inadequate to provide the elementary prep time<br/>in the allocated amount stated above, then adjustments will be considered on a case-by-<br/>case basis.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialists that travel to multiple sites will be scheduled to no more than nine sections<br/>each day, or the number that will allow adequate travel time.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other contract language on class size applies to specialists.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School/Site Decision Making:</p>
<p>A. As a new elementary school opens, those classroom teachers at each school will come to<br/>consensus regarding the subject area(s) to be covered by the specialist teacher. If a</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>specialist teacher teaches at more than one site, consensus between schools will<br/>determine the subject area(s) taught by the specialist. Notification will be made to the<br/>Personnel Department.</p>
<p>B. Paragraph A does not apply to the additional 40 minutes for self-contained classroom<br/>teachers in grades 4-6.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Classes/Aides:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each SDC class at the school site may be combined with an appropriate regular class<br/>based on IEP and in consultation with the site administrator. The SDC class at<br/>Reymouth will be an exception. The specialist teacher assigned to Cordova Villa will<br/>cover the SDC class at Reymouth as a separate class. All SDC aides must go with the<br/>class during the SDC teacher’s prep time to assist with the SDC students.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newcomers’ class teachers will be scheduled for prep time just as a regular classroom<br/>teacher is scheduled. Aides who are scheduled to the newcomers’ class during prep will<br/>remain with the class to assist the teacher providing prep time.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support personnel who do not teach self-contained classes do not receive prep time<br/>(speech pathologists, psychologists, resource specialist program teachers, ESEA resource<br/>teachers, etc.).</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESEA aides, Transitional English aides, etc., who are assigned to a class during that<br/>teacher’s prep time will remain with the class to assist the specialist teacher.</p>
<p>VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduling of Classes:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist teachers will develop a schedule which allows each classroom teacher in<br/>grades K-3 a minimum of 60 minutes per week and each classroom teacher in grades 4-6<br/>a minimum of 100 minutes per week. Site administrators will review and approve the<br/>schedule. Schedules for minimum and super minimum days must also be developed, as<br/>prep time will occur according to a pro-rated shortened schedule, except specialists that<br/>travel to more than one school on a single day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prep time schedule will be developed first and take priority over individual<br/>classroom schedules and all other schedules except music and universal access. Prep<br/>time will not be scheduled during a classroom teacher’s recess or lunch period. (The bell<br/>schedule may need to be modified to accommodate the prep schedule. Someone will be<br/>scheduled for prep time throughout the teaching day, from beginning to end, in most<br/>cases.)</p>
<p>Suggestions: Perhaps the best time to schedule prep for the SDC teacher is when the<br/>greatest number of students are already mainstreamed. That way, the least number of<br/>SDC students will join an appropriate regular class. All SDC aides must go with the<br/>class during the SDC teacher’s prep time to assist with the SDC students.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher’s prep time falls on a holiday or non-student day, the prep time for that day is<br/>not rescheduled. Prep schedules will not be changed for individual teacher needs (i.e.,<br/>field trips, classroom teacher absence, special programs.)</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers assigned a Monday or Friday prep time schedule during one school year will<br/>not be scheduled the following year for a Monday or Friday schedule. Monday-Friday<br/>prep time schedules need to rotate through staff members for equity because of the<br/>number of holidays and non-student days which fall on Mondays or Fridays. (This does<br/>not mean that schools with staff turnover always assign the newer teachers to a Monday-<br/>Friday schedule and senior teachers never take a turn at a Monday or Friday schedule.)</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist teachers will be selected and ready for prep to start by the first day of school.<br/>Classroom teachers and specialist teachers may mutually agree when to start prep at a<br/>later date. As adjustments in the number of classes assigned to school are made,<br/>schedules will be adjusted.</p>
<p>Recommendation: That classroom teachers and specialist teachers work jointly to<br/>establish clear expectations and procedures for students.</p>
<p>VII. Specialist Teachers:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specialist teacher is responsible under the FCEA teachers’ contract to be at his/her<br/>site for work fifteen (15) minutes before and fifteen (15) minutes after the students’<br/>instructional day. Part-time specialist teachers will add fifteen (15) minutes before and<br/>after their prorated day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist teachers will not be scheduled for any recess/bus supervision duties. Should<br/>an emergency situation arise, specialist teachers may be assigned supervision duties on<br/>an equitable basis.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist teachers will have the same number of minutes, not to include transition time,<br/>for lunch and recess breaks as the classroom teachers at the site.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist teachers will coordinate with site administrators to attend an equitable number<br/>of staff meetings, non-student in-service days, District in-service days, etc., comparable<br/>to regular classroom teachers.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist teachers who are assigned to YRE schools will work an equivalent number of<br/>teacher days as a classroom YRE teacher, with the option of extending up to a total of<br/>228 teaching days. A substitute will be secured if the teacher does not opt to extend<br/>his/her contract.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specialist teacher is responsible for short-term and long-term planning and lesson<br/>planning comparable to classroom teachers.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the specialist teacher is absent, substitutes will be secured in the same manner as<br/>for a regular classroom teacher. When a full day substitute is secured for a less than full<br/>time specialist teacher, the site administrator will assign the substitute teacher<br/>responsibilities for a full day of work.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During assemblies or special programs that interrupt the regular schedule, the specialist<br/>teacher is responsible for the students of his/her assigned class at that assembly, etc. The<br/>classroom teacher receives prep time.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrator is responsible for the evaluation of non-traveling specialist<br/>teachers. If a specialist teacher teaches at more than one site, those administrators need<br/>to determine each year which one is the primary evaluator, with input from the other(s).<br/>Each administrator will share the observation portion of the evaluation. Specialists<br/>assigned to multiple sites with a district-wide administrator may be evaluated by the<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialists who travel between sites will have fewer classes based on travel time.</p>
<p>VIII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeliness:</p>
<p>Each classroom teacher is responsible for delivering the students at the scheduled time to the<br/>specialist and being ready to receive his/her students at the end of the prep schedule. Should<br/>tardiness occur, lost prep time is not made up.</p>
<p>Each specialist is responsible for receiving and returning the students to the classroom<br/>teacher at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>IX. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplies and Equipment:</p>
<p>Supplies and equipment for specialist teachers providing prep time are funded through the<br/>site’s budget and any other monies available to that school (SIP, PTA, grants, etc.) Monies<br/>should be budgeted for specialist teachers using the same process as for classroom teachers.</p>
<p>X. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilities:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority usage of the multi, playground areas, and equipment for the specialist should be<br/>coordinated and calendared in advance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administrators shall develop a “rainy day” plan for specialist teacher use of facilities.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School sites shall provide access to a computer, and attempt to provide a desk and<br/>identified work area for the specialists. Schools need to provide a safe place for the<br/>specialist teacher to keep personal effects. Appropriate and safe storage will be provided<br/>for instructional materials.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classroom teacher may choose to work in the classroom during their prep time.</p>

<p>MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL PLANNING TIME</p>
<p>SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>This Side Letter of Understanding is mutually agreed to by the Folsom Cordova Unified School<br/>District and Folsom Cordova Education Association.</p>
<p>In order to provide all staff at the middle and high schools a weekly opportunity for common<br/>planning time (CPT), this agreement has been initiated.</p>
<p>The CPT is designed to permit staff the opportunity to implement the programs connected with<br/>restructuring activities, to coordinate WASC activities, plan, develop, and implement the latest<br/>research guidelines for best practices, and to provide articulation among Middle Schools and High<br/>School departments to develop instructional continuum.</p>
<p>The length of the common planning day will not exceed the number of minutes in a regular school<br/>day.</p>
<p>The CPT at the high school levels will include regular staff, division, WASC, and collaboration<br/>meetings. (Executive Council meetings will not be included in CPT.) Meetings held outside of<br/>school hours henceforth will be on a volunteer basis, unless such unforeseen circumstances require<br/>such a meeting.</p>
<p>The CPT at the middle school levels will be utilized to incorporate ideas from the latest research on<br/>middle school instruction, allow time for teachers to plan collaboratively, and do other activities as<br/>needed to improve school functioning, and shall, based on consent by both the site administrator and<br/>middle school staff, include periodic or regular staff meetings..</p>
<p>At the high school level, a minimum day will be scheduled for the Back-to-School Night and Open<br/>House if either is scheduled. Every attempt will be made to schedule a minimum day whenever<br/>teachers are required to attend similar after school activities.</p>
<p>At the middle school level, the sites will determine day placement.</p>
<p>Teachers will be given relief from either the fifteen (15) minutes before school or the fifteen (15)<br/>minutes after school contract requirement as a compensation for the longer work week requirement<br/>of CPT.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>Signed: 8/22/06<br/>Updated 1/12/2010</p>
<p>SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The purpose of this side letter is to address and clarify the “typical” middle school daily schedule.<br/>Currently, all middle schools use a six period “academic” class schedule as well as an additional<br/>Homeroom/Advisory period.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the “typical” six academic periods:</p>
<p>Article 10.1.B is still in effect where there is a maximum of 175 daily student contacts for<br/>academic classes and a maximum of 200 daily student contacts for the P.E. and elective<br/>classes.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Homeroom/Advisory period:</p>
<p>This period is designed to foster close personal relationships with students to develop social<br/>and academic skills as described in Chapter 5, page 100, in Taking Center Stage, the<br/>California Department of Education Guide for Middle Schools. It is shorter than other<br/>periods. It is not graded. It does not include a required curriculum. This time is outside of<br/>the daily student contact restriction.</p>

<p>Appendix F-5</p>
<p>USE OF CURRENT SECONDARY AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STAFF<br/>FOR SUBSTITUTE TEACHING DURING THEIR PREP PERIOD OR DAY</p>
<p>SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The purpose of this side letter is to provide compensation for elementary teachers who have been<br/>assigned additional students when a substitute is not available, and any comprehensive secondary<br/>school teacher who has been assigned to cover a class period based on Article 8.12 3. In addition to<br/>the contract language regarding this issue, the following provisions will be included:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make every effort to provide substitute teachers.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers assigned to cover for a missing substitute on their prep period will be<br/>determined first from a volunteer list established, by period and by site. If no volunteers<br/>are available, then assignments will be made from other available teachers on a fair and<br/>equitable basis.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a teacher has covered five (5) periods for a missing substitute, compensation will<br/>be made in the amount of the daily regular fully credentialed substitute teacher rate. If<br/>there are less than five (5) periods covered at the end of the school year, then each<br/>teacher will be compensated at a prorated amount based on the number of periods<br/>assigned.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a school is on a “block” schedule, then an equivalent number of periods (typically two)<br/>will be credited to a teacher who is assigned to take a class on a block schedule day.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For schools on a “4x4” schedule, once a teacher has covered three (3) periods for a<br/>missing substitute, compensation will be made in the amount of the daily substitute rate.<br/>If there are less than three (3) periods covered at the end of the school year, then each<br/>teacher will be compensated at a prorated amount based on the number of periods<br/>assigned.</p>
<p>In addition to the contract language regarding this issue, during the 2006-07 school year, the<br/>following provisions for elementary teachers will be included:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every two occurrences of coverage of up to 12 students in elementary grades K-6 for<br/>a missing substitute, compensation will be made in the amount of the daily regular fully<br/>credentialed substitute rate.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation will be made in the amount of one-half of the daily regular fully<br/>credentialed substitute rate in the case of a single occurrence.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incremental secondary provisions will be provided for elementary teachers assigned<br/>if the substitute for a music, PE, or art teacher is not available.</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has permanent status</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been employed by the school District for at least 10 years or an employee with the<br/>District for 8 years with a minimum of 12 years credentialed teaching experience</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meets the federal definition of highly qualified (if those employees occupy positions that are<br/>required to be filled by a highly qualified professional by the federal No Child Left Behind<br/>Act of 2001 [20U.S.C. Sec. 6301, etseq.], as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801) and meets all<br/>state credentialing and certification requirements</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has met or exceeded standards in the previous evaluation or has successfully completed an<br/>alternative evaluation project</p>
<p>The unit member or administrator may opt out of this evaluation option at any time.</p>

<p>TRANSFER RELATED TO THE CLOSING OF A SCHOOL</p>
<p>THE FOLSOM CORDOVA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>AND THE</p>
<p>FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>FOR THE PERIOD OF JULY 1, 2009 TO JUNE 30, 2010</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding is intended to provide more specific procedures in<br/>conjunction with, and supersedes where in conflict with, Article 11.4 (Transfer Related to<br/>Closing of a School).</p>
<p>Unit members from Riverview shall be given first priority to select, by seniority order, new<br/>classroom vacancies created by students moving from Riverview to Peter J. Shields<br/>Elementary School. Unit members from Cordova Lane shall be given first priority to select,<br/>by seniority order, new classroom vacancies created by students moving from Cordova Lane<br/>to Rancho Cordova and Williamson Elementary Schools and other schools. New classroom<br/>vacancies created by receiving students from closed schools will be identified by class and<br/>grade level.</p>
<p>Unit members from closed schools shall select from available vacancies created by school<br/>closures prior to the assignment of surplus teachers and new hires. Unit members at<br/>receiving schools will not have priority and will not be assigned to vacant positions created<br/>by receiving additional students from closed schools until all teachers from closed schools<br/>have been reassigned or have elected to voluntarily be included as a surplus teacher.</p>
<p>If there are fewer vacancies created as a result of combining schools, those teachers without<br/>positions will be included as a surplus teacher to determine placement for the 2010-2011<br/>school year. Teachers may voluntarily elect to enter the surplus pool limited to the number of<br/>surplus positions created by the closing of schools.</p>
<p>Teachers with shared contracts will be listed and will select from available vacancies based<br/>on their individual seniority status.</p>
<p>If specialized programs such as FLES (Foreign Language Elementary School) and<br/>Elementary Opportunity, are continued and move intact, existing assigned certificated staff<br/>shall move with the program.</p>
<p>Teachers of special education classes that do not remain intact, because the District is able to<br/>reassign those students into existing programs, shall be assigned to vacancies in their<br/>appropriate credential areas as determined by Student Support Services. If multiple vacancies<br/>exist district-wide, displaced teachers shall be given the opportunity to select by seniority<br/>order.</p>
<p>Elementary prep specialists are considered itinerant and shall continue to be assigned based<br/>on credentials and site allocations by the Coordinator of Music, Visual and Performing Arts<br/>and P.E. for the 2010-2011 school year.</p>

<p>THE FOLSOM CORDOVA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>AND THE</p>
<p>FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>FOR THE PERIOD OF JULY 1, 2009 TO JUNE 30, 2011</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding is intended to provide specific daily contact maximums<br/>for schools operating on an eight-period instructional schedule.</p>
<p>Secondary teachers with an 8-period day shall have a maximum of 185 daily student<br/>contacts, with the exception of music and physical education teachers whose maximum daily<br/>contacts will not exceed 215. Secondary teachers with three double period blocks shall have<br/>a maximum of 105 daily student contacts. For a combination of single and double periods,<br/>the following maximums shall not be exceeded:</p>
<p>158 daily contacts for 1 double period and 4 single periods (Excluding PE and music)</p>
<p>132 daily contacts for 2 double periods and 2 single periods (Excluding PE and music)</p>
<p>Individual teachers may agree to exceed their maximum student contacts to meet their<br/>individual program needs. Less than full time teachers, or teachers with combined student<br/>maximums, will be assigned student maximums on a proportional basis. Individual class<br/>maximums will not exceed established safety maximums previously authorized by the fire<br/>department and the District’s insurance providers.</p>
<p>Individual class sizes shall not exceed 35 students per class, with the exception of math and<br/>English double period blocks which shall not exceed 37 students per class, and music and<br/>physical education class sizes which shall not exceed 40 students per class. During the first<br/>two weeks of instruction of each trimester/semester, class sizes may exceed the maximums<br/>in order to balance and finalize the master schedule. An exception to these limits will only<br/>occur if the following requirements are met:</p>
<p>The administrator makes every effort to reduce the class size by the start of the third<br/>week of the trimester/semester.</p>
<p>The administrator has contacted the assigned teacher to discuss the reason for the<br/>class size and the timeline for reducing to the appropriate maximum contacts within<br/>the semester/trimester.</p>
<p>Students in excess of the maximum contacts are distributed evenly and on a rotating<br/>basis among the subject matter teachers.</p>

<p>ELEMENTARY GRADES 1-2 PREP</p>
<p>THE FOLSOM CORDOVA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>AND THE</p>
<p>FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>FCEA and the District agree that the amount of preparation time should be consistent for teachers in<br/>elementary schools in grades one through six. With the loss of “class size reduction” at first and<br/>second grades there is support for an additional 40 minutes of preparation for first and second grade<br/>teachers. The District would like a solution for Grades 1-2 elementary prep that is sustainable<br/>beyond 2011-12 and does not contribute to the current budget shortfall for 2011-12. Therefore both<br/>parties agree to the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and second grade teachers will receive the additional forty minutes of preparation time<br/>for the 2011-12 school year. This will be accomplished by designating one day each week as<br/>an all early day. The selection of the day of the week will be at the discretion of the District<br/>and may not be same for all schools.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and second grade teachers will be compensated for the additional 40 minutes of prep<br/>time for the 2010-11 school year according to a compromise agreement between FCEA and<br/>the District. First and second grade teachers will be compensated with a onetime payment of<br/>three hundred eighty-five dollars and seventeen cents ($385.17).</p>
