<p>5.1 Transfer/Reassignment</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer/Reassignment” refers to any change in the permanent<br/>assignment of unit members from one site to a different site. A vacancy<br/>is any position to which a unit member is not assigned. This includes<br/>any vacated, promotional, or newly created position, including positions<br/>created by reconfiguration or restructuring.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon knowledge of vacancies, the District shall deliver to the<br/>Association and post in all school buildings a list of all vacancies which<br/>occur during the school year and for the following school year. The list<br/>shall contain the following: A closing date which is at least five (5)<br/>working days following the posting date; a job description; credentials<br/>and qualifications necessary to meet the requirements of the position.<br/>No assignment to fill a vacancy shall be made until after the closing<br/>date. The District shall, upon request by a unit member, notify that unit<br/>member by mail of any posted openings which may arise during the<br/>summer recess or a period of leave. The unit member’s request must<br/>be in writing and must include a mailing address. If a unit member<br/>already has a transfer application on file, it is not necessary to make a<br/>further application in order to be considered for any vacancies. The<br/>District shall, upon request of the unit member, deliver in writing, the<br/>reasons for the unit member not receiving the vacancy. No outside<br/>applicant shall be selected to fill a vacancy if there is a qualified unit<br/>member applicant.</p>

<p>SMJUHSD</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>FA Contract 12/11/09</p>
<p>statement of such desire with the Personnel Office. Such statement<br/>shall include the grade and/or subject to which the unit member desires<br/>to be assigned, and the school or schools to which the unit member<br/>desires to be transferred/reassigned.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, and as soon as practical, the District shall make<br/>available to the Association a list of all unit members who have been<br/>transferred/reassigned. The District shall not be required to furnish such<br/>a list more than once in any given school year, unless further<br/>transfer/reassignments occur, then upon request.</p>
<p>5.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may submit a request(s) for transfer to the District each<br/>academic year on the District Transfer Form, whether or not a vacancy<br/>exists. A unit member may also submit a request for a transfer<br/>subsequent to the posting of a vacancy notice pursuant to the posting<br/>procedure of this Article. If two (2) or more unit members with the<br/>required credentials and equal qualifications relating to the job<br/>description for the position apply for a vacancy, the unit member with<br/>the greatest seniority shall receive the transfer. If a unit member’s<br/>request for a voluntary transfer is denied, the unit member, upon<br/>request, shall be granted a meeting with the administrator who denied<br/>the request to discuss the reasons for the denial. Following the meeting<br/>the unit member may request and shall receive written reasons for the<br/>denial. If the unit member requests that his/her application for transfer<br/>be kept confidential, only the Principal at his/her school shall be notified<br/>by the District of the application. Unit members returning from leave<br/>shall be afforded all rights provided under this section. If there is a</p>
<p>21</p>

<p>qualified volunteer for a vacant position, the position cannot be filled by<br/>an involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>5.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfer/reassignment shall be made only for the following<br/>reasons: A decrease in the number of pupils which requires a decrease<br/>in the number of unit members, class size, elimination of program (s)<br/>and/or funding, or school closings. If a decrease in the number of pupils<br/>or the elimination of program(s) and/or funding occurs, the District shall<br/>seek volunteers prior to making any involuntary transfer/reassignment.<br/>If an involuntary transfer/reassignment becomes necessary, the unit<br/>member with the least seniority with the appropriate credential shall be<br/>transferred and/or reassigned. An involuntary transfer/reassignment<br/>shall be made only after a conference with the unit member involved.<br/>The unit member may elect to have a representative of the Association<br/>present at the conference.</p>
<p>5.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices of involuntary transfer/reassignment shall be given in writing to the<br/>unit members as soon as practical.

<p>14.1 Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>14.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may<br/>arise concerning the application of the Agreement.</p>
<p>14.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Problem Solving</p>
<p>14.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days after a grievant (See Appendix D)<br/>knew, or should have known, of the act or condition upon<br/>which a problem is based, the grievant shall discuss the<br/>matter in an informal conference with the immediate<br/>supervisor (See Appendix D) in an attempt to resolve the<br/>problem. However, resolution of problems in such informal<br/>conferences shall not be binding upon the parties in<br/>subsequent grievances.</p>
<p>14.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>14.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I: If the matter is not resolved at the informal<br/>conference, the grievant may submit the grievance in<br/>writing to the immediate supervisor with a copy to the<br/>Association and to the Superintendent. The written<br/>grievance will be submitted on a District form and shall<br/>include:</p>
<p>14.1.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the grievant.</p>
<p>14.1.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the provision(s) of the Agreement<br/>alleged to have been violated.</p>
<p>14.1.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement describing how the District is</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>SMJUHSD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract 12/11 /09</p>
<p>alleged to have violated the Agreement<br/>(including all names, dates, and places<br/>necessary for a complete understanding of the<br/>grievance), the decision rendered as a result of<br/>informal problem solving and the remedy<br/>sought. This written statement of the grievance<br/>must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after<br/>the occurrence of the act or condition giving<br/>rise to the grievance. The immediate<br/>supervisor shall present a written response to<br/>the grievant within (10) days of receiving the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>14.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II: If the grievance is not settled in Level I and if the<br/>immediate supervisor is subordinate to a site administrator,<br/>the grievant may appeal it to such site administrator. The<br/>site Administrator shall submit a written response within<br/>(10) days of receiving the grievance. If the immediate<br/>supervisor is the site administrator (See Appendix D), the<br/>grievant may appeal it to the Superintendent. A Level II<br/>appeal shall be filed within (10) days of receipt by the<br/>grievant of the Level I denial or within (10) days of the<br/>Level I response deadline if the written response is not<br/>provided the grievance is denied.</p>
<p>14.1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III: If the grievance is not settled in Level II, the<br/>grievant may appeal it to the Superintendent. The appeal</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>SMJUHSD</p>
<p>shall be in writing and shall be submitted within ten (10)<br/>days after the grievant receives the site administrator’s<br/>written response. The appeal shall include a copy of the<br/>original grievance, the immediate supervisor’s response,<br/>and a statement of the reasons for the appeal. The<br/>Superintendent shall respond to the appeal in writing within<br/>ten (10) days after receipt. Either the grievant filing the<br/>grievance or the Superintendent may request a meeting to<br/>discuss the grievance within this ten (10) day period. If<br/>such meeting is held, the time limit for submission of the<br/>Superintendent’s response shall be extended until five (5)<br/>days after such meeting.</p>
<p>14.1.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at<br/>the previous level or if there is no decision within the time<br/>limits, the grievant may, within ten (10) days of the receipt<br/>of the decision or the exhaustion of the time limits, request<br/>conciliation. The District shall then set a meeting with a<br/>conciliator from the California State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Service as soon as reasonably possible for all<br/>parties of interest (See Appendix D). If agreed by the<br/>Association and the District, the State Mediator may serve<br/>as Binding Arbitrator.</p>
<p>14.1.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level V: If Binding Arbitration is not agreed to in Level IV<br/>and the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of<br/>his/her grievance at level IV, or if no written decision has</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>SMJUHSD</p>
<p>been rendered within then (10) days after submission of<br/>the grievance to the Superintendent, the Association may<br/>within ten (10) days request in writing that the grievance be<br/>submitted to arbitration. The parties shall select a mutually<br/>acceptable arbitrator. Should they be unable to agree on<br/>an arbitrator within ten (10) days of the Association’s<br/>submission of the grievance to arbitration, submission of<br/>the grievance shall be made to the American Arbitration<br/>Association. In any event, the parties will then be bound by<br/>the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration<br/>Association in the selection of an arbitrator and the<br/>arbitrator shall proceed under the Voluntary Labor<br/>Arbitration Rules of said Association. The sole authority of<br/>the arbitrator shall be to decide whether there has been a<br/>violation of the Agreement and the appropriate remedy if<br/>there has been a violation. The arbitrator will be without<br/>power or authority to make any decision which requires the<br/>commission of an act prohibited by law or which violates<br/>the terms of this Agreement, or which alters or amends the<br/>terms of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator will<br/>be submitted to the Association and the Superintendent<br/>and will be binding upon the parties to this Agreement and<br/>the grievant(s).</p>
<p>14.1.3.6 All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not<br/>limited to, per diem expenses, his/her travel and<br/>73</p>

<p>APPENDIX F<br/>ADJUNCT DUTIES PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Definition: The negotiated adjunct duties are activities that allow students to be<br/>supervised by teachers in a non-curricular/non-instructional environment outside the<br/>normal work day without additional compensation.</p>
<p>Directions: The Principal’s welcome back letter will include a list of the negotiated<br/>adjunct duties supervised by bargaining unit members commencing with the 2009/10<br/>school year. A maximum number of two (2) events may be required of any bargaining<br/>unit member during an academic year. A bargaining unit member may volunteer for<br/>more than two events in an academic year. If a bargaining unit member does not sign<br/>up, he/she may be assigned supervision of adjunct duties.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity/Athletic Directors will make a calendar of the negotiated list of adjunct<br/>duties with events, dates, timeframes and locations.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletic Directors may allow bargaining unit members to sign up for specialized<br/>needs (e.g. timers, etc.) before presenting the list to staff.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendars of adjunct duties will be posted for sign ups during the first two<br/>contractual days of the school year at predetermined locations.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity/Athletic Directors will review the calendars and identify open adjunct<br/>duties. The first four days of the second week of school, a list of open adjunct<br/>duties will be posted at a designated location for the second opportunity to sign<br/>up.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the third week of school, the Principal will review the calendar and<br/>determine any open adjunct duties. If any openings remain, the Principal will<br/>conduct a meeting to provide all bargaining unit members, who have not signed<br/>up, with the third and final opportunity to volunteer for adjunct duties.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If after the third opportunity to sign up there are any remaining open adjunct<br/>duties, then any bargaining unit member who has not volunteered may be<br/>assigned to those openings during the fourth week by a lottery system to fill the<br/>vacancies in a chronological order. The Principal and an Association designee<br/>will conduct the lottery.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negotiated adjunct duty list and the procedures will be revisited periodically<br/>by the Faculty Association and District negotiating teams.</p>
