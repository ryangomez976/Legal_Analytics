Serious offenses include, but are not limited to, cases involving gross<br/>misconduct, or conduct that constitutes a threat or hazard to other persons.

No unit member<br/>will be suspended more than ten (10) working days during a school year<br/>for any single incident of misconduct. In all instances, however, the<br/>length of a suspension will relate to the severity of the action.</p>
<p>21.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice: The following process shall be followed in imposing unpaid disciplinary suspensions:</p>
<p>21.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the imposition of a suspension under this Article, the bargaining unit member<br/>shall be given written notice of the proposed disciplinary action and the cause(s)<br/>thereof.

<p>21.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member may appeal the proposed suspension by filing a written<br/>appeal with the Superintendent or designee within ten (10) working days after the<br/>bargaining unit member is given or mailed a copy of the written notice.

Level V (Arbitration Level). At arbitration, the just cause for earlier<br/>discipline may be determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>21.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to timely request arbitration, the Association must request arbitration by<br/>delivering written notice of appeal to the Superintendent with ten (10) working days<br/>after receipt of the notice of suspension. If the Association does not demand arbitration<br/>within the above timeline, the suspension without pay may be imposed immediately by<br/>the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>21.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality: All information or proceedings regarding any actions or proposed actions<br/>pursuant to the Article will be kept confidential by the parties to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>21.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Code: This Article is intended, for the purpose of suspension, to replace the<br/>provisions of Education Code Section 44944, but, will not apply to suspension pursuant to<br/>Education Code Sections 44939, 44940 or 44942.
