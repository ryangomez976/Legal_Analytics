<p>8.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;District Grievance Form” shall mean a District provided form.</p>
<p>GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the procedure is to attempt to secure equitable solutions to<br/>grievances. All parties agree that these proceedings should be kept informal and<br/>confidential, and that the grievant and immediate supervisor should attempt to<br/>resolve the grievance at the informal level.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the Board to<br/>proceed in carrying out its management responsibilities subject to a final decision<br/>on the grievance. In the event the grievance claim involves an order,<br/>requirement, or other directive, the grievant shall fulfil! or carry out such order,<br/>requirement or other directive, pending a final decision on the grievance.</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any grievant<br/>to discuss a grievance informally with the immediate supervisor, or to have the<br/>grievance adjusted, prior to Level ill without the intervention of the Association,<br/>provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.<br/>Any proposed resolution at Levels I or II shall not be agreed upon by the district<br/>until the Association has been provided a copy, and allowed an opportunity to<br/>respond.</p>

<p>8.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a specific time period is provided for administrative decisions at each<br/>level of the grievance procedure, it is recognized that multiple grievance claims<br/>must be processed in a sequential manner. Consequently, at each level of the<br/>procedure, grievance claims shall be assigned consecutive numbers, following a<br/>pattern that first filed will be first considered.

<p>16.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees can use up to 20 additional days from their accrued sick leave (for<br/>personal necessity) to care for an immediate family member when a<br/>catastrophic event (serious illness or injury) necessitates the immediate<br/>attention of the employee. Additional days of catastrophic leave, up to accrued<br/>sick leave, shall be granted by the Personnel Office when a catastrophic event<br/>extends beyond 20 days providing that the criteria of this section is met. Prior<br/>to the extension of this leave, bargaining unit members will be counseled by the<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Personnel. Leaves of this type will only be granted<br/>in increments of 20 days. Requests for catastrophic leave should be called in<br/>to the employee’s immediate supervisor or the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Personnel stating reason for request. A written request for this leave needs to<br/>be sent to the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel within five (5) working<br/>days from the day the leave was taken.</p>
<p>16.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave/Donated Time - TCTA and the Tulare City School District<br/>establish Catastrophic Leave/Donated Time with the following provisions:</p>
<p>16.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness or injury” means an illness or injury:</p>
<p>16.5.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is expected to incapacitate the receiving employee<br/>for an extended period of time beyond the employee’s<br/>paid leave entitlement, or</p>
<p>16.5.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that incapacitates a member of the receiving employee’s<br/>immediate family, which incapacity requires the<br/>employee to take unpaid time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time to care for that family member,<br/>and</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>2014-2017</p>
<p>16.5.2.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which would create a financial hardship for the receiving<br/>employee if he/she were required to take extended time<br/>off work because he/she has exhausted ail of his/her sick<br/>leave and other paid time off, including up to five (5)<br/>months of differential pay/50% pay.</p>
<p>16.5.2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences due to a work-related illness or injury shall not<br/>qualify for use of catastrophic leave.</p>
<p>16.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Article 111, Section 3.3 for the definition of “Immediate family”.</p>
<p>16.5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may donate up to the current year's entitlement of sick</p>

<p>16.5.2.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated sick leave shall be converted for utilization on<br/>a hour for hour basis meaning the recipient shall be<br/>paid at his/her regular rate of pay.</p>
<p>16.5.2.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tulare City School District will credit the receiving</p>
<p>employee's sick leave account with one day of sick</p>
<p>leave from each donating employee in the order in</p>
<p>which the donation is received by the Tulare City</p>
<p>School District, and will repeat the process until the</p>
<p>receiving employee has received the maximum amount<br/>35 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-2017</p>
<p>Tulare City TA</p>
<p>of sick leave credit that he/she needs or may accrue<br/>under 16.5.2.4. If, through the initial process of<br/>deducting one day of sick leave credit from each<br/>donating employee, the receiving employee does not<br/>receive sufficient sick leave credit, the Tulare City<br/>School District shall repeat the process by crediting the<br/>receiving employee’s account with additional sick leave<br/>credits from those employees who wish to donate more<br/>than one day of sick leave credit.</p>
<p>16.5.2.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may not revoke their donation of sick leave</p>
<p>credits. Nevertheless, donated leave not utilized by the<br/>recipient prior to return to service shall be returned to<br/>the donor.</p>
<p>16.5.2.4 The maximum days allowed to be utilized by one employee shall not<br/>exceed his/her normal annual work year.</p>
<p>16.5.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are granted the use of donated leave days shall be<br/>considered to be in regular paid status and will continue to earn and<br/>accrue all contractual and statutory benefits.</p>
<p>16.5.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To utilize this benefit, an employee of.the Tulare City School District<br/>or TCTA may submit a request to the Superintendent to “call for<br/>donations.”</p>
<p>16.5.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent will grant approval of a catastrophic leave<br/>request to an employee if the employee’s or his/her family member’s<br/>illness or injury conforms to the definition of catastrophic illness or</p>

<p>36</p>
<p>2014-2017</p>
<p>injury set forth in this section and the individual’s condition is verified<br/>by a physician’s written statement.</p>

<p>16.5.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee returning from catastrophic leave will be reinstated to<br/>his/her former position.</p>
<p>16.5.2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on catastrophic leave for his/her own serious health<br/>condition is required to provide a fitness-for-duty certificate from<br/>his/her physician before he/she will be reinstated.</p>
