<p>5. These provisions will not alter the step and column placement or future<br/>advancement on the salary schedule of any employee employed at the<br/>time of ratification of this Agreement.</p>
<p>F. For purposes of placement and advancement on the salary schedule, an</p>
<p>employee must have completed seventy-five percent of the employee work days<br/>in order to be credited for one year of service credit.</p>
<p>Step advancement for a part-time employee will occur when the employee achieves<br/>100% of a full-time employee cumulatively over a period of years during their<br/>employment, unless otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
<p>1. An advisory committee, consisting of the Superintendent and/or the Principal, and<br/>one (1) or two (2) members of the EAPV may meet in May each year to consult with<br/>each other regarding proposed adjunct duties and extra pay stipends and related<br/>staffing issues for the following school year. If the parties agree that the involvement of<br/>a member of the Governing Board would be helpful, a Board member shall be<br/>designated by the administration to participate. If the committee reaches an agreement<br/>regarding proposed duties and extra pay staffing, it shall forward the proposed duties<br/>and extra pay staffing assignments to the Board for approval. Upon approval, the duties<br/>and extra pay staffing assignments shall be listed in Appendix C. If the committee is<br/>unable to reach an agreement regarding proposed duties and extra pay staffing, a Board<br/>member shall join the committee in an effort to facilitate a resolution. If the committee<br/>is unable to reach an agreement after a Board member joins the committee, die matter<br/>shall be submitted to a mediator from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service to<br/>facilitate a resolution. If a resolution is not reached through a mediator, the Board shall<br/>determine the duties and extra pay staffing for the following school year and shall list<br/>those duties and extra pay staffing assignments in Appendix C. Nothing in this<br/>agreement prohibits a teacher fram voluntarily performing additional duties upon notice<br/>to the Superintendent and Board.</p>
<p>2. Compensation for each duty will be determined by the advisory committee and</p>
<p>conveyed to the School Board President. The total amount allocated for adjunct duties<br/>will be increased annually by a percentage designated by the Committee. Adjunct duties<br/>and extra pay stipends are noted in Appendix C.</p>

<p>8 of 40</p>
<p>amount provided by the State minus the fixed costs and administrative costs. In<br/>other words, staff development will not encroach on the general funds of the<br/>District. Attendance by individual employees is voluntary.</p>
<p>K. Employees are eligible, at their own expense, to participate in a 403(b) or 457 Plan</p>
<p>selected by the District. The District shall not be obligated to provide any 403(b) or 457<br/>Plan to employees if the District incurs any fees or expenses related to a 403(b) or 457<br/>Plan. The District shall not be obligated to make any contributions to a 403(b) or 457<br/>Plan for the benefit of its employees.

<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>HOURS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional responsibilities of unit employees include teaching; lesson<br/>planning and preparation; grading and record keeping; meeting with students,<br/>parents, and District personnel; improvement of teaching skills, and participating<br/>in adjunct duties incident to the District's programs. The professional nature of<br/>these responsibilities does not lend itself to a workday of rigidly established<br/>length,</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal workday for teachers will begin at 8 a.m. and end at 3:15 p.m. Current full-<br/>time teachers will not have their work hours adjusted without their written agreement<br/>unless provided otherwise in this Agreement. Part-time, temporary teachers or full-time<br/>teachers hired after July 1, 2009 may be assigned work hours as early as 7 a.m. or as<br/>late as 4:15 p.m. but the workday will not exceed 7 hours and 15 minutes per workday<br/>and will not require more than 315 student instruction minutes per workday. Employees<br/>shall have an 18 minute break from 10:00 a.m. to 10:18 a.m. Class instruction shall<br/>resume at 10:18 a.m. Based upon the needs of the District, the Superintendent shall be<br/>allowed to change the starting time of this break, however, the Superintendent shall<br/>provide one day's notice of any change, except in case of an emergency, where notice<br/>shall not be required. Unless otherwise agreed, the lunch period will run from 12:00 to<br/>12:45 on a regular day and from 12:30 to 1:15 on a minimum day. On a regular day,<br/>the warning bell shall ring at 12:40 and the teachers shall open their doors for class at<br/>12:45.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year for full-time teachers will be 185 days, 181 days of which will be pupil<br/>contact instructional days. The four additional days shall be utilized primarily for the<br/>purpose of preparation. However, the days are work days for which the employee is paid<br/>and as such, the District retains the right to direct the employees and to assign tasks as<br/>necessary during those days. The administration may hold up to seven hours of<br/>meetings on the two workdays immediately prior to the first student attendance day.</p>
<p>The Association will be consulted annually on the school calendar prior to its adoption by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-curricular assignments are considered to be mandatory requirements of the job. As is<br/>the case with adjunct duties, teachers are expected to remain beyond the minimum on¬<br/>site hours, as necessary, to perform the duties.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers will be sought first. If there are insufficient volunteers, the site<br/>administrator will assign teachers to perform the duties. The assignments<br/>will be made in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of co-curricular assignments will be substantially similar to<br/>the amount given in prior years.</p>

<p>nez.DowilMds EAPV 2013-2015 (00207045j.doc j</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance at faculty meetings is mandatory. Part-time and full-time employees will<br/>attend faculty meetings and staff development. Meetings will be called on an &quot;as<br/>needed&quot; basis.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will only be required to return for evening duty on &quot;Back-to-School&quot; Night,<br/>&quot;Open House&quot; night and Winter (Christmas) Program.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers will not be responsible for lunchtime and/or recess duty except as<br/>needed to occasionally substitute for an absent noon or recess duty aide. This<br/>duty will be rotated and assigned equitably.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers agree to utilize up to 10 furlough days for any fiscal year only if the financial<br/>shortfall necessitates. Necessity to utilize up to 10 furlough days will be determined by<br/>the Superintendent and EAVP President. A decision to use furlough days will be finalized<br/>by the end of February. Furloughs: The following process shall be utilized to institute<br/>potential furlough days for school year during the term of the contract. If the<br/>unrestricted ending fund balance reflected in the second interim report for a school year<br/>(January) is less than the unrestricted ending fund balance reflected in the second<br/>interim report for the previous school year, then the District, after consulting with EAPV,<br/>shall institute employee furloughs in order to increase the unrestricted fund balance to a<br/>level it deems fiscally prudent. The number of furlough days to be implemented shall<br/>not exceed ten (10) days for any school year. The Superintendent shall inform the EAPV<br/>representative of the necessity for furloughs no later than five days after determining<br/>that furlough days are necessary. If instituted, furlough days shall be divided equally<br/>throughout the remaining months of the spring semester for that school year. The<br/>Superintendent shall schedule furlough days in a manner that causes the least amount<br/>of disruption to student learning. Employee salaries shall be reduced commensurate<br/>with the number of furlough days implemented.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever an employee is absent from duty on account of his/her own<br/>illness or injury for a period of time in excess of the current year's sick<br/>leave to which he/she is entitled, he/she will be allowed full compensation<br/>for the period, if any, of his/her accumulated sick leave earned, but<br/>unused in previous years of service with the District, and/or the lesser of<br/>the following amounts for a period of not to exceed five school months<br/>during the current school year; said period being exclusive of the number<br/>of days of accumulated sick leave paid at full salary.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 10<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is an alleged violation of the specific term of this Agreement. A<br/>grievance may be filed by an employee, employees or the Association. Actions<br/>to challenge or change the policies of the District as set forth in the rules and<br/>regulations or administrative regulations and procedures, so long as these are<br/>consistent with the terms of the Agreement, must be undertaken under separate<br/>legal processes. Other matters for which a specific method of review is provided<br/>by law are not within the scope of this procedure. Neither the content of an<br/>employee's Performance Evaluation nor the employment status of probationary<br/>employees will be subject to the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is a day in which school is open. In the event a grievance is being<br/>processed after the close of the school year, at the option of a grievant, the<br/>grievance will be suspended until the commencement of the new semester.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level. Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant will attempt<br/>to resolve it by an informal discussion with the grievant's immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level.</p>
<p>Level I: Within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving<br/>rise to the grievance, the grievant must present the grievance in writing on the<br/>appropriate District designated form to the Superintendent. This will be a clear,<br/>concise statement of the grievance, the circumstances involved, the specific<br/>proviston(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been violated, and the specific<br/>remedy sought. The Superintendent will communicate a decision to the<br/>employee in writing within 20 days after receiving the grievance. If the<br/>superintendent does not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal<br/>to the next level. Within the above time limits, either party may request a<br/>personal conference with the other party.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II: If the grievant is not satisfied with the Superintendent's decision, the<br/>grievant may, within 15 days (or within 15 days of the date the Superintendent's<br/>decision should have been issued, if no decision was issued), appeal the matter<br/>to Grievance Conciliation with the agreement of the Association.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant will submit a signed statement setting forth in a clear,<br/>concise manner the reasons for the appeal and whether a hearing is<br/>requested. The statement will also include a copy of the original<br/>grievance as well as all other subsequent written documentation regarding<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will then schedule a meeting with a conciliator from the<br/>California State Mediation and Conciliation Service as soon as reasonably<br/>possible for all parties of interest.</p>

<p>Macintosh HD:Useis:iyangomez:Downloads:EAPV 2013-2015 (00207045) doc x</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III. If the grievant is not satisfied with the results of Conciliation, the<br/>grievant may request that the Association submit the grievance to<br/>mediation/arbitration or the grievant may waive the right to mediation/<br/>arbitration and appeal directly to the Board of Education.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association concurs with a request for Arbitration, the parties will<br/>submit the matter to the State mediator who will conduct a hearing and<br/>make a binding decision on the submitted issue.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State mediator will determine arbitrability (if an issue), hear evidence,<br/>and render a decision as governed by the rules and practices of the<br/>American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the State mediator will be final and binding except that the<br/>State mediator will have no power to add to, to subtract from, or to modify<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant chooses to appeal to the Board of Education, the grievant will<br/>submit a signed statement setting forth in a clear, concise manner the reasons<br/>for the appeal and whether a hearing is requested. The statement will also<br/>include a copy of the original grievance as well as all other subsequent written<br/>documentation regarding the grievance. After reviewing the matter, the Board of<br/>Education will issue its decision, in writing, to the grievant within 45 days of the<br/>hearing, or if no hearing is requested, within 45 days of receipt of the appeal.</p>
<p>The decision of the Board will be final and binding.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member alleging a grievance may be represented at any or all<br/>stages of the grievance procedure by an Association Representative.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall take no reprisals against any employee for the<br/>exercise of his/her rights under this Article.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may at any time present grievances to the District and<br/>have such grievances processed and/or adjusted, without<br/>representation by the Association as long as the adjustment is not<br/>contrary to terms of this written Agreement. If an employee pursues<br/>a grievance without the intervention of the Association beyond Level<br/>I, the grievance shall not be considered resolved until the<br/>Association has received notice of the grievance and the proposed<br/>solution.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All time limits hereinafter set forth shall begin the day following the<br/>event that causes movement to the next step or level of the<br/>procedure. Because it is important that grievances be processed as<br/>rapidly as possible, the time limits specified at each level should be<br/>considered to be maximums and every effort must be made to</p>

<p>expedite the process. Time limits may be extended only by mutual<br/>agreement between the grievant and the District Administrator.</p>
<p>5. The failure by the District to meet any deadline set forth in this<br/>Article shall give the grievant the right to proceed to the next<br/>grievance processing level. Failure by a grievant to meet any<br/>deadline set forth in this Article shall terminate the grievance at that<br/>level and the grievant shall have no right to proceed further upon the<br/>grievance or to re-file on the same set of facts.</p>
