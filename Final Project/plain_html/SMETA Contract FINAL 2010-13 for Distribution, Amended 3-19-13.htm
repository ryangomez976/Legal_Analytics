<p>3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level III (Board of Trustees)</p>
<p>If the Grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at Formal Level II, or if no<br/>written decision has been rendered within fifteen (15) days after the Grievant's conference, if any, with the<br/>Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, the Grievant may, within fifteen (15) days<br/>after a decision by the Superintendent or the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, or within fifteen<br/>(15) days after the decision should have been given, request in writing to the Superintendent and the<br/>Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources that the grievance be submitted to Formal Level III (Board).<br/>The request shall be accompanied by copies of all previous grievance statements, the decisions rendered at<br/>each level, the names of the Conferees, if any, and a clear and concise statement of reasons for requesting<br/>the appeal at Level III.</p>

<p>3.3.5.1 Within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Facilitation Process written resolution<br/>from the Superintendent or if the Superintendent does not respond within ten (10) days after the completion<br/>of the Facilitation Process, the Association shall notify the District of its intent to arbitrate the grievance.</p>
<p>It is understood that appeal at this level is a request for a hearing before an Arbitrator. The request<br/>shall be accompanied by copies of all previous grievance statements, the decisions rendered at each level,<br/>the names of the Conferees, if any, and a clear concise statement of the reasons for requesting a hearing.</p>
<p>The Association and the District shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement can be<br/>reached, they shall request the State Mediation/Conciliation Service to supply a panel of five (5) names of<br/>persons experienced in hearing grievances in public schools. Each party beginning with the<br/>Grievant/Grievant’s Representative/s shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The<br/>remaining panel member shall be the arbitrator. The District will pay the cost of the substitute(s) for the<br/>Grievant(s) if one is needed.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall as soon as possible hear evidence within thirty (30) days of his/her appointment<br/>and render a decision on the issue or issues submitted to him/her within thirty (30) days of the completion of<br/>hearing evidence. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding on the parties. If the parties cannot agree<br/>upon a submission agreement, the parties will have 20 days to make their written submissions to the<br/>arbitrator. The arbitrator shall consider the submissions and determine the issues by referring to the written</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>grievance and the answers thereto at each step. The arbitrator will have no authority to: (1) add to, subtract<br/>from or modify the terms of this Agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations and procedures of the<br/>District, (2) award interest to any monetary remedy, (3) award punitive damages unless there is a finding that<br/>the violation was willful, flagrant, knowing and repeated, (4) award back-pay remedies which go beyond<br/>eighteen (18) months prior to the date of filing of the grievance at Level I.</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem expenses, travel and<br/>subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing room will be borne by the District and/or the<br/>Grievant/Grievant’s Representative/s as follows: There will be a 50/50 cost split unless the arbitrator finds that the<br/>grievance or defense is specious or without merit, and in such cases the arbitrator can apportion some or all of his/her<br/>fees and costs to one or both of the parties on some other basis as he/she thinks fit. All other costs will be borne by<br/>the party incurring them.</p>
<p>3.4 Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days indicated at each level should be considered a maximum and every<br/>effort should be made to expedite the process.</p>
<p>3.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time allowances set forth in this procedure may be extended by written mutual consent of the<br/>Grievant and the District.</p>
<p>3.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances will be prepared by the District.</p>
<p>3.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals shall be taken by or against any participant in the grievance procedure by reason<br/>of such participation.</p>
<p>3.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in<br/>this grievance procedure by the end of the school year, it is understood that the process will continue into the<br/>summer months so as to resolve all grievances prior to the opening of the next school year.</p>
<p>3.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the administration at a<br/>level above the principal or immediate supervisor, the Grievant may commence such grievance at Formal<br/>Level II (Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources).</p>
<p>3.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at Levels I, II and III of the grievance procedure will be in writing setting<br/>forth the decision and reasons therefore and will be transmitted promptly to all parties in interest and to the<br/>President of the Association.</p>

Any unit member who is requested to appear in such hearings, as a witness, will be<br/>accorded the same right. The District shall make space available when setting the time of the hearing.</p>
<p>3.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance will be<br/>filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the participants.</p>

Also, should the Board fail to adopt the employee complaint policy and procedures, the<br/>Association shall have the right to re-open negotiations on Article 4, Employee Rights.) One copy of<br/>current Board policies will be kept at each site and accessible to all unit members upon request.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 4</p>
<p>EMPLOYEE RIGHTS</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the right of unit members to form, join and participate in lawful<br/>activities of employee organizations and the equal alternative right of unit members to refuse to form, join or<br/>participate in employee organizational activities. The Association will not interfere with the right of employees<br/>to refrain from listening to or speaking with an Association representative.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the right of unit members to representation on all matters of<br/>employer-employee relations.</p>
<p>4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member may at any time present grievances to the District and have such grievances<br/>adjusted without the intervention of the Association, as long as the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration<br/>and the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. The District shall not agree to a<br/>resolution of a formal level grievance until the exclusive representative has received a copy of the grievance<br/>and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to respond within the time limits in Article 3.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Association and the Board of Trustees or designee(s) may meet and negotiate on matters<br/>within the scope of representation.</p>
<p>4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any contract between the District and any unit member shall be subject to and consistent with<br/>the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be required to function in a management or supervisory capacity (as defined in<br/>Government Code §3540.1). Such assignments shall be made only upon mutual agreement between the<br/>District and the unit member for emergencies of a short-term nature.</p>
<p>4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student teachers or interns shall not be assigned to unit members without the member's prior<br/>agreement. Once such an assignment has commenced it shall continue to its pre-established concluding<br/>date (usually end of year or end of semester) unless there is District approved reason for interrupting the<br/>assignment. Compensation that a master teacher receives for working with a student teacher will be sent to<br/>the master teacher by the district at the conclusion of the student teaching period following the completion of<br/>the appropriate paperwork. Prior to the end of the school year, bargaining unit members may indicate in<br/>writing to their site principal an interest in working with a student teacher the following school year. Such<br/>requests shall be considered.</p>
<p>4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member will be invited to participate with the principal in the initial employment</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>recommendation for a candidate to be a paid aide in that unit member's classroom. Unit members will be<br/>consulted by the site administrator prior to the assignment of a currently employed or a new paid aide to the<br/>unit member's classroom if there is more than one aide in a given classification assigned to the school.<br/>Subsequently, the unit member shall be regularly involved by the site administrator in the evaluation of that<br/>aide's performance. The site administrator is the prime evaluator of the aide. When, in the judgment of the<br/>unit member that aide's performance is less than satisfactory, or the placement appears to be inappropriate,<br/>the unit member shall inform both the aide, and the unit member's immediate supervisor. The supervisor<br/>shall develop an assistance plan with the help of the unit member to improve the aide's performance.

Appendix C-2 contains the 2007-2008 regular<br/>certificated salary schedule, which applies a one-percent (1%) salary increase effective mid-year (which is<br/>93 days of employment) for the 2007-2008 school year. In addition, specific cells on the salary schedule<br/>shall be adjusted for market equity (on July 1,2007 after the 2% salary increase has been applied) as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column I, step 1 of the regular certificated salary schedule shall be increased by $500.</p>

<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>after the 2% salary increase has been applied).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix E contains the 2012-2013 regular certificated salary schedule, which applies a 3.0% salary<br/>increase over the 2007-08 salary schedule retroactive to July 1,2012. Regular certificated employees in<br/>active service as of March 19, 2013 shall receive a 2% salary increase off the salary schedule in their<br/>June pay warrant or their last pay warrant for the 2012-2013 fiscal year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix F contains the 2013-2014 regular certificated salary schedule, which applies a 2.0% salary<br/>increase over the 2012-2013 effective July 1,2013.</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2000/2001 school year, all certificated employees will receive a 3.0% increase<br/>applied to the 1999/2000 salary schedule plus a 1.5% increase applied to the 1999/2000 salary schedule<br/>to implement the State funded Buy-Back Day Professional Development Program for a total of increase of<br/>4.5%. The teacher work year will be increased from 183 days to 186 days starting with the 2000/2001<br/>school year. The school psychologist work year will be increased from 203 to 206 days starting with the<br/>2000/2001 school year. The increase of three days will allow the school district to fully implement the<br/>State Buy-Back Day Program. This will provide all certificated staff with three days of professional<br/>development during this school year and every year thereafter that the Buy-Back Day Program is funded<br/>by the State of California. The Association will annually inform the Bargaining Unit of the importance of<br/>attending the Buy-Back Day Program.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2008-2009 school year, all certificated employees’ salaries will be adjusted as</p>
<p>follows:</p>
<p>The salary increase for the 2008-09 school year shall be based upon the percentage change in the<br/>funded base revenue limit per ADA. From the percentage so identified, the parties have agreed to<br/>subtract step and column, and health and welfare benefit increases at the rates shown below. For the<br/>purposes of this calculation the parties agree that 0.70% shall be subtracted for health and welfare<br/>increases regardless of actual costs in the 2008-2009 school year. The increased cost of step and<br/>column shall also be subtracted from the on-going change in funded base revenue limit per ADA. For the<br/>purposes of this calculation the parties agree that 1.0% shall be subtracted regardless of the actual cost<br/>of step and column for the 2008-2009 school year. Effective July 1,2009, the salary schedule shall be<br/>increased by the difference remaining after the adjustments have been made for health and welfare<br/>benefits and step and column.</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If the on-going change in base revenue limit per ADA is 4.3% the salary adjustment would be as follows:<br/>4.30%</p>
<p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.70%</p>
<p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.00%</p>
<p>2.60% = the increase to the 2008-2009 salary schedule.</p>
<p>5.1.3 Beginning 2001-02 school year, employees in Column I are not required to obtain 30 units<br/>beyond a BA degree to qualify for Step increases.</p>
<p>5.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members placed on the BA+30 or less column who have less than 30<br/>semester units past the BA degree shall remain at their current step placement until 30 or more semester<br/>units past the BA degree have been earned.</p>
<p>5.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the unit member has earned 30 or more units past the BA degree, the unit<br/>member shall be advanced the number of steps necessary to equal the number of years of experience as<br/>provided for elsewhere in this article.</p>
<p>5.2 Benefits</p>
<p>5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District fringe benefit contributions each month, for full time regular employees, will be<br/>increased to the cost of the lowest cost HMO plan, employee only coverage, through CalPERS and for<br/>dental coverage. Participation in the dental insurance plan shall be mandatory; otherwise, the amounts<br/>placed in each option shall be discretionary with the member of the unit. Existing insurance programs will<br/>be maintained unless there is mutual agreement to change. Part-time employees will receive benefits<br/>prorated to their service. The District will continue its present liability insurance coverage for unit<br/>members. All insurance coverage referred to in this article shall be subject to carrier qualifications and<br/>requirements. The District and the Association will select a Joint Committee to investigate alternatives to<br/>Delta Dental and present their findings to the bargaining teams by January 2005.</p>
<p>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Benefits</p>
<p>5.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to contribute the minimum employer contribution rate required<br/>by SB 1464 per eligible unit member working more than 50% time for an approved PERS health plan<br/>option. This amount shall be the District's basic employee-only medical benefits contribution.</p>
<p>5.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the District agrees to contribute a supplemental amount equal to the</p>
<p>15</p>

This supplemental amount will be paid retroactively<br/>to January 1,2007.

The District will first deduct the cost of the employee’s monthly dental insurance premium from<br/>the monthly cash-in-lieu amount of $250 and then provide the employee with the remaining amount.</p>
<p>5.2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any excess premium after application of 5.2.2.1 and 5.2.2.2 shall be the sole<br/>responsibility of the unit member who shall authorize salary deduction of such costs as a condition of<br/>receipt of such benefit in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code Section 125 requirements.</p>

<p>Step 12, Class IV, on the salary schedule. The daily salary for days less than a block of five days beyond<br/>186 days will be computed at a per diem rate. The per diem rate will be computed as follows: Annual<br/>salary on Step and Class placement on the salary schedule, plus 7% of salary or $1500, whichever is<br/>higher, plus advanced degree(s) credit, divided by 183 days for 1999-2000, and 186 days for the<br/>remainder of the contract.</p>

All other unit members will receive the IRS rate for actual miles driven. Under the<br/>rate-per-mile alternative plan, the employee shall be responsible for maintaining a log of miles to be<br/>claimed.

<p>5.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement Benefits</p>
<p>5.11.1 The District and the Association have agreed to enter into a program whereby qualifying<br/>retirees may exchange substitute teacher service for continued District medical insurance coverage only,<br/>as provided for herein. It is the intent of the District and the Association in entering into this program to<br/>provide an optional benefit for retiring employees in exchange for a strengthening of the existing<br/>substitute teacher service.</p>
<p>5.11.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for this option shall be limited to:</p>
<p>5.11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members retiring under STRS/PERS within the term of this collective<br/>bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>5.11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have worked in the District at least the previous continuous</p>
<p>five (5) years.</p>

<p>benefits.</p>
<p>5.11.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who properly complete the application procedure and</p>
<p>5.11.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who properly complete the substitute teacher commitment.</p>
<p>5.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical benefits available to a retiree opting for this plan shall be the same as the<br/>medical coverage available to active employees (article 5.2.3.1), subject to CalPERS conditions, plus a<br/>lump sum payment at the conclusion of the year of specified substitute service equal to two-hundred and<br/>fifty dollars ($250).</p>
<p>5.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of the substitute service to be annually rendered by the retiree shall be<br/>computed as follows:</p>
<p>5.11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the annual District contribution level for medical insurance coverage for<br/>active employees shall be subtracted the amount of the annual District contribution for medical insurance<br/>coverage that the retiree would have otherwise been entitled to.</p>
<p>5.11.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference shall be divided by the per diem substitute teacher rate of pay,<br/>rounded to the nearest whole dollar; the result shall be the number of days of annual substitute service to<br/>be rendered by the retiree under the terms and conditions of the agreement entered into by the retiree<br/>and the District.</p>
<p>5.11.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A retired employee who fails to render the number of substitute teaching days<br/>shall be required to reimburse the District, at the per diem substitute teacher rate of pay, for the days of<br/>unfulfilled substitute service. Failure to render the service for any other reason than personal illness or<br/>genuine emergency in the retiree’s immediate family, or failure to reimburse the District for unfulfilled<br/>substitute service shall automatically result in: cancellation of the retiree’s medical insurance coverage<br/>option effective thirty (30) days after the failure(s) occurred; and forfeiture of any portion of the annual<br/>lump sum payment described in Section 5.11.3.2, above.</p>
<p>5.11.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon submitting their letter of retirement the employee shall be provided with a<br/>copy of the program description. A current employee desiring to participate in this program shall notify the<br/>District in writing no later than August 15.</p>

<p>HOURS</p>
<p>6.1 Work Day Unit members other than psychologists shall be at their work site and responsible for<br/>instruction/job assignment and other assigned duties for seven and one-quarter (7-1/4) consecutive hours per<br/>day. Psychologists shall be available for their duties for eight (8) hours per day.</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be entitled to a daily lunch period within the defined working day.</p>
<p>At the middle school, the lunch period shall be 40 minutes or one period unless the site<br/>administrator, for good reason and after seeking the advice and counsel of the staff, elects to shorten it.</p>
<p>At the K-5 schools, a duty-free lunch period shall range from 50 to 60 minutes. The District agrees to<br/>give each K-5 school funds sufficient to provide a 60-minute duty-free lunch for bargaining unit members.<br/>Bargaining unit members at each site in consultation with the principal, may, by majority vote of bargaining<br/>unit members, decide to have less than a 60- minute lunch, but not less than 50 minutes, and use the extra<br/>lunch period funds provided by the District for school-related purposes.</p>
<p>During their lunch period, unit members shall not be regularly assigned to student supervision duties<br/>except as might be required due to inclement weather or unforeseen problems. Unit members who conduct<br/>parent conferences or are assigned to student supervision for any reason during the lunch period shall be<br/>free to leave the work site at normal student dismissal time or thirty (30) minutes prior to normal leaving time,<br/>whichever is later.</p>
<p>6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be required to perform instructional or other duties for unreasonable<br/>periods of time without a break for personal needs. Should recess duty or rainy day schedule prohibit this<br/>break, provisions for a break will be provided. The plan of coverage shall be developed at a staff meeting in<br/>consultation with certificated personnel assigned to the school. In the middle schools, the student passing<br/>time between periods will satisfy this requirement. In K-5 schools the sharing of student recess period<br/>supervision generally satisfies this requirement. The site administrator shall seek the advice and counsel of<br/>the site staff when scheduling recesses, with the intent of providing reasonable daily breaks for personal<br/>needs.</p>
<p>6.1.2.1 In the middle schools preparation time provision will be met by the practice of<br/>assigning teachers a teaching responsibility with one period less than the number of periods in the regular<br/>student day.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>All K-5 schools, after consultation with the staff, shall establish a minimum of one hundred</p>
<p>fifty (150) minutes per week during which teachers will not be assigned to direct instruction or supervision of<br/>students.</p>
<p>These provisions shall not limit site administrators from assigning unit members to<br/>supervision due to unanticipated problems during assigned planning time.</p>
<p>6.1.2.2 The regular instructional day for teachers shall meet the following standards:<br/>Teachers shall be responsible for daily instruction in grades 6-8 in a seven-period schedule<br/>for not less than 275 minutes, and for not less than 277 minutes in a six-period schedule.</p>
<p>Teachers shall be responsible for daily instruction in grades 4-5 for not less than 300</p>
<p>minutes.</p>
<p>minutes.</p>
<p>Teachers shall be responsible for daily instruction in grades 1-3 for not less than 280</p>
<p>Teachers in kindergarten shall have primary responsibility for a regular single-session of 200<br/>minutes, and may be assigned to assist in other classes, as allowed by law. In total, the kindergarten<br/>teachers shall not be required to provide more than 280 minutes of daily instruction.</p>
<p>Within the limits set forth in 6.1.2.2 the faculty and principal at each school shall mutually<br/>agree on the length of the instructional day for unit members. If there is no agreement between the faculty<br/>and the principal, the length of the teacher's instructional day shall be not more than the minimum times<br/>stated in 6.1.2.2 above.</p>
<p>In developing kindergarten staggered-day programs, daily instruction time for students must<br/>be 200 minutes as required by Education Code §46201.</p>
<p>6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On days when unit members are scheduled to work but the pupils are not scheduled to be<br/>present, the workday shall be the same as in 6.1.</p>
<p>On days of an emergency release of pupils or on minimum pupil days, the workday shall be the<br/>same as in 6.1. When night meetings are required of unit members, it shall be normal practice to release unit<br/>members when pupils are dismissed, or when pupils are dismissed on the following day, as decided by the<br/>site administrator, with input from the faculty, except when other normally assigned duties or unforeseen<br/>problems prevent it.</p>
<p>6.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the District to maintain the current practice of allowing principals to request</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>up to ten (10) minimum days for the purpose of scheduling school-wide parent-teacher conferences.<br/>Minimum days shall be two hundred thirty (230) minutes for grades 1-2, and two hundred forty (240) for<br/>grades 3-8.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Duties</p>
<p>In addition to the work day as defined in 6.1, and in addition to Back-To-School Night, Open House,<br/>parent conferences and faculty meetings of reasonable frequency and length, unit members shall be<br/>available to render reasonable services related to teaching or assignment duties. Such service shall not<br/>exceed three (3) activities per unit member each year; however, service in activities beyond this limit may be<br/>performed on a voluntary basis at the sole discretion of the bargaining unit member. Service in activities<br/>beyond this limit shall be filled by volunteers only. Such assignments shall be distributed equitably among<br/>the school staff and shall be reasonable in frequency, length, and prescheduling. For performing arts<br/>teachers, who have student performances outside their workday up to two performances will count towards<br/>one of the three activities indicated in the second sentence of this paragraph.</p>
<p>It is further understood that the District operating under the constraints of the law, desires to<br/>accomplish State and Federal mandates with a minimum of after-school assignments and will make every<br/>reasonable effort to do so.</p>
<p>6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such additional assignments shall not occur on days when unit members are not otherwise on<br/>duty, unless unit members voluntarily agree.</p>
<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that site administrators will make every reasonable effort to schedule evening<br/>meetings for not more than two (2) hours.</p>

A written faculty meeting agenda shall be provided to the site staff at least<br/>24 hours prior to the scheduled start of the meeting. The agenda shall indicate the approximate length of the<br/>meeting shall be intended to not last longer than one hour.</p>

The District will respond to job share applications no<br/>later than June 1.</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time employees who accept a job-sharing assignment under the terms of Section 6.4 may<br/>request to return to full-time assignment for a subsequent contract year provided they notify the Human<br/>Resources Department no later than February 15 of the year of the job-sharing assignment of their desire to<br/>return to full-time status.

<p>ASSIGNMENT. TRANSFER &amp; FILLING OF VACANCIES</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assignment is an intra-school placement which does not involve a change in basic job<br/>classification.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer means an action which results in the interschool movement of a unit member or in<br/>movement from one basic job classification to another (e.g., teacher to librarian).</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary transfer is one that is initiated by the unit member and is agreeable to both parties.</p>
<p>7.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary transfer is one that is initiated by the District, in the best interests of the District.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments</p>
<p>7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At initial employment and for subsequent assignments, unit members shall be assigned on the<br/>basis of need, the best interests of the school district, and in consideration of specific qualifications of the unit<br/>member. When need requires a combination class assignment, such assignments should be made<br/>equitably. No unit member shall be involuntarily assigned to a year-round school/site.</p>
<p>7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments within a school are the responsibility of the site administrator and request for<br/>change shall be made directly to said individual. It shall be standard practice for the Principal to discuss<br/>possible changes in assignment at that school at a general faculty meeting prior to the close of the school<br/>year preceding the change.</p>
<p>7.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments shall be made by June 1 or two weeks prior to the last working day of the school<br/>calendar, whichever is later. In the event a unit member does not receive assignment by June 1 or two<br/>weeks prior to the last working day of the school calendar, whichever is later, he/she may request the site<br/>administrator for released time up to four (4) days during the first forty-five (45) days of the beginning of the<br/>school year. Changes in assignment shall not be made arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>
<p>7.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are reassigned after the start of the school year shall be eligible to have up<br/>to four (4) days of release time from responsibility for direct supervision or instruction of students for the<br/>purpose of preparing for the new assignment. This release time shall occur during the first thirty (30) days of<br/>the new assignment. In lieu of this substitute-release time, unit members may elect to make this change<br/>during non-school hours and will be compensated at the hourly rate as provided for in Article 5.8.3 for up to<br/>thirty (30) hours.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>7.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are required to move to another classroom in the school may request the<br/>principal for one work day of released time during the first ten (10) days of the new assignment. District will<br/>notify a non-classroom teaching unit member at least ten (10) days in advance if his/her office is to be moved<br/>during the period when the unit member is not on duty. Non-classroom teaching unit members shall also<br/>receive the one work day of release time referred to in this section.</p>
<p>7.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after commencement of the work year, it is necessary to change the assignment of a unit<br/>member it shall be standard practice for the administrator to discuss the situation in a general faculty meeting.<br/>A final determination by the site administrator will subsequently be made as to which member is to be<br/>reassigned, taking volunteers into consideration.</p>
<p>7.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who move classrooms due to Modernization will receive both (1) $350; and (2)<br/>be allowed to leave the school campus after the end of the teaching day on two minimum days. This move<br/>allowance will be received for each one way move. Early release for the minimum days must be with prior<br/>principal approval or if the school does not have a minimum day, the teacher will be released for an<br/>equivalent number of hours as the teacher on a minimum day.</p>
<p>7.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School District shall make every effort to reassign a Teacher on Special Assignment<br/>(TSA) or a Consulting Teacher (CT) to the school and assignment that they left when they assumed their<br/>duties as a TSA or a CT.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority System</p>
<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seniority system, as defined by law, will be utilized in the event that reduction in staff<br/>becomes necessary. District-wide seniority lists shall be posted annually by March 1 of each year.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers</p>
<p>7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers may be initiated by either the unit member, the building site administrator, or District<br/>office department head, and may be initiated and implemented by District management. Transfers shall not<br/>be made arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>7.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be involuntarily transferred in more than two successive years. No unit<br/>member shall be involuntarily transferred into a year-round school/site.</p>
<p>7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will seek and consider volunteers before making an involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>7.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members to be involuntarily transferred due to shifts in student population shall have the</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>right to indicate preferences from a list of vacancies and the employer shall consider such requests on the<br/>basis of District-wide needs.</p>
<p>When, in the judgment of the District, staffing needs can be met equally well by two or more unit<br/>members who are subject to involuntary transfer due to shifts in student population, the member with greater<br/>seniority within the District shall have preferential choice of the assignments to be filled.</p>
<p>7.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of a unit member's involuntary transfer for reasons other than shifts in student<br/>enrollment, program changes, or unforeseen circumstances, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>7.5.4.1 The principal or immediate supervisor shall submit to the Assistant Superintendent for<br/>Human Resources, a written request for a unit member's involuntary transfer following a conference with that<br/>unit member who shall also receive a copy of the transfer request. This written request will state the reasons<br/>for transfer.</p>
<p>7.5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, in the judgment of the District, unresolved matters involving a bargaining unit<br/>member persist, it shall be the practice of the District to forewarn the bargaining unit member that an<br/>involuntary transfer may be necessary.</p>
<p>7.5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, written notice of an involuntary transfer, stating the reasons for the<br/>transfer, shall be given to the bargaining unit member no later than twenty (20) bargaining unit member work<br/>days prior to the effective date of the transfer.</p>
<p>7.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are transferred after the start of the school year shall be eligible to have up<br/>to four (4) days of time released from responsibility for direct supervision or instruction of students for the<br/>purpose of preparing for the new assignment. This release time shall occur during the first thirty (30) days of<br/>the new assignment. In lieu of this substitute release time, unit members may elect to make this change<br/>during non-school hours and will be compensated at the hourly rate as provided for in Article 5.8.3 for up to<br/>thirty (30) hours.</p>
<p>Transfers will be made June 1 or two weeks prior to the last working day of the school calendar,<br/>whichever is later. In the event a unit member receives a transfer after June 1 or after two weeks prior to the<br/>last working day of the school calendar, he/she may request from the site administrator up to four (4) days of<br/>release time for preparation. This release time shall occur during the first forty-five (45) days of the new<br/>assignment. In lieu of this substitute release time, unit members may elect to make this change during non¬<br/>school hours and will be compensated at the hourly rate as provided for in Article 5.8.3 for up to thirty (30) hours.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>7.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who must be involuntarily transferred due to shifts in student population shall<br/>have preference for vacancies prior to considering voluntary transfer requests and/or other involuntary<br/>transfer requests. A vacancy is a position not currently held by a probationary or permanent employee. The<br/>exercise of this right of preference shall not require the transfer of unit members after school is in session, nor<br/>the transfer of a unit member to a position for which, in the judgment of the District, he/she is not well-<br/>qualified, nor shall such right of preference require the District to take action contrary to affirmative action<br/>mandates. The District has no obligation to notify unit members, except as provided in the contract, for the<br/>posting of vacancies.</p>
<p>7.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after commencement of the work year, it is necessary to transfer staff, it shall be standard<br/>practice for the administrator to discuss the situation in a general faculty meeting. A final determination by<br/>the District will subsequently be made as to which member is to be transferred, taking volunteers into<br/>consideration.</p>
<p>7.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an involuntary transfer during the school year of an employee to a position of<br/>lesser salary, such as counselor, or specialist (under §5.8.4) to teacher, the employee shall receive for the<br/>year the same salary as made for the original assignment.</p>

<p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paragraph.) No single classroom shall have more than two (2) full-inclusion students assigned, subject to the</p>
<p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements of full-inclusion students' lEPs. Each year, the placement of full-inclusion students into regular</p>
<p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classes shall be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistent with full-inclusion students' lEPs, and equitably rotated among the regular</p>
<p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;education staff.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 8</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>8.1 The Association and District acknowledge the passage of Measure B (parcel tax) in June, 1991,<br/>which provides funds, in part, to reduce class size. Therefore, the District shall staff schools utilizing the<br/>following ratios derived from Measure B:</p>
<p>K-2 classes 25:1<br/>3-8 classes 27:1</p>
<p>For grade 2/3 combination (split grade level) classes, the ratio which applies to grade 2 shall apply.</p>
<p>These ratios are understood to be the District ratios between the total number of pupils enrolled and<br/>the total number of teachers with regular classroom teaching responsibilities except that personnel funded by<br/>the Resource Specialist Program (RSP) shall be included in these ratios to a level equivalent to seven (7)<br/>students for each full-time RSP teacher at each site. For the 1991-92 school year only, at K-5 schools, the<br/>maximum effect shall be seven (7) students, even if there is more than one full-time RSP at the site. Should<br/>a school site council and faculty decide to restructure the school program in such a way as to involve the<br/>RSP teacher in regular education instruction, the RSP teacher at that school shall be given the opportunity to<br/>transfer to another school that has no such restructuring. If no such transfer is available or possible, the RSP<br/>teacher shall remain at that school, and shall not be required to provide instruction to regular education<br/>students.</p>
<p>These ratios shall be maintained subject to the following provisions:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools with at least twenty-seven (27) excess pupils will receive one additional teacher at<br/>any time of the school year up to March 1, if classroom facilities are available. If no<br/>classroom facilities are available other relief measures will be provided;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no school is impacted as in (a) above, the District is relieved from new hiring as long as the<br/>District-wide ratio is not exceeded by fifty-one (51) pupils.</p>
<p>These ratios would be altered only by mutual agreement in the event Measure B funds become<br/>inadequate, or the termination of Measure B funding.</p>
<p>8.1.1 The middle school student contact average will be 175 calculated as an individual school site<br/>average (excluding the Special Day Class teachers, Resource Specialist, and Physical Education Teachers<br/>at the site) with 185 as the individual teacher maximum student contacts.</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>8.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum daily student contact for a full time unit member with six (6) separate<br/>teaching periods shall be 185 except for Physical Education, which shall be 240.</p>
<p>8.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily student contact maximum for part time unit members shall be a prorated</p>
<p>amount.</p>
<p>8.1.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the specific written consent of the unit member for each additional student, the<br/>185 maximum may be exceeded.</p>
<p>8.1.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of this section shall be subject to the condition stated in contract<br/>section 8.1, last paragraph.</p>
<p>8.1.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students in core classes will be counted in each period of the core class (for<br/>example, a student in a two period core class will be counted twice.) Further, a student assigned to<br/>a teacher as a student classroom aide or as a peer helper will be counted as a teacher contact.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education classes and programs</p>
<p>8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education classes and programs are to be staffed in accordance with State law and<br/>the following recommended program standards: (1) Special Day Classes (SDC) - 12 students K-5 (15 at<br/>middle school); (2) Resource Specialist Programs (RSP - caseload - 28; and (3) Designated Instruction<br/>Services (DIS) - caseload - 55. Such staffing shall not be counted in the above ratios (8.1). In the event that<br/>a designated instructional service (DIS) unit member is assigned an individual caseload in excess of 56<br/>students, the unit member shall be provided relief in the same manner as described in Section 8.4.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education teachers will provide instruction and services as provided by law. Special<br/>Education teachers will also be available for consultation and other assistance to support classroom<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education teachers will be provided with up to 4 release days per year to complete<br/>legally required student documents. Release days must be scheduled in accordance with the Substitute<br/>Reservation System on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. The teacher must remain on District property<br/>during the release day. This program will be evaluated annually.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District staffing ratio shall not limit individual schools from implementing special staffing<br/>arrangements, such as: low-enrollment classes, differentiated staffing, large-group instruction or team<br/>teaching. Nor shall it limit individual schools from hiring specialists from their allotted number of teachers as<br/>long as other class-size requirements in this article are not violated.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>In developing special staffing arrangements, the site administrator is expected to seek the advice<br/>and counsel of that faculty and approval of the appropriate District central office administrators). A faculty<br/>will, upon request, receive a Superintendent's review of any special staffing arrangement that it opposes.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the District's pupil-teacher staffing ratio, it is the intent of the District to maintain K-2 classes at<br/>no more than 28 pupils, and 3-5 classes at no more than 30 pupils.</p>
<p>Whenever it appears necessary to schedule a class(es) which extends above these numbers, the<br/>site administrator shall ask for a review to obtain approval from the appropriate District level administrator.</p>
<p>In the event the temporary assignment of a student causes a class to exceed the numbers above,<br/>a review of the situation is to be held within three (3) school days between the site administrator and the<br/>appropriate District level administrator and appropriate action taken to relieve the situation. If the<br/>numbers exceed those above, the unit member will complete a Staffing Ratio Option Request Form<br/>(Appendix G) to determine type of additional support. The unit member/Association, upon request, will be<br/>involved in any review on a consulting basis.</p>
<p>The District's class-size goal is to have no more than thirty (30) students in a class, except for middle<br/>school classes where traditionally there is some large-group instruction.</p>
<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Middle School student to counselor ratio, for middle school on a district wide basis, will be<br/>maintained at 600:1. In the case of a fractional amount, the District will not need to employ another<br/>counselor until the next whole number is reached. This means, for example, that if application of the ratio<br/>yielded an FTE number between 5.01 and 5.99, the District would comply with the ratio of 5.0 Counselors.<br/>Reductions of currently employed counselors to achieve this ratio will occur through attrition only.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the practice of the District to staff the schools on the following:</p>
<p>8.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-half (0.5) librarian/certificated person for each middle school library/media center. The<br/>effect of this allocation shall be that a full-time unit member assigned as a middle school librarian, in a seven</p>
<p>(7) period day, shall serve as librarian for three (3) periods, be assigned to teach three (3) classes and have<br/>one (1) preparation period.</p>
<p>8.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) nurses for the District.</p>
<p>8.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) psychologist for each fifteen hundred (1500) pupils.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school site staff shall meet before June 1 to come to consensus about the grade level and/or<br/>course configuration of classes for the following school year.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>At the staff meeting scheduled on the day prior to the beginning of instruction, necessary changes,</p>
<p>2 which occurred during the summer months, shall be reviewed with the staff.</p>

<p>9.1.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days- Evaluatee's working days.</p>
<p>9.1.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluatee - Any unit member.</p>
<p>9.1.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator- These persons, designated by the Board, have the responsibility and<br/>authority to make judgments concerning the quality of performance of employees under their supervision.<br/>The primary evaluator of school site unit members is the Principal or Assistant Principal; all evaluations are<br/>reviewed and signed by the Principal. The primary evaluator of unit members assigned to the Central Office<br/>is the immediate certificated supervisor. If other management personnel are to be involved in the evaluation<br/>process, for the purpose of input, the unit member shall receive adequate prior notification. Only certificated<br/>management personnel may have evaluator status.</p>
<p>9.1.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Observation - Pre-scheduled classroom observation for the purpose of<br/>structured communication with the unit member, including completion of the &quot;Observation of Classroom<br/>Teaching&quot; form. In the event that two formal observations are required for an evaluation, a reasonable<br/>amount of time shall separate the two formal observations to allow the employee enough time to show</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>improvement and both shall be completed prior to the timelines indicated in section 9.2.8 of this<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>9.1.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Observation - Brief unscheduled visits by administrator(s) for the<br/>purpose of ongoing communication with unit members.</p>

A copy of the statement is to be kept by the evaluator, and one copy placed<br/>in the unit member's personnel file. The unit member being evaluated is to sign the statement. This<br/>signature does not indicate approval of the content, but rather that the statement has been read.</p>
<p>9.1.2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Evaluation A written summary statement on appropriate District forms, based<br/>upon formal observation and other pertinent information will be shared in a timely way with the unit member<br/>being evaluated.</p>
<p>9.1.2.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory Evaluation A permanent classroom teacher receives three (3) or<br/>more ratings of one (1) on their final evaluation.(See Article 12.1.8) This evaluation shall be based on no less<br/>than two formal observations. Permanent employees who are not classroom teachers will be evaluated as<br/>indicated in section 9.2.5 of this agreement.</p>
<p>9.1.2.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubric The scale by which an employee is measured.</p>
<p>9.2 General Procedures</p>
<p>9.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process is designed to assist the unit member in improving his/her<br/>performance and to acknowledge individual strengths. This can best be achieved in a supportive,<br/>cooperative atmosphere. Ongoing informal classroom visits by the site administrator/primary evaluator<br/>throughout the year will foster this atmosphere, and will complement formal classroom observations. The<br/>expectation is that administrators will devote as much time as needed to support unit members in their<br/>professional development.</p>
<p>9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All temporary and probationary classroom teachers will be evaluated pursuant to legal<br/>requirements, using the process described in Section 9.3.</p>

<p>9.3 Evaluation of Probationarv/Temporarv Unit Members</p>
<p>Non-permanent unit members shall be evaluated each year, as required by law in order to determine<br/>whether or not the individual is meeting district standards. The number of observations shall be determined<br/>by the evaluator to gather sufficient data to make appropriate recommendations and provide a proper<br/>evaluation. The primary focus in the evaluation of first year Temporary/first year Probationary unit<br/>members shall be on coaching, support and feedback related to the Standards.</p>
<p>9.3.1 First year Temporary/first year probationary unit members will focus on two District<br/>specified standards, looking at key elements under each standard to identify specific areas. In addition,<br/>feedback may be provided on all six Standards. By October 15th the first year temporary/first year<br/>probationary unit member will meet with their evaluator to discuss the evaluation process and the<br/>following two standards: 1. Create and Maintain Effective Environments for Student Learning; 2. Plan<br/>Instruction and Design Learning Experiences for All Students.</p>
<p>9.3.1.1 There will be a minimum of two formal observations throughout the year. The<br/>following format for formal observations will be followed:</p>
<p>9.3.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-observation Conference</p>
<p>9.3.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Discussion: Except for unforeseen circumstances, no<br/>later than three working days after observation.</p>
<p>9.3.1.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of observation: Minimum of twenty continuous minutes.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>9.3.1.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Written Summary: No later than ten working days<br/>after observation. Meeting to discuss this written observation is not required.</p>
<p>9.3.1.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Formal Observations: No more than one in any five day</p>
<p>working period.</p>
<p>9.3.1.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of Formal Observations: Probationary/Temporary Unit<br/>Members: Minimum of two, maximum of three (more by mutual agreement).</p>
<p>9.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation feedback will be centered around but not limited to identified<br/>standards of focus so that feedback is meaningful. The site administrator/primary evaluator will offer<br/>support, methods and/or ideas as needed.</p>
<p>9.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal classroom visits by the administrator throughout the year will foster<br/>dialogue and support.</p>
<p>9.3.2 Continuing Temporary / Probationary unit members will focus on positive progress toward three<br/>new standards, looking at key elements under each standard to identify specific areas. The three<br/>new standards are 1. Engaging and Supporting All Students in Learning 2. Assessing Students for<br/>Learning and 3. Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning. The unit<br/>member will continue to work on standards of focus from the first year.</p>
<p>9.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 15th the continuing Temporary/Probationary unit member will meet to<br/>review the standards of focus for the evaluation year.</p>
<p>9.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A temporary unit member with more than three years of service with the district<br/>and who has met the standards, shall be evaluated using the same procedures as permanent unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>9.3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a minimum of two formal observations throughout the year. The<br/>format will be the same as Section 9.3.1.1 above.</p>
<p>9.4 Evaluation of Permanent Unit Members</p>
<p>All permanent unit members shall be observed and evaluated in their teaching/job performance no<br/>less than every other year. The number and frequency of observations shall be determined by the evaluator<br/>with input from the unit member so as to gather sufficient data to make appropriate recommendations and to<br/>provide a proper evaluation. In the event that the evaluator determines that the employee may receive an<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation the evaluator will inform the unit member in writing of the potential unsatisfactory</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>evaluation and do another formal evaluation. All formal observations must be completed prior to the date<br/>indicated in section 9.2.8, Timelines, of this agreement. At the request of the unit member, additional<br/>observations will occur.</p>
<p>9.4.1 The primary focus in the evaluation of Permanent unit members shall be on coaching,<br/>support, professional development and feedback related to the six standards.</p>
<p>9.4.2 Permanent unit members who have completed at least three years of teaching experience in the<br/>district and have met the standards during the prior evaluation period may choose to be evaluated using<br/>either Option I or Option II. Option II requires the approval of the site administrator/primary evaluator<br/>when an evaluatee receives a “(2) partially meets standards” and “(1) doesn't meet standards&quot; during the<br/>prior evaluation period.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1 Option I - By October 30th the Permanent unit member will meet with the site<br/>administrator/primary evaluator to set goals and to establish an evaluation plan. The Permanent unit<br/>member will identify one or two standards. Looking at key elements under each standard will identify<br/>specific areas of focus. One standard or key element(s) may be added at the discretion of the site<br/>administrator/primary evaluator in consultation with the unit member. The Permanent unit member may<br/>then choose only to focus on the administrator's selected standard or key element(s). The overall<br/>evaluation will address all six standards and the unit member will focus on one or two standards. The<br/>following format will be used for formal observations.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-observation Conference: Optional for permanent unit members.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of observation: Minimum of twenty continuous minutes.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Discussion: Except for unforeseen circumstances,<br/>no later than three working days after observation.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-observation Written Summary: No later than ten working days<br/>after observation. Meeting to discuss this written observation is not required.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Formal Observations: No more than one in any five<br/>day working period. This limit upon the number and frequency of observations shall not apply when the<br/>unit member receives a 45-day or 90-day notice under Education Code §44938.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.5.1 Number of Formal Observations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Unit</p>
<p>Members: Minimum of one, maximum of three for Option I (more by mutual agreement). For Option II,</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>the number required, if any is determined by the evaluation plan selected. For referred teachers to PAR<br/>program, the unit member, will receive, if they request it, more than one (1) formal observation. This request<br/>must be made in writing and be provided to the evaluator by October 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation feedback will be centered on but not limited to identified<br/>standards of focus so the feedback is meaningful. The site administrator/primary evaluator will offer<br/>support, methods and/or ideas as needed.</p>
<p>9.4.2.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator will offer continued support and coaching through<br/>dialogue and informal classroom visits throughout the year.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2 Option II is available to all Permanent unit members who have completed at<br/>least three years of teaching experience in the district and have met the standards during the prior<br/>evaluation period.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.1 Option II may be available to evaluatees who “(2) partially meet” or<br/>“(1) doesn’t meet” the standards based on the prior evaluation with the approval of the site<br/>administrator/primary evaluator.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once Option II has been approved, evaluatees shall select the plan</p>
<p>(see Section 9.4.2.2.4, list of Option II Plans) for Option II.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Option II format will consist of the following:</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 30th the unit member and the site</p>
<p>administrator/primary evaluator shall meet to set goals and establish an evaluation plan, based on the<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession. The timeline may encompass one year or two years by<br/>mutual agreement of the unit member and the site administrator/primary evaluator. If the evaluation<br/>encompasses two successive years and standards are met, then the unit member will have a one-year<br/>interim prior to the next evaluation.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.3.2 Prior to the Permanent unit member's evaluation deadline,<br/>the unit member shall complete a Self-Evaluation Report describing the progress toward meeting<br/>established goals. Progress toward these goals shall be the primary basis for evaluating the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.3.3 For each year that the plan encompasses, the unit<br/>member and administrator will complete the Evaluation Report, incorporating the unit member's self-<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4 Option II - Possible Evaluation Methods for Option II Plans - Shown<br/>below is a list of possible methods that may be used as part of developing a plan in Option II. These<br/>methods may be used by certificated unit members to demonstrate that the unit member has met the<br/>standards regarding the effective implementation of district curriculum, the utilization of instructional<br/>materials, student assessment practices and other important activities related to teaching. Upon<br/>completion of the evaluation, and the evaluatee has met the standards, the District shall return all media<br/>used in the evaluation to the evaluatee. Should the evaluatee partially meet standards or not meet<br/>standards, media used in the evaluation shall be retained by the District until the evaluatee has met the<br/>standards, at which time the District shall return all media used in the evaluation to the evaluatee. The<br/>evaluatee shall not subsequently use any media, which was created during work time, and/or with District<br/>material, which is returned to the evaluatee for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Videotape or audiotape feedback. This method refers to<br/>the recording by the teacher of an actual, live classroom episode on video or audiotape. The focus could<br/>be on the teacher's behavior or students' reaction to the improvements to classroom instruction. Such<br/>recordings are powerful in that they allow the teacher to see themselves from the students' perspective.<br/>The teacher's review of the taped records can involve the use of some data collection or observation<br/>instrument. For example, the teacher could chart frequencies of specified behaviors.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-ratina using a specified rating form. A self-rating form<br/>is a written form that requires the teacher to rank or grade themselves on a variety of dimensions or<br/>behaviors specified by the form. Such a form would primarily be useful as a starting point for evaluation.<br/>Such a form if developed by the participating teachers in a school could provide a conceptual framework<br/>for the dimensions of excellent teaching. Thus, for those teachers who did not know where to start in the<br/>self-evaluation process such a form might be helpful.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher maintained journal. Maintaining a journal of<br/>thoughts, reactions, progress, etc. focusing on a particular student, class, or one's teaching in general can</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>be a valuable tool for self-reflection and professional growth. The focus of the journal entries should be<br/>decided in the advance.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress through self-study materials. This method<br/>involves using some existing programmed materials for reviewing one's teaching style or to investigate<br/>alternative teaching techniques and materials. The materials typically would involve some general<br/>introduction and then a set of modules to work through which required some kind of response from the<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation and modeling of another teacher. The use of<br/>this method involves the observation by the teacher of examples of high quality teaching. Such<br/>observation, either in a class setting or on videotape allows the teacher to compare their teaching with<br/>that of the expert. The observation may be structured, in that the teacher knows prior to the observation<br/>that they are looking at a specific dimension of teaching, or unstructured, in that the teacher may be open<br/>to what they may discover.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher maintained Portfolios. Portfolios of lesson plans,<br/>instructional materials developed, student assessments used, or any other category of teaching products<br/>can be kept in a file and reviewed by the teacher as a way of constantly improving on what has been<br/>done or used. The purpose and criteria for including pieces in the portfolio can be maintained primarily<br/>for the self-reflective value to the teacher, a peer review of the content could also lead to some valuable<br/>insights.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student and/or parent surveys.</p>
<p>9.4.2.2.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other methods as agreed to by the unit member and</p>
<p>evaluator.</p>
<p>9.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an unsatisfactory evaluation, the unit member will participate in the Peer<br/>Assistance and Review (PAR) program and be evaluated during the subsequent school year.</p>
<p>9.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member receives two (2) ratings of one (1) on the final evaluation, the<br/>unit member may either self-refer to PAR or be re-evaluated the subsequent year. (See Article 12.1.9)</p>
<p>9.5 Specific Procedures</p>
<p>The District's right to determine evaluation procedures, as provided in Article 2, is limited by the<br/>specific agreements set forth in this article.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>AMENDED 3-19-13</p>
<p>9.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any written evaluation to be placed in the unit member's file shall be shared with the unit<br/>member prior to placement in the file.</p>

Unit members who work less than full<br/>time shall be entitled to that portion of the leave days as the number of hours per week of scheduled duty<br/>relates to the number of hours for a full-time unit member in a comparable position.</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all accumulated leave as set forth in 10.1.1 above is exhausted, additional non-<br/>accumulated leave shall be available for a period, not to exceed five (5) school months, provided that the<br/>provisions of 10.1.4 below are met. The amount deducted for leave purposes from the unit member's salary<br/>shall be according to the District Substitute Salary rates. The five-month period shall begin after the last day<br/>of expiration of the accumulated sick leave. The amount deducted shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the<br/>unit member's contract salary rate.</p>
<p>10.1.2.1 When a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave, including the leave<br/>authorized in section 10.1.3, and continues to be absent beyond the 5 month period provided in section</p>
<p>10.1.2, the employee shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a reemployment list for a period of<br/>24 months if the employee is on probationary status, or for a period of 39 months if the employee is on<br/>permanent status. When the employee is medically able, during the 24 or 39 month period, the certificated<br/>employee shall be returned to employment for a position for which he/she is credentialed and qualified. The<br/>24 or 39 month period shall commence at the expiration of the 5 month period provided pursuant to section</p>
<p>10.1.2 (Ed. Code §44978.1)</p>

<p>51</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>personal illness or injury and/or a medical authorization to return to work after an absence of five (5) days.<br/>Should a specific occasion and good reason require a doctor's certification in absences of less than five (5)<br/>days, the District reserves the right to request such information.</p>
<p>10.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit member must contact the Human Resources Department as soon<br/>as the need to be absent is known, but in no event less than two (2) hours prior to the start of the work day in<br/>order to permit the employer time to secure a substitute, unless an emergency prevents compliance. Failure<br/>to provide adequate notice may be grounds for denial of leave with pay or for other disciplinary action.</p>
<p>10.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In situations where a unit member is absent for less than a full day, he/she will have sick<br/>leave deducted based on the length of time a substitute is required for that day.</p>
<p>10.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall comply with the directions for the automated substitute service.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave</p>

Should a<br/>substitute not be available to replace a unit member, an alternate day may be selected when a substitute will<br/>be available. Before the utilization of personal necessity leave a unit member must obtain prior signature from<br/>the appropriate management person, except for cases of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, “c”, and &quot;d&quot;. (See Appendix I)</p>
<p>10.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment for such leave of absence shall be made only upon the employee's written<br/>statement requesting that the absence be charged against his/her sick leave and verifying that the absence<br/>was due to a personal necessity as set forth in 10.2.2.</p>
<p>10.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to ten (10) days of parental leave, deducted from sick leave, will be granted upon request,<br/>to the father at the birth of his child.</p>

<p>10.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to use sick leave as set forth in 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 for reasons<br/>caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom on the same terms<br/>and conditions governing leaves of absence from other illness or medical disability. Such leave shall not be<br/>used for child care, child rearing, or preparation for child bearing, but shall be limited to those disabilities as<br/>set forth above. The length of such disability leave, including the date on which the leave shall commence<br/>and the date on which the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the unit member and the unit<br/>member's physician.</p>
<p>10.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to leave without pay for disabilities because of pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom when sick leave as set forth in 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 has been<br/>exhausted.

<p>10.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member on leave for pregnancy reasons shall be entitled to return to a position<br/>comparable to that held at the time the leave commenced.</p>
<p>10.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member shall have the right to utilize personal necessity and sick leave for absence<br/>necessitated by child adoption. Such leave shall not exceed twenty (20) days.</p>
<p>10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Without Pay for Child-Bearing Preparation and Child Rearing</p>
<p>10.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave without pay may be granted to a unit member for preparation for child bearing and<br/>child rearing.</p>
<p>10.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall make the request to the Assistant Superintendent for Human<br/>Resources for such leave as soon as practicable. Such request shall be in writing and shall include a<br/>statement as to the dates the employee wishes to begin and end the leave without pay.</p>
<p>10.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination as to the date on which the leave shall begin and the duration of such<br/>leave shall be made at the mutual agreement of the employee and the Assistant Superintendent for Human<br/>Resources when considering the scheduling and replacement problems of the District.</p>
<p>10.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of such leave shall consist of no more than twelve (12) consecutive months and<br/>shall automatically terminate on June 30 in the school year in which such leave is granted. An extension of</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>leave may be granted, not to exceed an additional twelve (12) months.</p>
<p>10.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is not entitled to the use of any accrued sick leave or other paid leave while<br/>such employee is on child-bearing preparation leave or leave for child rearing, whether or not the illness or<br/>disability is related to a pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom.</p>
<p>10.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall not be a diminution of employment status for child bearing or child rearing except<br/>that no person shall be entitled to compensation or increment, nor shall the time taken on parental leave<br/>count toward credit for probationary teachers in earning tenure status.</p>
<p>10.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident Leave</p>
<p>10.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be entitled to industrial accident leave according to the provision in<br/>Education Code §44984 for personal injury, which has qualified for workers' compensation insurance.</p>
<p>10.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits in this paragraph are in addition to sick leave benefits. Accordingly, the<br/>employer shall not deduct accumulated sick leave from the sick leave allotment of a unit member who is<br/>absent as the result of an industrial accident or illness until the unit member has exhausted his/her right to<br/>industrial accident or illness leave.</p>
<p>10.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not exceed sixty (60) days during which the schools of the District are<br/>required to be in session or when the employees would otherwise have been performing work for the District<br/>in any one fiscal year for the same industrial accident.</p>
<p>10.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial Leave</p>
<p>10.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be provided leave for regularly called jury duty and to appear as a witness<br/>in court, other than as a litigant, for reasons not brought about through the connivance or misconduct of the<br/>unit member. The unit member shall submit notice to the Human Resources Department through his/her<br/>immediate supervisor for an approved absence no later than two (2) days after receipt of notice to appear.</p>
<p>10.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member, while serving jury duty, will receive pay in the amount of the difference<br/>between the unit member’s regular earnings and the amount received for jury service with the unit member<br/>retaining reimbursement for transportation and parking.</p>
<p>10.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>10.9.1 After completing seven (7) full school years of service in paid status, a unit member will be<br/>eligible to apply for sabbatical leave for the purpose of study/training related to professional development. In<br/>most cases, this study/training will occur at an accredited college or university. The sabbatical leave will not</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>exceed a one year period. It may also be granted in separate six-month periods provided that such leave is<br/>commenced or completed within a three-year period.</p>
<p>10.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants for sabbatical leave must submit their request to the Human Resources<br/>Department on the appropriate form by no later than December 1st of the school year preceding the school<br/>year in which the leave is requested. Such applications shall be reviewed for recommendation by a seven-(7)<br/>member committee, including four (4) members appointed by the President of the Association, one (1)<br/>member appointed by the S.M.E.T.A. President, the Assistant Superintendent for Educational Services and<br/>the Superintendent or her/his designee.</p>
<p>10.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent, subsequent to the committee's recommendation, shall make her/his<br/>recommendation to the Board of Trustees who shall grant or deny leave.</p>
<p>10.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on sabbatical leave will receive one-half of the salary and one-half of the fringe<br/>benefits they would have been paid during the period of leave on the appropriate salary schedule placement<br/>which would have been granted had the unit member not been on leave. No other compensation and benefit<br/>will be granted to those on leave, except that the unit member will be entitled to return to a position<br/>comparable to that which was held at the time of granting of leave. Upon return the unit member will advance<br/>on the salary schedule as if the service were continuous.</p>
<p>10.9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and conditions of the leave shall be agreed upon in writing, and shall include, but<br/>not be limited to: (a) a stipulation to a post-leave service of not less than two (2) full years for a full year of<br/>leave, and one (1) full year for a one-half year leave; (b) the description of the sabbatical program; and (c)<br/>appropriate reporting procedures as may be designated by the Superintendent or her/his designee. Should<br/>the program approved for a unit member on sabbatical leave be interrupted by accident, illness, or death in<br/>the family, during such leave, established by evidence, this fact will not constitute a breach of the conditions<br/>of such leave, or prejudice the unit member’s right to receive all benefits provided under this provision. If<br/>illness, injury or death, established by evidence, prevents the unit member from fulfilling his/her agreement to<br/>return to service in the District as per (a) above, no repayment of leave salary shall be required. Upon return<br/>from sabbatical leave, the unit member will be assigned to an appropriate position and insofar as possible,<br/>the employee's preferences will be considered in such assignment. Should the proposed assignment be<br/>made to a different position or school from which one-half year leave was taken, such assignment shall be in<br/>accordance with the transfer provisions of Article 7.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>05/19/2011</p>
<p>10.9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave for bargaining unit members shall not exceed two percent of bargaining unit<br/>staff nor one percent of the bargaining unit salaries in any fiscal year.</p>
<p>10.9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit members who are granted sabbatical leave will be required to post a bond. The<br/>bond will guarantee a return to District service for not less than twice the period of the sabbatical leave and in<br/>case of failing to return, to repay the District sabbatical leave salary proportionate to the time for which service<br/>is not rendered.</p>
<p>10.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave Without Pay - Part-time</p>

<p>10.11.3 Unit members on leave of absence without pay shall remain eligible to participate in District<br/>health, dental and life insurance programs at their own expense.</p>
<p>10.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application of this leave policy shall conform to the State and Federal Family and Medical Leave<br/>Acts.</p>

<p>10.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is suffering from an incapacitating illness or injury which is expected to<br/>continue for an extended period of time, as verified by the appropriate physician, and which prevents the unit<br/>member from performing his/her regularly assigned work. Verification shall set forth the diagnosis, prognosis<br/>and expected length of absence.</p>
<p>10.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time off work must create a financial hardship for the unit member because he/she has<br/>exhausted all accrued sick leave and any other paid time.</p>
<p>10.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for catastrophic leave credits shall run concurrently with sick leave with partial pay<br/>pursuant to Section 3 of this article, but in no event longer than twelve consecutive calendar months following<br/>the exhaustion of fully paid sick leave.</p>
<p>10.13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will not be eligible to use catastrophic leave credits unless they have<br/>previously donated sick leave credits to the reserve. Previously donated as used in this paragraph means<br/>having donated sick leave credits during the period as defined in 10.14.3 below.</p>

<p>10.14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Open Enrollment - During the 2007-2008 school year a special one-time open<br/>enrollment period will be available for any current bargaining unit members who have not contributed to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank. Employees who are currently in the Catastrophic Leave Bank will not be required<br/>to contribute during this special open enrollment period. Any employee who is not in the catastrophic leave<br/>bank and who elects not to contribute during this special open enrollment period shall have waived his or her<br/>right to participation in the program until such time as a mandatory open enrollment is held. (See section</p>
<p>10.14.6 below).</p>

However, employees who<br/>defer or decline enrollment may change their decision and opt to enroll at any time before the end of their first<br/>year of permanent employment by executing the enrollment form and contributing one day of sick leave. Any<br/>employee who fails to return the enrollment form by June 30 of their first year of permanent employment will<br/>be deemed to have declined enrollment until the next open or low-threshold enrollment period.</p>
<p>10.14.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low threshold enrollment - When the sick leave bank number falls below the threshold<br/>number, a low threshold enrollment will be held as determined by the Catastrophic Committee, where all unit<br/>members will be required to contribute an additional day to continue to participate. Sick leave credits may<br/>only be contributed during a low threshold open enrollment period specified by the Joint Association-District<br/>Catastrophic Leave Committee. Unit members who do not contribute during such open enrollment period<br/>may no longer participate in the Catastrophic Leave program and may not contribute or be eligible to use the<br/>bank until their participation has been initiated or restored by contributing during the next low threshold open<br/>enrollment period.</p>
<p>10.14.6.1 If a minimum of seventy-five (75) unit members fails to contribute sick leave<br/>credits to the leave bank in two consecutive open enrollments, the catastrophic leave provision in this article<br/>shall automatically be rescinded and any unused sick leave credits in the catastrophic leave reserve shall be</p>

<p>(SMETA) are committed to the goal of providing the highest possible quality education to all students. More<br/>than any other single factor, teachers influence what students learn and how well they learn it. Teachers,<br/>even the most skilled, must focus on continuous improvement in their professional practice. Therefore, both<br/>the District and the Association agree to cooperate in the design and implementation of a professional<br/>development program to improve the quality of instruction through expanded and improved staff<br/>development, peer assistance, and professional accountability.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) is to provide support for the<br/>improvement of professional practice, retain promising teachers and build professional knowledge to improve<br/>student success. PAR is intended as a critical feedback mechanism that allows exemplary teachers to assist<br/>their peers in improving their subject matter knowledge or teaching strategies or both.</p>

<p>12.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings The PAR Panel will establish its meeting schedule. Meetings may take place<br/>during the regular workday, in which members of the Panel will be released from their regular duties. If, in<br/>carrying out their responsibilities as members of the Panel, teachers find it necessary to work beyond the<br/>regular workday or work year, they will be compensated for such additional work in accordance with the<br/>Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>The Panel shall annually select a chairperson for the Panel. The Panel shall decide whether the<br/>chairperson should be from among teacher members or administrative members, or alternate the<br/>responsibility.</p>
<p>Minutes shall be kept for each meeting.</p>

<p>12.11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before April 1 of each year or after at least twenty (20) weeks of assistance, the Consulting<br/>Teacher shall prepare a final report for the PAR Panel to review, with a copy also submitted to the Referred<br/>Teacher and the Principal.</p>
<p>12.11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the teacher’s participation in the PAR Program shall be made available as<br/>part of the Referred Teacher’s annual evaluation. The evaluating Principal shall have the discretion as to<br/>whether and how to use the results in the formal evaluation. The Consulting Teacher’s report shall be made<br/>available to the District for placement in the Referred Teacher’s personnel file if referenced by the Principal in<br/>the formal evaluation.</p>
<p>12.11.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Referred Teacher will continue participating in the PAR Program until the PAR Panel<br/>determines the teacher no longer benefits from participation in PAR, or the teacher receives a satisfactory<br/>evaluation, or the teacher is separated from the District.
