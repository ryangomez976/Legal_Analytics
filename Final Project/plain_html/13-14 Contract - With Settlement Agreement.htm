<p>The OUHSD and the OSTA agree to close negotiations for 2012-2013 school year with<br/>no changes to the contract, except changes in dates, as written below:</p>
<p>ARTICLE I<br/>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>agreement (AGREEMENT) by and between the Governing Board of the Oroville<br/>Union High School District (BOARD) and the OSTA/CTA/NEA (ASSOCIATION)<br/>the employee organization.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Article I, Sections<br/>3540-3549 of the Government Code (ACT). It is the purpose of this Agreement to<br/>promote the improvement of personnel management and employee-employer relations<br/>within the Oroville Union High School District by providing a uniform basis for<br/>recognizing the right of public school employees to join organizations of their own<br/>choice and to be represented by such organizations in their professional and<br/>employment relationships with the governing Board and to afford certificated<br/>employees a voice in the formulation of educational policy.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until June 30, 2015.</p>

<p>3</p>
<p>ARTICLE III<br/>MAINTENANCE OF BENEFITS</p>
<p>The Board shall not reduce or eliminate any current provisions. Board policies, and/or rules and<br/>regulations within the scope of representation as defined by Chapter 10.7 Section 3543.2 of the<br/>Government Code provided unit members as of the effective date of this Agreement, unless otherwise<br/>provided by the express terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV<br/>NEGOTIATION PROCEDURE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the first Board meeting in February of each calendar year, both parties will have<br/>submitted their initial proposal for public input. No later than March 1 of each calendar year, both<br/>parties shall meet and negotiate in good faith. Any agreement reached between the parties shall be<br/>reduced to writing and signed by them. Such agreement shall be binding upon both parties.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board and the Association may discharge their respective duties by means of authorized officers,<br/>individuals, representatives or committees.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may utilize the services of outside consultants to assist in the negotiations.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall furnish the Association, upon request, with a copy of all County and State required<br/>reports, as well as copies of all budgetary and any other information that the Board or the<br/>Administration has which are necessary for the Association to fulfill its role as the exclusive<br/>bargaining representative.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations shall occur within five (5) working days of a written request for a meeting by either<br/>party at a mutually agreeable time and place.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items under negotiation which have been rejected by the Board shall be communicated with the<br/>Board’s reason(s) for such rejection, to the Association’s bargaining team, and vice versa.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of same, both parties have an obligation to review and reassess in good faith all<br/>available information and to seek additional information, if needed, in an effort to arrive at a<br/>mutually-acceptable decision.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide substitutes for five (5) representatives of the Association’s bargaining<br/>team, without loss of compensation, to attend negotiations, impasse proceedings, and fact-finding<br/>hearings.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties may mutually agree to negotiate any matter using interest-based bargaining (IBB) during<br/>the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ARTICLE V<br/>REPRESENTATION FEE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the Association, or who does not make application for<br/>membership within 30 days of the effective date of this Agreement, or within 30 days from the date<br/>of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit, shall become a member of the<br/>Association or pay to the Association a fee in an amount equal to membership dues, initiation fees<br/>and general assessments, payable to the Association in one lump-sum cash payment in the same<br/>manner as required for the payment of membership dues. In the event that a unit member does not<br/>pay such fee directly to the Association, the Association shall so inform the Employer, and the<br/>Employer shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in Education Code<br/>Section 45061 and in the same manner as set forth in this Article. There shall be no charge to the<br/>Association for such mandatory agency fee deductions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings include<br/>objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join or<br/>financially support the Association as a condition of employment; except that such unit member shall<br/>pay, in lieu of a service fee, sums equal to such service fee to one of the following non-religious, non¬<br/>labor organization, charitable funds exempt from taxation under Section 501 (c)(3) of Title 26 of the<br/>Internal Revenue Code:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Oroville, CA</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Red Cross</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive a religious exemption, the unit member must submit a detailed written statement<br/>establishing the basis for the religious exemption. The Association executive board shall<br/>communicate in writing to the unit member its acceptance or rejection of the exemption. If accepted,<br/>the unit member shall make the payment to an appropriate charity as described above. Such payment<br/>shall be made on or before the due date for cash dues/fees for each school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of payment shall be made on an annual basis to the Association and Employer as a condition of<br/>continued exemption from the payment of agency fee. Proof of payment shall be in the form of<br/>receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of payment, and to whom payment<br/>in lieu of the service fee has been made. No in-kind services may be received for payments, nor may<br/>the payment be in a form other than money such as the donation of used items. Such proof shall be<br/>presented on or before the due date for each dues/fees for each school year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit members making payments as set forth in sections above, and who requests that the<br/>grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement be used in her or his behalf, shall be responsible<br/>for paying the reasonable cost of using said grievance or arbitration procedures.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the Employer pursuant to sections above, whether for<br/>membership dues or agency fee, the Employer agrees to remit such moneys promptly to the<br/>Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members for whom such deductions have<br/>been made, categorizing them as to membership or non-membership in the Association, and<br/>indicating any changes in personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and Employer agree to furnish to each other any information needed to fulfill the<br/>provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance: A grievance is a claim by one or more unit members that there has been a<br/>violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision of this Agreement. A grievance<br/>must be filed at Level One of the formal level within fifteen (15) days of the date the grievant<br/>knew, or reasonably should have known, about the occurrence of the alleged grievance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferee: A conferee is a fellow employee, department head, supervisory administrator,<br/>employee organization representative or legal counsel.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant: A grievant may be any unit member, employee, group of unit members or the<br/>Association of the District covered by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day: A day is any workday for the unit member.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance Form: A grievance form is a mutually acceptable form developed by both parties to<br/>this contract.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Party: A party is the District, the grievant or their designated representatives.</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INFORMAL LEVEL</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant should attempt to resolve it by an informal</p>
<p>conference with his/her principal or immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FORMAL LEVEL</p>
<p>A. Level One: If a satisfactory solution is not achieved at the informal level, the grievant may,</p>
<p>within ten (10) days after the informal conference, present his/her grievances on the appropriate<br/>grievance form to his/her principal or supervisor. The form shall provide for the following<br/>information: A clear, concise statement of the grievance, the circumstances and people<br/>involved, the specific article, section or clause of the agreement allegedly violated, the decision<br/>rendered at the informal conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>1) The principal or supervisor shall communicate his/her decision to the employee in writing<br/>within five (5) days after receiving the grievance. If the principal/supervisor does not<br/>respond within the time limit, the grievant may appeal to the next level. Within the above<br/>limits, either party may request and shall be granted a personal conference. Either party<br/>may request the presence of one conferee.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level One, he may within ten</p>
<p>(10) days appeal the decision in writing to the District Superintendent. The written appeal<br/>request shall include a copy of the original grievance, the decisions rendered, and a clear,<br/>concise statement of the reasons for the appeal. The District Superintendent shall communicate<br/>his decision to the grievant within ten (10) days. If the Superintendent does not respond within<br/>the time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the next level. Within the above time<br/>limits, either party may request and shall be granted a personal conference. Either party may<br/>request the presence of one conferee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: If not satisfied with the decision at Level II, the grievant may, within ten (10)<br/>days, submit a written request for mediation of the grievance. In this event the District shall,<br/>within five (5) days, submit to the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service a written<br/>request for the services of a mediator.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function of the mediator shall be to assist the parties to achieve a mutually satisfactory<br/>resolution of the grievance. At the outset of this process, the mediator shall schedule a<br/>meeting at a mutually agreeable time for the purpose of resolving the matter through<br/>mediation.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is achieved by means of this mediation process,<br/>both parties to the grievance shall sign a written statement to that effect, and thus waive the<br/>right of either party to any further appeal for the grievance.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association have agreed that Level III may be waived by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Four: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision rendered at Level Two, or if no<br/>written decision has been rendered within ten (10) days of the meeting with the Superintendent<br/>or his designee or if not satisfied with the Level III mediation process, the grievant may, within<br/>a 10-day period after the timelines for Level III has elapsed, or mediation has been completed,<br/>submit a request in writing to the Superintendent for arbitration of the dispute. An impartial<br/>arbitrator shall be selected jointly by the grievant and, the District within ten (10) days of<br/>receipt of the written request. In the event that the parties cannot agree, the American<br/>Arbitration Association shall be requested to supply a panel of five (5) names. Alternate names<br/>shall be stricken until only one (1) remains. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and a court<br/>recorder, if required by the arbitrator, shall be shared equally between the District and the<br/>grievant. Additional expenses shall be borne by the party incurring such expenses.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, delete or alter any provisions of this Agreement,<br/>and shall limit his decision to the application and interpretation of its provisions. After<br/>reviewing the evidence, the arbitrator shall submit to the District and to the grievant, his<br/>findings and recommendations in writing. His decision shall be binding unless overturned by<br/>judicial review.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>4 WAIVER OF ARBITRATION</p>
<p>A grievant may waive the arbitration step and request that the District Board hold a hearing on the</p>
<p>grievance and render a final decision.</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JUDICIAL REVIEW</p>
<p>Nothing in this Article precludes a party from exercising his/her/its constitutional rights to have</p>
<p>access to judicial review.</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GUIDELINES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedures up to the arbitrational<br/>level by him/herself, or, at his/her option, by a conferee of the Association. If the grievant is<br/>not represented by the Association or its conferee, the Association shall still have the right to be<br/>present and to state its views at all stages of the grievance procedure. In the event a grievant<br/>chooses self-representation, no final resolution of a grievance shall be made by the District until<br/>the Association has received a copy of the grievance, any proposed solution, and has been<br/>provided an opportunity to file a written response. The Association must exercise its response<br/>privilege within ten (10) days of the receipt of the grievance and proposed solution.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Article shall be construed as preventing any party to a grievance from being<br/>represented by or seeking the advice and counsel of a conferee of their choice.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All communications required to be in writing shall be served by the United States Mail or<br/>delivered personally and shall be acknowledged by a signed receipt notice.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members required to be absent from their duties when directly involved in a grievance<br/>hearing as an Association representative or witness shall not suffer any loss of pay.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance file separate from all other employment records shall be maintained at the District<br/>Office for each grievance. All written materials relating to the grievance shall be maintained in<br/>this file.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing and processing grievances shall be prepared by the District Office in<br/>consultation with the Association, and copies shall be available at each school site office.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines as stated in the grievance procedure are maximums. Every effort should be made to<br/>expedite a grievance as quickly as feasible. If the grievance is filed at a time when summer<br/>schedules would make its resolution difficult, its processing may, by mutual consent, be held over<br/>until the opening of school in the fall.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance filed against a Level Two supervisor shall have its first hearing at the Level Two step<br/>of this procedure.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may, as an Association, grieve a contract right that is inherent to the Association<br/>as an entity, but a condition of employment must be initiated by a unit member or members.</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>HOURS AND DAYS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member is a professional person whose responsibility of employment is based on educational<br/>service rendered rather than a specified number of working hours. Not all professional duties can or<br/>need be performed at the school site. Therefore, the total length of the unit member day, including<br/>preparation time and duty free lunch, shall not exceed 7 hours and 30 minutes per day. The specific<br/>times to report to and leave from school will be mutually established at each school and will be<br/>indicated in the Faculty Handbook.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On days when unit members are scheduled to work but the students are not scheduled to be present,<br/>or on days of an emergency release of students or on minimum student days, the work day shall be<br/>seven and one-half (7-1/2) hours for all unit members, (inclusive of a thirty (30) minute lunch period)<br/>unless otherwise reduced by the District Management.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members shall be entitled to a 30-minute duty free lunch period. Unit members may leave<br/>the school grounds during their lunch period.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above required time period, unit members are responsible for other duties during the day.<br/>These duties will be assigned by the Administration as fairly and equally as is possible in meeting the<br/>needs of the school.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member will be responsible for participation in one back-to-school night and may be<br/>responsible for the supervision of one dance per year. (Refer to Paragraph Eleven (11) for unit<br/>members with less than a full-time assignment.)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School site principal may assign six (6) unit members including advisors per dance for only six<br/>(6) dances per year. For combined dances (2 per year) the total unit member supervision<br/>requirement will be twelve (12). Any additional dances that will require supervision will be<br/>acquired by the sponsoring clubs or group, and that supervision will be subject to the approval<br/>of the site principal.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance Duty assignments will be made by lottery after positions are filled by volunteers. Class<br/>advisors will not be considered volunteers. A unit member selected by lottery to fill a dance<br/>duty position will be placed into the lottery for the following year only if there are not enough<br/>unit members in the lottery to fill the positions that year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members assigned to supervise a dance may trade with another teacher for another<br/>assigned duty, i.e., yard duty, lunch duty, bus duty, etc. with the approval of the site principal.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon reasonable request by the Administration, unit members shall be responsible for other duties<br/>such as program development, professional growth activities, parent conference, committee<br/>assignments, faculty and district meetings, and special help to students.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each full-time unit member, with the exception of counselors and librarians, at each school shall<br/>teach a maximum of five regular teaching periods per day. Each full-time unit member, with the<br/>exception of counselors and librarians, shall have (under the six-period schedule) at least one (1)<br/>preparation period every day which is duty free and equivalent in length to that of a regular teaching<br/>period. During a unit member’s preparation period, he/she may be asked to volunteer, but he/she<br/>shall not be required to substitute for any other unit member who may be absent, with the exception<br/>of a bona fide emergency, such as a unit member’s sudden illness during a class. During the<br/>consultation period, unit members will be available for student related activities.</p>
<p>In case of the unavailability of a substitute, unit members may voluntarily substitute for other unit<br/>members. A unit member may be asked by the site administrator to provide substitute service during<br/>his/her preparation period. The unit member shall be compensated according to the following<br/>options:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) periods of accumulated substitutions can be used as one-half (1/2) day leave without<br/>regard to reason, subject to prior notice and scheduling approval of the site principal.</p>
<p>Scheduling decisions by the site principal shall be based upon reasonable consideration of the<br/>availability of coverage, or special circumstances, such as staff development days or<br/>accreditation activities, requiring the presence of the bargaining unit member. If the date<br/>requested is denied by the site principal, an appeal may be filed with the superintendent.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five (5) periods of accumulated substitutions can be used as one (1) day leave without regard to<br/>reason, subject to prior notice and scheduling approval by the site principal. Scheduling<br/>decisions by the site principal shall be based upon reasonable consideration of the availability of<br/>coverage, or special circumstances, such as staff development days or accreditation activities,<br/>requiring the presence of the bargaining unit member. If the date requested is denied by the site<br/>principal, an appeal may be filed with the superintendent.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensatory days for substitute periods may be accumulated from year to year, however, no<br/>more than ten (10) compensatory days may be carried over into the next school year, and no<br/>more than five (5) compensatory days may be used consecutively.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of scheduled work days for unit members shall be one hundred eighty-four (184) days,<br/>of which no more than 180 will be student contact days, as set forth in the school Board’s adopted<br/>“school calendar”. Prior to the first student contact day, there will be two days of in-service of which<br/>one half of one day shall be reserved for teacher classroom preparation. There shall also be one day<br/>of in-service between semesters, and one day of in-service on the closing date of school. (If extended<br/>year funding is withdrawn, the number of work days will revert to those specified in the 1983/84<br/>contract.)</p>
<p>For the in-service day between semesters, the District may have up to 2.5 hours for district in-service.</p>
<p>The remainder of the day will be allocated for certificated staff to prepare for the next semester. The<br/>district agrees that if there is not a need for an in-service, the entire day will be designated for<br/>teachers to prepare for the next semester.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors and Librarians: Each full time equivalent counselor/librarian shall work the 184 days<br/>determined by the annual school calendar. Each counselor/librarian shall be entitled to a thirty (30)<br/>minute duty-free lunch period during the 7-1/2 hour work day. An additional maximum of ten (10)<br/>work days if requested by the administration will be provided at the individual’s daily rate of pay, or<br/>the employee may opt to take compensation day(s) off in lieu of receiving their daily rate of pay,<br/>subject to prior notice and scheduling approval of the site principal. Scheduling decisions by the site<br/>principal shall be based upon reasonable consideration of the availability of coverage, or special<br/>circumstances, such as staff development days and accreditation activities, requiring the presence of<br/>the bargaining unit member. If the compensation date requested is denied by the site principal, an<br/>appeal may be filed with the superintendent.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening date of school, the closing date of school, and the established holidays shall be set by the<br/>District Superintendent in consultation with the Superintendents of the elementary feeder school<br/>districts, neighboring districts and Butte College.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT: Part-time employment is the number of regular teaching periods<br/>taught based on the five-period teaching day.</p>
<p>A full-time unit member’s day is 7 V2 hours, including a 30-minute duty free lunch period. Any part-<br/>time unit member should be responsible for time on campus commensurate with the percentage of<br/>pay said unit member is receiving. Since a 7 V2 hour day converts to 450 minutes, and since a duty<br/>free lunch of 30 minutes reduces the actual work time to 420 minutes, this is the basis upon which the<br/>following calculations are made.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(.2 FTE) is responsible for 84 minutes and no duty, but one back-to-</p>
<p>school night. (420 x .2 = 84 minutes)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2/5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(.4 FTE) is responsible for 168 minutes and one dance and one back-to-</p>
<p>school night. (420 x .4 = 168 minutes)</p>

<p>1. Unit members (excluding Counselors, Librarians, Athletic Directors, Activity Directors, and<br/>Specially Funded Programs) shall have a student contact cap as follows:</p>
<p>173 students to 1 unit member</p>
<p>195 students to 1 unit member in Physical Education</p>
<p>200 students to 1 unit member in Band/Music</p>

Unit members in a continuation high<br/>school or community day school may be assigned a maximum of twenty-three (23) students per<br/>class in each class in a five (5) period day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual class sizes may exceed the maximums set forth in Section A of this article by mutual<br/>consent of the individual unit member, the subject area coordinator, and the site administrator.</p>
<p>It will be executed in writing with copies filed at the site and with the OSTA Executive Board.<br/>The waiver will be in effect for one (1) semester. A waiver will not be permitted for unit<br/>members in Physical Education to go beyond the forty (40) students per class cap.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment of personnel shall be such that workloads are equalized within practical limits.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within any given subject area, a unit member may be assigned a class load of fewer than 173<br/>students per day. The difference in students will be absorbed by the school site.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part Time Employed: A unit member’s work load that is less than full time (FTE) will be<br/>computed as follows:</p>
<p>80% = 4 periods<br/>60% = 3 periods<br/>40% = 2 periods<br/>20% = 1 period</p>
<p>(138 students)<br/>(104 students)<br/>(69 students)<br/>(35 students)</p>
<p>F. OUHSD shall have fifteen (15) school days beginning with the first day of the school student<br/>calendar year to bring all classes within the class size provision noted above as it relates to the<br/>student contact caps and the maximum number of students allowed per period.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall employ a minimum of six (6) full time unit members as counselors beginning with<br/>the 2006/2007 school year. Initially three (3) of these counselors will be placed at each of the<br/>comprehensive high schools. Should enrollment at either of the comprehensive high schools change<br/>dramatically, the Association and District will meet to discuss alternate staffing patterns.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall employ a minimum of one (1) librarian.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX<br/>SAFETY CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be required to work under unsafe or hazardous conditions or to perform tasks<br/>which endanger their health, safety or well-being.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall continue to provide, at no cost to the unit member, total liability insurance<br/>coverage in the amount of not less than $1,000,000 in order to protect unit members from personal<br/>loss arising from any civil suit(s) brought against them in the performance of their duties.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written description of the rights and duties of all administrators and unit members with respect to<br/>student discipline, including the use of corporal punishment and the rights of suspended students, shall<br/>be presented to each unit member in writing in the teacher’s handbook.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained in said policy shall in any way limit the right of the unit member to use reasonable<br/>means, in connection with his/her employment, to protect himself/herself from attack, to protect another<br/>person or property or to quell a disturbance threatening physical injury to others. “In connection with<br/>his/her employment” includes, but is not necessarily limited to, any approved voluntary activity, field<br/>trip or school-sponsored event.

<p>ARTICLE X<br/>TRANSFERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer refers to any action which results in the movement, relocation or reassignment of a unit<br/>member to another campus which may be judged to meet fluctuations in enrollment, instructional<br/>requirements or the desire of a unit member for a change of assignments.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer may be unit member-initiated (voluntary) or Board initiated (involuntary).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a vacancy for a certificated position occurs in the District at any time other than the end of<br/>the school year, including vacation periods, all unit members shall be notified thereof. For all vacancies<br/>which will occur at the end of the school year, the following procedures will be utilized.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not later than March 15, a list of all known vacancies which will occur shall have been published<br/>by the Superintendent and copies shall be given to the Association president or his/her designated<br/>representative who shall post them in the main offices and in the faculty rooms of each school in<br/>the District.

When the request is made for a transfer to take effect<br/>during the school year, it shall be made within ten (10) working days of the notice of the vacancy.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of the request for a transfer is without prejudice to the unit member. It shall not<br/>jeopardize nor shall it be construed as an indication of dissatisfaction with his/her present<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reassignment, however, shall be requested before a conference has been held by the unit<br/>member with the principal of the school and/or the chairman of the department to which the unit<br/>member is currently assigned.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for transfer on file prior to posting of vacancies shall also be given consideration.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more than one (1) unit member applies for the same position, the unit member who has<br/>seniority in the District and who has the proper credentials to perform the required services shall<br/>be given first consideration for the transfer.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary transfer requests shall be given priority consideration over involuntary transfers.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a voluntary transfer request is denied, the unit member shall be provided with the specific<br/>reasons for the denial. All requests for the transfer on file in the District office shall become<br/>inactive on October 1 of the following school year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfers: Any transfer of unit member initiated by the administration (Board) shall be<br/>made in full cooperation with all parties concerned. Reasons for the transfer shall be given and the<br/>specific change of assignment shall have been discussed with the parties concerned, and expressly<br/>understood by those concerned, prior to any action being taken or any public announcement of<br/>contemplated action.</p>
<p>A. An involuntary transfer shall not result in the loss of compensation, seniority or any fringe benefit<br/>to a unit member.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be transferred for cause unless the Board has fulfilled it obligation to evaluate the<br/>unit member in accord with the procedures outlined in Article XIII, “Procedures for Evaluation of<br/>Certificated Staff”, of this Agreement.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>UNIT MEMBER TRAVEL</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedules of unit members who are assigned to more than one (1) school shall be arranged so that no<br/>such unit member shall be required to engage in unreasonable amount of inter-school travel, such as<br/>more than one (1) trip between schools per day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any driving in addition to driving to and from school in the performance of regularly assigned duties<br/>in the service of the District shall be reimbursed at the prevailing Board approved rate.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of District-Owned Cars:</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the conference, workshop or convention is of the type given in several sections within the<br/>State, the section closest to this area is the one in which travel allowance will be figured.</p>
<p>18</p><h5>ARTICLE XII<br/>PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS</h5>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to initial employment in the District, all unit members will file a certificate with the District<br/>Office, which will state examination within the past sixty (60) days and shows freedom from active<br/>tuberculosis.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examinations for tuberculosis will be required every four years. Such examinations shall be paid for<br/>by the District. The examination shall consist of a chest x-ray or an approved intra-dermal tuberculin<br/>test. If an intra-dermal tuberculin test indicates a positive reaction, it shall be followed by an x-ray of<br/>the lungs. Failure to comply with the above regulation will be considered sufficient cause for<br/>withholding a pay warrant and/or dismissal of said unit member (Ed Code 49406).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Office shall notify every unit member at least one (1) month in advance of the date their<br/>next examination for tuberculosis is due.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of any physical or mental examination required by the District of any unit member shall be<br/>paid for by the District over and above those costs paid for by the unit member’s health insurance.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>EVALUATION OF UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed by the Board and the Association that evaluation has one basic goal:</p>
<p>A continually improving educational program for the students of the District through the growth</p>
<p>and improvement, individually and collectively, of all unit members within the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, District policy and procedure for the evaluation of unit members shall be based on</p>
<p>the following premises:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the ultimate objective of evaluation is the continuing improvement of the total<br/>educational program. It is critical, therefore, that the responsibility for student progress be<br/>assumed by all personnel.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the evaluation be seen as a constructive effort, be positive in nature, be based on facts,<br/>and be frank and impartial.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper emphasis and consideration be given to the importance of a suitable learning<br/>environment which requires adequate support be given the educational program in terms of<br/>class size, supplies, equipment, materials, space and supportive personnel.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision shall be made for administrative and supervisory assistance designed to help<br/>all unit members within the District become more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That provision shall be made in both the District budget and calendar to ensure the<br/>necessary in-service training mutually agreed upon as required to achieve respect and<br/>confidence among all unit members engaged in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That no unit member shall be held accountable for any aspect of the educational program<br/>over which he/she has no authority or ability to correct deficiencies.</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROCESS</p>
<p>A. Selection of Evaluators</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of unit members will be performed by the Principal, the Assistant Principal<br/>or their administrative designee. The assignment of evaluators shall be the responsibility<br/>of the Principal. The Superintendent reserves the right to assign evaluators.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member to be evaluated may request that a second person from the District<br/>certificated staff of his/her choosing be involved in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>3) Moreover, if in the process of the evaluation procedure, or at the conclusion thereof, the<br/>unit member being evaluated should have a significant disagreement with the evaluator(s),<br/>he/she may request a new evaluation by a professional team. The professional team of<br/>three (3) shall consist of (1) the principal or his administrative designee, (2) a member<br/>selected from the District administrative staff by the unit member to be evaluated, and (3)<br/>the appropriate Subject Area Coordinator or a unit member mutually agreed upon by the<br/>principal and the unit member being evaluated.</p>
<p>B. Time Sequence</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 1st the unit members that are receiving formal evaluations will receive the<br/>following:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the evaluation procedures.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria upon which the evaluation is based.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of the evaluator.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary unit members will be provided with names of experienced individuals<br/>who may provide assistance (i.e., department chair, PAR Panel, assistant principal,<br/>consulting teachers, etc.)</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 15th the unit members to be evaluated shall establish:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Evaluator and Evaluatee will meet to review the goals and objective to be<br/>achieved as described in the pre-evaluation/goal/objective setting form. First<br/>observation shall be scheduled.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post observation meeting will take place within ten (10) working days.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1st of December the first formal observation for all probationary and temporary unit<br/>members shall be completed.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1st of February the second formal observation shall be completed for all temporary<br/>and probationary teachers.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1st of March all final summary evaluations shall be completed for all probationary<br/>and temporary unit members.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the 1st of May all final evaluation conferences for permanent unit members shall be<br/>completed with a copy of the evaluation given to the unit member.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each formal observation shall be followed by a post-conference at which the Evaluatee and<br/>Evaluator will discuss the observation in light of the total evaluation. This conference shall<br/>take place within ten (10) working days or less of the observation date unless mutually<br/>waived by both parties.</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each evaluation shall be followed by a post-conference at which the Evaluatee shall be<br/>shown the written evaluation and request to sign it. The signature shall signify that the<br/>Evaluatee has seen the evaluation but not necessarily that he/she agrees with it. Provision<br/>shall be made on the written evaluation for a written response from the Evaluatee to<br/>respond in writing within ten (10) working days.</p>
<p>9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member’s evaluator shall recommend action to correct any cited deficiencies and<br/>to enhance professional growth. Such action shall include specific recommendations for<br/>improvement, direct assistance in implementing such recommendations, and adequate<br/>release time for the unit member to visit and observe other similar classes in other schools<br/>or attend workshops.</p>
<p>10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent teachers who receive an unsatisfactory evaluation will be recommended to the<br/>PAR. An unsatisfactory evaluation is defined as any evaluation in which three (3) out of<br/>the first five (5) standards are unsatisfactory. An unsatisfactory standard is defined as any<br/>standard in which a majority of the bench marks are unsatisfactory. Standard number six</p>
<p>(6) may be used but will not be used to determine an unsatisfactory evaluation for PAR. If<br/>a concern arises concerning standard number six (6), a unit member may be required to<br/>attend in-service training for areas of concern. Any such required in-service shall take<br/>place during the regularly contracted work day.</p>
<p>11) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A probationary teacher will be evaluated at least twice per year until he/she reaches<br/>permanent status.</p>
<p>12) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent teachers will be evaluated at least once every two years but no more than once<br/>per year.</p>
<p>13) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every five years for personnel with permanent status who have been employed at<br/>least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec.<br/>7801, and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding<br/>standards, if the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree. The<br/>certificated employee or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time.</p>
<p>C. Criteria for Purpose of Evaluation</p>
<p>1) Evaluation shall be based on appendix E, F, G and H or other mutually agreed upon<br/>criteria.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIV<br/>ADULT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES</p>
<p>District and OSTA have agreed to the provisions of this article in recognition of the special conditions<br/>involved in the Adult Education Division (hereafter &quot;Adult Education&quot;). Adult Education is conducted by<br/>a combination of full-time and part-time hourly-compensated employees trained in the methods to meet<br/>the learning needs of the District's youth and adult population in the areas of essential skills, life learning,<br/>and vocational and occupational training. It is understood that apportionment for adult school programs is<br/>gained through teacher-student contact hours. While it is recognized that adult school personnel may be<br/>concurrently employed in other district programs, including, but not limited to, grades 9-12. It is the<br/>intention of the parties that the employment relationship described in this article, and the rights that flow<br/>there from, are separate and distinct from the rights that may accrue to the individual from other<br/>employment in the district. If there is any conflict between the terms of this article and the terms of other<br/>provisions of the agreement as they apply to Adult and continuing education, this article shall prevail.</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT AND RECOGNITION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All personnel in adult education programs shall be employed under contracts appended to this<br/>agreement. Employee contracts will be issued prior to each Adult school session. These<br/>contracts shall specify the duration of the employment, and shall terminate on or before June 30<br/>of the year in which they are issued. If the duration of the contract is to extend beyond June 30,<br/>a second contract shall be issued to cover the balance of the employment period. Teacher<br/>contracts must be signed and returned to the Principal or designee within ten (10) business days<br/>of issuance, or the contract is null and void. All teacher contracts require board approval.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract term for a person hired to complete the term(s) of employment of another person<br/>shall be for the duration of the original term(s). All contracts of employment shall be terminable<br/>at any time prior to expiration, but only for lack of funds, conclusion of special funding,<br/>elimination or reductions of the educational offering, insufficient enrollment or attendance,<br/>unsatisfactory performance, or any of the causes listed in Education Code 44932 et. seq.</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oroville Adult Education-CTC calendared sessions are based on the annually adopted<br/>Oroville Union High School District calendar. Three sessions, Summer, Fall and Spring, are<br/>approved each school year by the OUHSD Board of Trustees and then submitted to the CDE.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching assignments at the Oroville Adult Education-CTC can range from a portion of one (1)<br/>day to a maximum of two hundred forty-seven days. STRS/PERS FTE service credit is<br/>currently defined as 1350 hours worked during an Adult Education calendared year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-time teacher in Adult Education is defined as a person hired for a minimum of thirty (30)<br/>hours per week for 45 weeks.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time Adult Education teachers will receive the same benefit package as offered to OUHSD<br/>secondary teachers. Full-time teachers may be assigned to work a maximum of forty (40) hours<br/>per week.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members refer to those persons who are, by virtue of being assigned for thirty (30) or more<br/>hours per week, included within the bargaining unit.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>F. Every effort will be made to keep full time unit members in a full time status based on seniority<br/>within the District. Conversely, any reduction in hours will be made starting with the least<br/>senior member.</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult education assignments are based upon enrollment and attendance of voluntary students.</p>
<p>As attendance increases or decreases, so must staff assignments. When there is a reduction in<br/>adult school classes, first consideration will be given to maintaining adult school teachers’<br/>hours over grade 9-12 contract employees teaching extra hours in the adult school.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When possible, employees will be notified of their assignment two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks before the</p>
<p>beginning of each session. Employees may indicate a preference for a change of assignment by<br/>notifying the Principal in writing forty-five (45) days before the beginning of the next session.</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult School classes are expected to maintain a minimum ratio of sixteen (16) students per<br/>teacher hour assigned. Classes below this level are subject to closure by the administration of<br/>the Adult school.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class-size minimums will be reviewed on the fourth meeting of that class when they meet three</p>
<p>(3) or more times per week and on the second class when they meet two (2) or less times per<br/>week. In the event a class is to be closed at the above evaluation point(s), the OUHSD Assistant<br/>Superintendent or a designee will personally inform any instructor of the decision to close the<br/>class and the date/time of the final class meeting.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the teacher to report weekly to the Adult school administration any<br/>classes that fall below sixteen (16) students per hour for any attendance period. In the event that<br/>a course has fallen below the minimum hourly attendance of sixteen (16), the teacher is required<br/>to attach a note to his/her attendance sheet addressed to the Principal. The note will include the<br/>following information:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher name</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Course or program title</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours that the minimum standard of attendance was not met</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible reason (if known) for drop in attendance</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other information that needs to be shared</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes which do not meet the minimum class-size requirements described above may be<br/>continued at the discretion of the OUHSD Assistant Superintendent based on the following<br/>criteria:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is a &quot;start up&quot; or &quot;venture&quot; program</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is fee-based and financially self-supporting</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is legally mandated</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class is grant funded</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adult School administration agrees to continue the course</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent Study student assignments will be determined by school need and by mutual<br/>agreement between teacher and administrator. Full-time teaching status is defined previously in<br/>this article for Independent Study teachers.</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEACHER EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher evaluation for full-time instructors will follow Article XIII of the OSTA Collective<br/>Bargaining Agreement, using the same process and procedure that are in place for the Oroville<br/>Union High School District secondary teachers.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time teacher evaluations will be completed at the discretion of the Adult school Principal<br/>or designee.</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEAVES</p>
<p>A. Sick Leave shall be provided unit members on the basis of one (1) hour of sick leave for each<br/>eighteen hours worked and accrued if unused.</p>
<p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TEACHER PREPARATION TIME</p>
<p>A. Teacher Preparation Time may be awarded at the discretion of the Adult Education<br/>administration to teachers when:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding is available</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grant or partnership agreement supports and requires teacher preparation.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>ARTICLE XV<br/>PERSONNEL FILES</p>
<p>1. Each unit member shall have the right, upon request, to review the contents of his/her personnel file in</p>
<p>accordance with Education Code 44031.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representative of the unit member’s choosing may accompany the unit member in this review.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member shall have the right to examine and obtain copies of materials found in his/her file.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall keep a log indicating the persons who have requested to examine a personnel file,<br/>as well as the dates such requests were made. This log shall be available for examination by the<br/>unit member or his/her association representative, if so authorized by the unit member.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to personnel files shall be limited to the members of the District Administration on a need-<br/>to-know basis. Board members may request the review of a unit member’s file only at a personnel<br/>session of the entire Board.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVI<br/>COMPLAINTS REGARDING UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall not permit any public presentation critical of individual unit members at a public<br/>meeting of the Board of Education. Such presentations shall be heard in executive session and referred<br/>to the Superintendent or his designee for investigation.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXV<br/>PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW PROGRAM</p>
<p>1 PURPOSE OF PROGRAM</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is not to be used as a method to have teachers evaluate teachers. Evaluations are<br/>strictly the responsibility of the administration.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Education Code, Section 44500, et seq.. the primary purpose of the Peer Assistance<br/>and Review (PAR.) program is to address the instructional needs of permanent classroom<br/>teachers with unsatisfactory evaluations, as provided in Article XIII. A secondary purpose is to<br/>provide support to other certificated teachers through Consulting Teachers, staff development<br/>and beginning teacher assistance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oroville Union High School District and the Oroville Secondary Teachers Association are<br/>continuously striving to provide the highest quality of education for all students. In order for all<br/>students to succeed in learning, teachers must succeed in teaching. Therefore, the parties agree<br/>to cooperate in the design and implementation of the Peer Assistance and Review Program to<br/>improve the quality of instruction through expanded and improved professional development<br/>and peer assistance. Teachers who are referred to or who volunteer for the program are viewed<br/>as valuable professionals who deserve to have the best educational resources provided them in<br/>the interest of improving performance to a successful standard.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All activities undertaken pursuant to the peer assistance and review program are focused on<br/>maintaining and improving classroom instruction in the Oroville Union High School District.<br/>All such activities are independent of the evaluation function of administration as outlined in<br/>Article XIII. Except as provided by law, all communications between Referred Participating<br/>Teachers and Consulting Teachers are confidential.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oroville Union High School District and Oroville Secondary Teachers Association are<br/>committed to prioritizing the PAR Program in the following rank order, 1) to serve tenured<br/>teachers who receive unsatisfactory evaluations and 2) to fund other programs as determined by<br/>the Joint Panel as described in Ed Code 44500 and 44506.</p>
