<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Parties to Agreement</p>
<p>The Articles and provisions contained within this<br/>Agreement constitute an Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) by and<br/>between the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verde Unified School District</p>
<p>(&quot;District&quot;) and the Val Verde Teachers Association<br/>(&quot;Association&quot;).</p>
<p>Term of Agreement</p>
<p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from<br/>July 1 2012 to June 30, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take</p>
<p>place during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 and for 2013-2014<br/>each party will be able to renegotiate one additional<br/>article per side.</p>
<p>Interest Based Bargaining</p>
<p>This Agreement is the product of an &quot;interest based&quot;<br/>bargaining process. Interest based bargaining is based<br/>on the following assumptions: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bargaining&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enhances&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>relationship between parties; both parties can win in<br/>bargaining and they can help each other to win; open and<br/>honest discussion expands the areas of mutual interest<br/>and expands the options available to parties in<br/>negotiation; and, while power exists in any bargaining<br/>relationship, mutually developed standards move decision¬<br/>making away from reliance on power and toward satisfying<br/>the interests of both parties.

<p>24</p>
<p>acceptable date, time, and duration.

<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Party-In-Interest&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relates to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance:</p>
<p>Grievant or any person who might be required to take<br/>action or against &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action might be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken in</p>
<p>order to resolve a grievance.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose of the grievance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide a</p>
<p>means by which certain disputes may be resolved in an<br/>equitable and efficient manner. A grievance shall not<br/>include any employer-employee relations matters for which<br/>a different method of review is specifically provided by<br/>law other than the Act as defined in Section 7.1 above.</p>
<p>Association Grievance: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may file</p>
<p>grievances on its own behalf, which may be filed at the<br/>Superintendent's level and must be signed by the<br/>Association President and/or designee.</p>
<p>Level 1 - Informal Conference:</p>
<p>Before submitting a written grievance, the grievant shall<br/>first attempt to resolve the matter by requesting in<br/>writing an informal conference with the immediate<br/>supervisor. The grievant must request the informal<br/>conference within twenty (20) days after the act or<br/>omission giving rise to the grievance or within twenty<br/>(20) days of the date the grievant first knew or<br/>reasonably should have known the act or omission giving<br/>rise to the grievance.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The informal conference between the grievant and the<br/>immediate supervisor shall be held no later than<br/>five (5) days after the date the grievant requested<br/>the informal conference.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>results of the informal conference, the grievant may<br/>file a formal written grievance pursuant to Level 2<br/>in Section 8.5 below.</p>
<p>Level 2 - Immediate Supervisor</p>
<p>No later than five (5) days after the informal conference<br/>outlined in Level 1 above, the grievant may file a Level<br/>2 written grievance. A Level 2 written grievance must be <sup>36</sup></p>

<p>(a) The immediate supervisor must provide the grievant<br/>with a written statement of findings and decision<br/>concerning the grievance no later than five (5) days<br/>after the</p>
<p>receipt thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the grievant or the</p>
<p>immediate supervisor may request a conference to<br/>review the Level 2 written grievance, in which case<br/>the immediate supervisor shall have an additional<br/>five (5) days to provide the grievant with a written<br/>statement of findings and decision regarding the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>Level 3 - Superintendent</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>immediate supervisor's findings and decision, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>grievant may appeal the decision to the Superintendent or<br/>designee by completing and submitting to the<br/>Superintendent's office a District approved Level 3<br/>grievance form.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Level 3 grievance form must be submitted to the<br/>Superintendent's office no later than five (5) days<br/>after the grievant receives the supervisor's<br/>decision concerning the Level 2 grievance.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall have ten (10)<br/>days to issue a written statement of findings and <sup>37</sup></p>
<p>37</p>
<p>decision to the grievant. The Superintendent or<br/>designee may request an informal conference with the<br/>grievant to resolve the matter during this ten (10)<br/>day period.</p>
<p>Level 4 - Mediation</p>
<p>If dissatisfied with the decision at Level 3, no later<br/>than five (5) days after receipt of the Superintendent's<br/>or designee's decision, the Association may appeal by<br/>filing a Level 4 grievance and requesting mediation on<br/>the District approved Level 4 grievance form. The Level<br/>4 grievance form shall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be submitted to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>Superintendent's office.</p>
<p>(a) Within five (5) days after receipt of a Level 4<br/>grievance form, the Superintendent or designee shall<br/>request the California State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Service provide the parties with a<br/>mediator. Any fees resulting from the involvement<br/>of a mediator shall be shared equally by the<br/>parties.</p>
<p>(b) The parties shall cooperate with the mediator in<br/>scheduling any meetings necessary to attempt to<br/>resolve the grievance. The mediator shall attempt<br/>to bring the parties to a satisfactory agreement<br/>within five (5) days after initial arrival at the<br/>District office to meet with the parties to resolve<br/>the grievance. The mediator shall not, however, <sup>38</sup></p>
<p>38</p>
<p>have any authority to impose any settlement on the<br/>parties.</p>
<p>(c) If the Level 4 grievance is not resolved within five</p>
<p>(5) days after the mediator's arrival at the<br/>District to meet with the parties, the mediation<br/>shall terminate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not</p>
<p>satisfied with the results of mediation, it may<br/>appeal to Level 5 of the grievance process.</p>
<p>Level 5 - Arbitration</p>
<p>If a grievance is not concluded at Level 4 and the<br/>Association desires to appeal the grievance further, it<br/>shall be submitted to arbitration as set forth in this<br/>section. The Association, within five (5) days after the<br/>conclusion of mediation under Level 4, may request the<br/>matter be submitted to binding arbitration by filing a<br/>District approved Level 5 grievance form.</p>
<p>(a) Upon the District's receipt of a Level 5 grievance<br/>form, the parties shall endeavor to agree upon an<br/>arbitrator. If no agreement is reached within ten<br/>(10) days, the parties shall proceed under the<br/>Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American<br/>Arbitration Association (&quot;A.A.A.&quot;) and shall request<br/>A.A.A. supply the parties with a panel of seven (7)<br/>names of arbitrators. Each party shall alternately<br/>strike a name until only one (1) name remains, who<br/>shall be the arbitrator. The party who strikes the <sup>39</sup></p>
<p>39</p>
<p>first name shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees of the arbitrator shall be shared equally<br/>by the parties. Either party may request a<br/>transcript of the proceedings and the party<br/>requesting shall bear the cost. If both parties<br/>request a transcript, they shall each bear one-half<br/>(1/2) of the expense. Each party shall bear the<br/>expense of the presentation of its own case. All<br/>such meetings shall be conducted after the<br/>employee's workday, unless the arbitrator schedules<br/>otherwise. In such event, the District shall only<br/>be required to provide release time to the grievant,<br/>one WTA representative and employees who are<br/>witnesses for the reasonable time required.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend,<br/>change, modify, add to or subtract from any of the<br/>terms of this Agreement. The decision of the<br/>arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence<br/>and arguments presented by the respective parties in<br/>the presence of each other. No decision shall be<br/>retroactive beyond the beginning of the twenty (20)<br/>work day period specified in Section 8.4 above. The<br/>arbitrator shall hear and issue a decision upon one<br/>grievance at a time unless the District and WTA<br/>expressly agree otherwise.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of the California Code of <sup>40</sup></p>
<p>40</p>
<p>Civil Procedure and this Agreement's specific<br/>exclusion of issues from the grievance-arbitration<br/>process, the decision of the arbitrator shall be<br/>final and binding upon the parties to this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievance not processed by a grievant in<br/>accordance with the time limits set forth herein<br/>shall be considered settled on the basis of the last<br/>decision made by the District. If at any step the<br/>District fails to respond in a timely manner, the<br/>grievant may proceed to the next step. Any of the<br/>time limits set forth in this Article may be waived<br/>by written agreement between the parties. Any of<br/>the levels of procedures in the Article may also be<br/>waived by written agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant shall be entitled, upon request, to<br/>representation by the Association at any grievance<br/>meeting. Where the Association has not been<br/>requested to represent the grievant and the District<br/>is prepared to agree to a resolution of the<br/>grievance, the District shall not make any final<br/>resolution until the Association has received a copy<br/>of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has<br/>been given an opportunity to submit a written</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>response. <sup>41</sup></p>

<p>(b) Once a vacancy has been established, that is<br/>eligible for transfer, and a unit member has<br/>requested a transfer during the established period to<br/>such vacancy, an interview shall be scheduled at the<br/>school or site.</p>
<p>(c) The interview team shall consist of up to two site<br/>administrators, two unit members from the grade<br/>level, department/program, and a member of the<br/>leadership team. In the event a school site does<br/>not have the required members for the interview team<br/>the administrator will notify the Human Resources,<br/>Assistant Superintendent.</p>

<p>Involuntary Transfer</p>
<p>The District shall have sole discretion in determining<br/>whether or not a vacancy exists and whether or not to<br/>fill a vacancy with an involuntary transfer. The<br/>following procedures shall apply:</p>
<p>(a)The District may involuntarily transfer an employee<br/>at any time for the following reasons only:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When special funding for a categorically funded<br/>program at a site is reduced, eliminated, or<br/>enhanced;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accommodate a change in school enrollment or<br/>reorganization of staff;</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an emergency (defined as school<br/>closure, fire, natural disaster or similar<br/>occurrence);</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the involuntary transfer is necessary due<br/>to programmatic needs within the District.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the transfer is necessary to adhere to<br/>state or federal compliance requirements.</p>
<p>(b) The District's Human Resources Department shall give<br/>the affected employee and the site administrator<br/>written notice of the impending change. Following<br/>written notification, the affected employee may</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>request written reasons for the change. The<br/>employee may also request a conference with his/her<br/>site administrator or the District's Human Resources<br/>Department to discuss the change.</p>
<p>(c) Involuntary transfers shall not be arbitrary or<br/>capricious.</p>
<p>(d) Teachers assigned at grades TK-5 shall not be<br/>involuntarily transferred after October 1 beyond<br/>three grade levels for the remainder of the school<br/>year. A site or District administrators- shall meet<br/>with each unit member prior to an involuntary<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>(e) Release time of one day shall be provided to unit<br/>members who are notified of an involuntary transfer<br/>to a different school site prior to the end of the<br/>current school year.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time of two days shall be provided to TK-5<br/>unit members who are involuntarily transferred and<br/>are required to be relocated to a different school<br/>site after the start of the school year.</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an employee has been involuntarily transferred,<br/>he/she cannot be involuntarily transferred for two<br/>(2) years from the effective date of the new<br/>assignment, except in the case of an involuntary<br/>transfer necessitated by a school closing, school<br/>opening, change to year-round education or reduction</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>of special funding for a categorically funded<br/>program.</p>
<p>(h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request to the site administrator, the District<br/>shall provide assistance in moving a unit member who<br/>will be involuntarily transferred.</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers that are a result of; the<br/>elimination of a program, change in enrollment, an<br/>emergency, or when transfer is necessary to adhere<br/>to state or federal compliance requirements, will be<br/>determined by first requesting volunteers, at the<br/>impacted school site. In the event no unit member<br/>volunteers to transfer then the unit member, at the<br/>impacted site, with the least district seniority<br/>will be involuntarily transferred.</p>
<p>(j) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the last contract day of the school year,</p>
<p>WTA shall designate and notify the Human Resource<br/>Department designee of all site representatives at<br/>each school site who shall not be subject to<br/>involuntary transfer between the months of June<br/>through March. The District retains the right to<br/>confer with WTA, should the site representative<br/>fail to maintain their professional obligations as<br/>an educator. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WTA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dismisses the site</p>
<p>representative, the unit member will lose protected<br/>status as a site representative.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Reassignment</p>
<p>By the seventh (7<sup>ch</sup>) calendar day prior to the last<br/>contract day, the site administration will give the unit<br/>member a written tentative grade level/assignment for the<br/>following school year.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>ARTICLE FIFTEEN</p>
<p>LAY-OFFS</p>
<p>Procedures</p>
<p>In the event that the District's Board of Education<br/>determines that it has become necessary by reason of any<br/>of the conditions set forth in Education Code sections<br/>44955 or 44955.5 to decrease the number of certificated<br/>employees, said lay-off shall be conducted according to<br/>the applicable provisions of the Education Code. For<br/>purposes of a lay-off, a unit member's seniority shall be<br/>based on the date upon which the unit member first<br/>rendered paid service in a probationary position for the<br/>District and shall be determined according to the unit<br/>member's placement on the District's certificated<br/>bargaining unit seniority list. The District, however,<br/>may deviate from terminating a unit member in order of<br/>seniority for any of the reasons set forth in Education<br/>Code section 44955(d).</p>
<p>Notice to the Association</p>
<p>At least fifteen (15) calendar days before mailing out<br/>notices of lay-off, the District shall send via U.S.<br/>certified mail, return receipt requested, to WTA a list<br/>of the positions to be eliminated and the reasons</p>
<p>therefore.</p>
<p>Notice to the Unit Member</p>
<p>No later than ten (10) calendar days after the District<br/>mails notices of lay-off to affected unit member, the<br/>District shall send to each affected unit member via U.S.<br/>certified mail a list of unit members it intends to lay¬<br/>off containing their seniority dates and numbers. At the<br/>same time, the District shall deliver a copy of such list<br/>to the Association.</p>
<p>Priority</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided by statute, no permanent<br/>certificated unit member may be laid-off while any<br/>probationary certificated unit member is retained to<br/>render a service which said permanent certificated unit<br/>member is certificated and competent to render.</p>
<p>Development of the Certificated Seniority List<br/>On May 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1992, representatives of the District and WTA</p>
<p>mutually participated in the development of a<br/>Certificated Seniority List to determine the order of<br/>seniority for all unit members. The order of seniority<br/>for unit members who first rendered paid service on the<br/>same date was determined by a random selection process<br/>agreed to and conducted by the parties. The certificated<br/>seniority list shall be revised annually to include new<br/>unit members and delete unit members who have been<br/>separated from District employment. During any revision,<br/>a random selection process agreed to and conducted by the</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>parties shall be utilized to determine the order of<br/>seniority for new employees who first rendered paid<br/>service on the same date. The certificated seniority<br/>list shall also be revised prior to the implementation of<br/>any lay-off.</p>

<p>ARTICLE TWENTY</p>
<p>EVALUATION PROCEDURES<br/>Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>The District has adopted the California Standards for<br/>the Teaching Profession which shall serve as the basis<br/>for performance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluations of certified unit</p>
<p>employees. The adopted standards are listed on the<br/>Teacher Evaluation Form.</p>
<p>Philosophy:</p>
<p>Evaluation of the performance of unit members is an<br/>important element of the District's educational<br/>mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance evaluation is a tool by which</p>
<p>site administrators and supervisors can acknowledge<br/>employees whose performance exceed expectations. In<br/>addition, performance evaluation provides the best<br/>means to identify unit members who are in need of<br/>improvement and assistance. Both the District and WTA<br/>seek to provide the best teachers possible for the<br/>District's students.</p>
<p>Competency:</p>
<p>The competency of each unit member shall be evaluated<br/>as it reasonably relates to the following:</p>
<p>(a) The progress of a unit member toward the standards<br/>established by the District pursuant to section</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>20.1 above.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress of pupils toward standards</p>
<p>established by the District of expected pupil<br/>achievement of each grade level in each area of<br/>study.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructional techniques and strategies used</p>
<p>by each employee.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee's adherence to curricular<br/>obj ectives.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establishment and maintenance of a suitable</p>
<p>learning environment within the scope of each<br/>employee's responsibilities.</p>
<p>Frequency:</p>
<p>All probationary teachers shall be evaluated in writing<br/>no less than once each year. All permanent teachers<br/>shall be evaluated in writing no less than once every<br/>two (2) years, except that whenever a permanent<br/>employee has received a performance rating of<br/>unsatisfactory with respect to two (2) or more of the<br/>State Standards, the employee shall be evaluated in<br/>writing annually until the employee achieves a higher<br/>overall performance rating or is separated from<br/>District employment. At least every five years for<br/>personnel with permanent status who have been employed<br/>at least ten (10) years as a certificated employee with<br/>the school district, are highly qualified, if those<br/>personnel occupy positions that are required to be</p>

<p>November 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2001)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rules&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be</p>
<p>used in determining initial step and column<br/>placement on the District's salary schedule for<br/>new employees:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for initial step placement<br/>shall not affect the salary placement of<br/>employees hired to begin work in the<br/>District prior to July 1, 1998.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Step Placement:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employees</p>
<p>hired after July 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1998, the maximum</p>
<p>allowable step credit shall be up to 11<br/>years. New employees with a Bachelor's<br/>Degree shall receive one year of step<br/>credit for each prior year of successful<br/>teaching experience in accredited public<br/>or private schools, at grades K-12, up to<br/>the maximum allowable step credit provided<br/>in this Article. To receive step credit, a<br/>new employee must have successfully taught<br/>under a full-time, regular contract for<br/>more than three-fourths of the school year<br/>and held a valid teaching credential.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All prior service and units for initial<br/>salary placement will be evaluated and<br/>determined by the District. New employees<br/>will not be permitted to obtain additional</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>column advancement during their first year<br/>of employment beyond their initial salary<br/>placement by the District.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;require a new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit</p>
<p>member to verify salary placement by<br/>supplying official &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transcripts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of</p>
<p>completed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work within forty-five&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(45)</p>
<p>calendar days of hire date.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One half of the semester or quarter units</p>
<p>earned beyond the B.A. degree must be for<br/>graduate level credit courses. No course<br/>with a grade below &quot;C&quot; or the equivalent<br/>will receive credit. Units beyond a given<br/>degree level refer to units earned after<br/>the applicable degree is granted. Earned<br/>units shall be applicable to the salary<br/>schedule &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course units&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are</p>
<p>acceptable for renewal or attainment of a<br/>teaching credential or the course units<br/>are applicable to an advanced degree in an<br/>educational field or the course units are<br/>in professional education courses.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All units applicable to the salary<br/>schedule shall be earned at an accredited<br/>(National Association of Universities and<br/>Colleges) college or university.</p>

<p>Step and Column Advancement</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After initial placement on the salary<br/>schedule, advancement on the schedule<br/>shall be controlled by credits/degrees<br/>earned and years of service in the<br/>District. A unit member will qualify for<br/>a step advancement salary increase when<br/>the employee completes the years of<br/>service (75% of a school year) set forth<br/>on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>(b) Unit members will qualify for a column<br/>advancement salary increase based on<br/>course work when the employee obtains the<br/>total number of semester units set forth<br/>on the salary schedule as required for the<br/>advancement, and submits the Letter of<br/>Intent form to the District<sup>1</sup> s Human<br/>Resources Department by June 1. Quarter<br/>units earned by a unit member shall be<br/>converted to semester units for the<br/>purpose of applying the units to the<br/>salary schedule by multiplying the quarter</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>units by two-thirds.</p>
<p>(c) The number of semester or quarter units<br/>for a column change must be a whole number<br/>at least equal to the number set forth on<br/>the salary schedule. Fractional parts of<br/>semester or quarter units may be added to<br/>arrive at the whole number of semester or<br/>quarter units required.</p>
<p>(d) One half the semester or quarter units<br/>earned beyond the B.A. degree must be for<br/>graduate level credit courses. No course<br/>with a grade below &quot;C&quot; or the equivalent<br/>will receive credit. Units beyond a given<br/>degree level refer to units earned after<br/>the applicable degree is granted. Earned<br/>units shall be applicable to the salary<br/>schedule if the course units are<br/>acceptable for renewal, attainment of a<br/>teaching credential, the course units are<br/>applicable to an advanced degree in an<br/>educational field, or the course units are<br/>in professional education courses.</p>

<p>(1) Course Work Approval: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All course</p>
<p>work intended to be used for column<br/>advancement must receive written<br/>approval from the Human Resources<br/>Department when taking courses other<br/>than those required for an existing<br/>or a new type of credential. The<br/>employee shall obtain a Course Work<br/>Approval form from the District's<br/>Human Resources Department. A copy<br/>of the completed Course Work Approval<br/>form shall be provided to the</p>
<p>94</p>

<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Official Transcript:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee</p>
<p>shall request from his/her college or<br/>university that an Official<br/>Transcript be provided to the<br/>District's Human Resources Department<br/>verifying the completion of course<br/>units &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;column</p>
<p>advancement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall</p>
<p>ensure that his/her Official<br/>Transcript is filed with the<br/>District's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources</p>
<p>Department.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be entitled to a<br/>column advancement salary increase<br/>within three (3) months or three (3)<br/>regular pay periods, whichever is<br/>longer, from the date the Human<br/>Resources Department's receives all<br/>proper documentation, and the<br/>District shall pay the employee the<br/>appropriate salary increase within<br/>that time. The salary increase shall<br/>not be retroactive to the date of<br/>qualification; however, the employee</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>shall be entitled to daily interest<br/>from the date of qualification if the<br/>District fails to pay the salary<br/>increase within the established time<br/>frame of three months or three<br/>regular pay periods, whichever is<br/>longer.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the employee's responsibility<br/>to ensure that proper verification of<br/>education, all applicable forms, and<br/>all proper documentation are received<br/>by the District's Human Resources<br/>Department in order to receive timely<br/>payment for the column advancement.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Preschool/Headstart Instructor may<br/>not advance more than one step on the<br/>salary schedule applicable to such<br/>employees in any one school year.</p>
<p>Extra Duty Compensation</p>
<p>(a) The policies and procedures for selection and<br/>compensation of employees who perform extra duties, such<br/>as coaching and academic advisor positions, are set forth<br/>in Appendix A.

<p>duty positions available during a given school year<br/>shall be based upon the level of student<br/>participation in the academic activity, the<br/>availability of staff, funds and District needs as<br/>approved by the Board of Education. Extra duty<br/>positions, other than high school athletic coaches,<br/>terminate on or before June 30. The District retains<br/>sole discretion in determining which positions<br/>listed in Appendix G, if any, will be filled and may<br/>annually rehire a unit member to serve in a given<br/>position.</p>

<p>completed within a semester will be paid at the end<br/>of the semester. Stipends for activities that take<br/>place over two semesters will be paid at the end of<br/>the spring semester.</p>
<p>(j) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments for extra duty assignments which are</p>
<p>seasonal, or are for less than one (1) school year,<br/>shall be made on the paycheck issued during the pay<br/>period following the date which is thirty (30)<br/>calendar days after the end of the activity or<br/>athletic season. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may withhold</p>

<p>President, WTA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Val&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verde&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unified&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>BETWEEN THE VAL VERDE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>AND THE VAL VERDE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION<br/>TO ESTABLISH A SICK LEAVE DONATION PROGRAM</p>
<p>The District and the WTA have established a Sick Leave Donation Program to<br/>which WTA Bargaining Unit Members may irrevocably donate their accrued sick<br/>leave on behalf of other members suffering from catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of this MOU is for employees in the certificated bargaining<br/>unit to be able to assist fellow bargaining unit employees with<br/>catastrophic illness or injury, who have exhausted their full-time sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected<br/>to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time. Examples<br/>include, but are not limited to, life threatening injury or illness; cancer;<br/>heart surgery; or stroke.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may donate up to a maximum of 2 days of their accrued sick<br/>leave per fiscal year. All sick leave donations are made in full days, not<br/>partial days or hours. All donations are irrevocable. Donations will be<br/>made between July 1 and October 31 of each school year. Employees<br/>returning from extended leave which included the enrollment period and<br/>new hires will be permitted to contribute within 30-calendar days of<br/>beginning work. In addition and from time to time as the committee<br/>deems necessary the committee may seek additional calls for donations.<br/>Donation and withdrawal forms will be available from the WTA.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the sick leave donation program is voluntary, but requires<br/>a minimum donation of 1 day per school year. Beginning July, 2006<br/>only current contributors will be permitted to request a withdrawal.<br/>Participation in the voluntary sick leave sharing program is not subject to<br/>the Grievance Procedure in die Bargaining Agreement between the<br/>District and the WTA or District policy.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests to receive sick leave shall be approved by the 3 member<br/>Catastrophic Dlness/Injury Committee consisting of 2 members<br/>designated by the WTA President and 1 member designated by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>6. Sick leave may be approved by the Catastrophic Illness/Injury</p>
<p>Committee for donation to an employee if all of the following</p>
<p>requirements are met:</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee is suffering from a catastrophic illness or injury<br/>requests that sick leave be donated and provides verification of<br/>catastrophic injury or illness as required by the Committee.<br/>Applications for withdrawal or extensions of withdrawal will be<br/>accompanied by a doctor’s statement indicating the nature of the<br/>illness or injury and the probable length of absence.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee determines that the employee is unable to work<br/>due to the employee’s catastrophic illness or injury for an<br/>extended period of time.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee determines that the employee’s catastrophic<br/>illness or injury will cause the employee to exhaust all fully paid<br/>sick leave, thereby necessitating the donation.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted<br/>in units of no more than 30 duty days. Requests for extensions of<br/>withdrawals may be submitted to the committee as prior grants<br/>expire. If an individual is incapacitated, applications may be<br/>submitted to the committee by the participant’s agent or family<br/>member.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of time that donated leave credits may be<br/>used per employee is in conjunction with the up to 100 work days<br/>provided under Section 11.8 of the VVTA Agreement. Thus,<br/>should the catastrophic illness or injury continue for any<br/>employee beyond the 100 work days, additional days may not be<br/>approved by the Committee for that employee.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of the sick leave credit approved by the Committee<br/>would be as follows: Assume that individuals have donated 50<br/>days of sick leave to the sick leave pool. Assume that two<br/>individuals have been approved by the Committee for receiving<br/>sick days. Assume that each individual has accrued 20 days of<br/>unused sick leave. Per Section 11.8 of the VVTA Agreement,<br/>each individual would be entitled to up to 100 work days of the<br/>lesser of either 50% of salary or the cost of a substitute. It is<br/>agreed that each day of donated sick leave will equate to one-half<br/>of a day for an employee on extended illness leave, so that the<br/>assumed 50 days will equate to 100 half days. Thus, each</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>employee would be eligible for 100 half days of pay when<br/>combined with his/her entitlement under Section 11.8 will result<br/>in the employee receiving full pay for up to 100 work days. Thus,<br/>there is not a strict conversion of days into dollars, but rather,<br/>each donated day equals two half days, so that the employee may<br/>continue to receive full pay as a result of receiving the extended<br/>illness leave and the donated half day.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, the Committee may solicit donations of sick<br/>leave from the bargaining unit due to actual or anticipated need.<br/>The Committee may state the name of the employee and may,<br/>with the employee’s permission, state the general nature of the<br/>catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees working on a part-time basis or in the Pre-School<br/>Head Start Program will have a pro-rated amount as determined<br/>by the Committee regarding days to be donated or to be requested.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District, through its Business Division, will track the number of days<br/>donated and utilized and provide such information as needed to the<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pilot program that will become effective immediately and will<br/>be in place through June 30, 2007. In the Spring of 2007, the negotiating<br/>teams for the District will review this program. Should the program not<br/>be continued, any days not utilized will be returned to the donors on a<br/>pro-rata basis, as determined by the Committee.</p>
<p>The following forms will be utilized for implementing the Sick Leave Donation<br/>Program pursuant to this MOU between the District and the VVTA.</p>
