<p>single-track, with additional days for activities as prescribed by the District not to exceed</p>
<p>six (6) for Members on traditional or single track, and an additional day for Members new</p>
<p>to the District.</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic calendars for each school year will be negotiated in November<br/>prior to the beginning of the next school term.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any modification at a school site of the adopted District calendar, which involves<br/>changing the work dates of the adopted calendar, will be negotiated.</p>

<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Psychologists shall have a 195 day work year and work 8 hours per day<br/>(exclusive of lunch)</p>
<p>Work Dav</p>
<p>5.2.1 The length of the work day for all Members, except part-time Members, shall be 6<br/>hours and 30 minutes (exclusive of the lunch period and inclusive of 45-minutes<br/>of preparation time). The work day for K-6 teachers shall begin 30 minutes<br/>before the Member’s first scheduled class meeting with students. This time is not<br/>a stipulation of a limit as to the work required as it is understood the professional<br/>status of the educator makes it desirable and necessary that substantially more<br/>than six hours and thirty minutes is and always will be required to complete<br/>preparation and other work necessary to satisfactorily execute the responsibilities<br/>of the contract. For grades 7 and 8 the following minimum and maximum minutes<br/>shall apply: The teacher-pupil instructional contact time for grades 7 and 8 shall<br/>not be less than 300 minutes, including homeroom but excluding passing time,<br/>and a maximum of 319 minutes which will include passing time and homeroom.</p>

<p>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are times when the Members cannot avoid transacting school-related<br/>business or personal business away from the school site during the prescribed<br/>work day. Such things as meetings, library preparation, doctor and dental<br/>appointments, attending early classes in furtherance of their education and<br/>personal business that cannot be transacted at another time, would be examples<br/>of the type of things that would necessitate such departure. Reasons are not<br/>limited to the above, but the above are typical examples that would permit<br/>absence from the school site. It is understood that the latitude on departure time<br/>applies only to those times when the Member is not scheduled to be conducting<br/>classes and does not have other scheduled responsibilities as discussed below.<br/>Such departure does not relieve the Member of the responsibility for attending<br/>curriculum, staff and parents' organization meetings, parent-teacher conferences,<br/>principal-teacher conferences, or other assigned regular and special duties.</p>
<p>When a Member plans to leave the school site during the work day, exclusive of<br/>the lunch periods, the site administrator must be notified through a sign-out sheet<br/>the day prior to such departure. If departure is on school business, notifying the<br/>site secretary will be sufficient notice. Absence from the school site will normally<br/>be limited to one (1) hour and shall occur on an infrequent basis when &quot;related&quot; to<br/>non-school &quot;related&quot; business as described above.</p>
<p>5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of emergency, which will be described by the Member on request, the<br/>sign-out sheet shall have a section to indicate that prior day's notice was not<br/>possible. Emergency departures which exceed one (1) hour will require the<br/>utilization of Personal Necessity Leave (Article VI, Section 6.4). At the end of<br/>each month the sign-out sheets shall be reviewed as necessary by Human</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Resources.</p>

<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular lunch period shall be equivalent to the student lunch period, less the<br/>time necessary for coverage of student passage, but in no instance will the lunch<br/>period for a Member be less than forty (40) consecutive minutes.</p>
<p>5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of inclement weather, which causes student return to the classroom<br/>earlier than the normal lunch period, every effort will be made to provide Members<br/>with a lunch period of not less than thirty (30) consecutive minutes.</p>
<p>Prior to the revision of a &quot;rainy day&quot; schedule at any school site, input will be</p>

<p>ARTICLE 8-TRANSFERS</p>
<p>8.1. Introduction</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective and productive transfer is a professional responsibility of Members<br/>and a management duty of the District. To carry out this responsibility, teachers<br/>are expected to become familiar with the program and goals of the site to which<br/>they seek a transfer. A teacher who transfers to a new site should be prepared to<br/>carry out the duties of the position to which he/she has transferred, and should be<br/>aware that he/she will be evaluated his/her first year at the new site. The District<br/>will carry out its responsibility by posting openings, and after openings are posted,<br/>the District will conduct a “Transfer Fair” where information will be provided by site<br/>staff about each site. Members who are interested in transferring to a site should<br/>attend the Fair. Members may also use other means to become knowledgeable of<br/>the instructional program at the site in which the Member is interested.</p>
<p>8.1.1.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.1.1, so long as Education Code<br/>section 350356(a) continues to be in the Education Code, Members who<br/>are interested in transferring to any school site that is in API deciles 1-3 will<br/>attend the Transfer Fair, or if unable to do so, will arrange to meet with the<br/>Principal of the site to which they wish to transfer. If these provisions in<br/>Education Code section 35036(a) are removed from the Education Code,<br/>Section 8.1.1.1 will be removed from this Agreement.</p>
<p>8.2 Definitions</p>
<p>For sake of clarity, the following defined terms will be capitalized throughout Article 8.</p>
<p>8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer: A Transfer is defined as a change in a Member's assignment from one<br/>site to another site or a change in track at a site.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer: An Involuntary Transfer is defined as a transfer initiated by<br/>the District, which removes a Member from the Member’s existing site. An<br/>Involuntary Transfer will not be made in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8-TRANSFERS</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Voluntary Track Transfer: If a Member is reassigned to a different track at the<br/>same site without the Member volunteering to do so, this will be considered a<br/>“Non-Voluntary Track Transfer ” for the purposes of this Article, and the Member<br/>will have Non-Voluntary Track Transfer rights District-wide.</p>
<p>8.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Transfer: A voluntary transfer is defined as a Transfer initiated by the<br/>Member and approved by the District.</p>
<p>8.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment: A Reassignment is defined as a change in a Member’s teaching<br/>assignment from one grade to another grade at the same, or from one subject to<br/>another subject at the same site, but which does not change the Member’s track or<br/>school site.</p>
<p>8.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancy: A Vacancy is defined as an unfilled employment position to which no<br/>Member is assigned. Whenever there is a Vacancy at a school site the Principal<br/>may allow Members at that school site to fill those vacancies, as outlined in<br/>Paragraph 8.5.</p>
<p>8.2.6.1 For the purposes of defining a Member’s right to a Voluntary Transfer or<br/>Involuntary Transfer as described in this Article, a Vacancy only exists after<br/>school sites have completed all Non-Voluntary Track Transfers at the site,<br/>have internally posted openings at the site, and have allowed teachers<br/>already at the site to request an internal Voluntary Transfer to positions in<br/>different grades or on different tracks that are open at that site.</p>
<p>Involuntary T ransfers</p>
<p>8.3.1 A Member will be informed of an Involuntary Transfer as soon as possible after the<br/>needs of the District have been ascertained. A Member who is to be Involuntarily<br/>Transferred shall have the right to indicate preferences from the current list of<br/>vacancies. If more than one alternative is available, a Member’s preference will be<br/>given consideration. If two or more Members who are being involuntarily</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8 - TRANSFERS</p>
<p>transferred indicate a preference for the same position, the decision as to which<br/>Member shall receive the position shall be considered based on the needs of the<br/>District, required credentials, related assignment experience and District seniority.<br/>District seniority will be the deciding factor when all else is equal.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member who is Involuntarily Transferred after the first working day of the school<br/>year shall be provided with two (2) working days of release time for planning and<br/>preparation.</p>
<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Member is Involuntarily Transferred, he/she may have an informal hearing with<br/>the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources (“ASHR”) and the site<br/>principal/s involved. The Member may request Association representation at<br/>this/her request.</p>
<p>8.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Member who is Involuntarily Transferred shall have the right to request a<br/>transfer for the following year, and to have his/her preferences considered with the<br/>same priority as other involuntary transfers. However, the Member must request<br/>such a transfer and notify Human Resources in writing by March 15 of the school<br/>year prior to the requested start date of the proposed new assignment. If the<br/>Member is not transferred, the Member will have this same right each subsequent<br/>year until the member is transferred.</p>
<p>Non-Voluntarv T rack T ransfers</p>
<p>8.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member whose position on his/her existing track is eliminated shall have first<br/>consideration over all other Members for any open position on that same track at<br/>the Member’s existing site. This constitutes a reassignment.</p>
<p>8.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such a Member seeks to remain on the Member’s existing track and no position<br/>is open on that same track at the Member’s existing school, then the Member will<br/>have Non-Voluntary Track Transfer rights District-wide. If the Member seeks an</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8 - TRANSFERS</p>
<p>open position on another track at the same site, no priority consideration will be<br/>given</p>

<p>8.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member shall submit a request for a Voluntary Transfer directly to the ASHR.</p>
<p>8.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers shall be considered based on the needs of the District, required<br/>credentials, related assignment experience and District seniority. District seniority<br/>will be the deciding factor when all else is equal.</p>
<p>8.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member who is not selected to fill a vacant position may request a conference<br/>with his/her site administrator and/or ASHR to discuss future opportunities for<br/>lateral movement and/or career advancement.</p>
<p>8.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member shall be permitted to exchange assignments with another Member at<br/>the same site or other site within the District for one school year with site<br/>Administrator approval and authorization by the ASHR or designee. Both<br/>exchanging Members will agree in writing to return to their original sites and<br/>assignments at the end of the one-year period if possible. A Request must be<br/>submitted prior to May 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies</p>
<p>8.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Vacancy occurs after the last posting and is filled without being posted, the<br/>Vacancy will be considered to be filled temporarily and will be posted as a Vacancy<br/>for the next school year.</p>
<p>8.6.1.1 A Member who is placed in a position under the procedure in 8.6.1, and who is<br/>then displaced from the Member’s assignment as a result of the posting of the<br/>position as required in 8.6.1, has only Voluntary Transfer rights.</p>
<p>8.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of vacancies shall be posted by April 15. Additional vacancies shall be<br/>posted every three weeks, and will close by no later than June 10. Vacancies will<br/>be posted a minimum of five (5) days before the position is filled. A position that is</p>

<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>

<p>8.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member who is reassigned shall be provided with two (2) working days of<br/>substitute teacher assistance. This section will not apply to room changes for<br/>Members who are on year-round education unless these Members are reassigned<br/>after they have returned on-track.</p>

<p>8.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member who is moved to a different classroom after the first working day of the<br/>school year or after the first working day of each year-round session shall be given<br/>as much notice as possible before the room change occurs. The affected Member<br/>shall be provided with two (2) days of substitute teacher assistance. This section<br/>does not apply to a room change that occurs when a Member returns at the<br/>beginning of the school year, or the beginning of a new session.</p>
<p>8.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Assignments</p>
<p>8.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member on special assignment outside the classroom who transfers (either<br/>voluntarily or involuntarily) back to the classroom shall be treated according to<br/>Paragraphs 8.1 to 8.6.</p>
<p>8.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-time and Full-time Positions</p>
<p>8.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a half-time position is converted to a full-time position, the Member who<br/>currently holds the half-time position will be considered for a full-time position at<br/>that site, but will not receive preferential consideration for that increased position</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8-TRANSFERS</p>
<p>solely because he/she filled the half-time position. However, a position shall be<br/>maintained at the site for which the Member is credentialed.</p>
<p>8.10.2 The position held by the Member who serves as the complement to the<br/>Association president shall not be considered a half-time position for purposes of<br/>this Article.</p>
<p>8.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of Revised Tracks at a Site</p>
<p>8.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever revised tracks are initially implemented at an existing school site,<br/>Members at that site will be allowed to indicate their choice of schedule at their<br/>existing grade level or subject matter at their existing site. Assignment will be<br/>made on the basis of needs of the District, required credentials, and District<br/>seniority. District seniority will be the deciding factor when all else is equal. In<br/>such a situation, Members who are already at the site will have first consideration<br/>over transfers from other sites.</p>
<p>8.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Prohibitions on Transfers</p>
<p>8.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, a Member may not voluntarily<br/>transfer to a school offering K-8 classes that is ranked in deciles 1 to 3 on the<br/>Academic Performance Index if the Principal/Site administrator of the school<br/>refuses to accept the transfer. The District will not require or instruct any Principal<br/>to accept such a transfer. [See Education Code section 35036] fCA Codes<br/>(edc:35020-35046)] This provision is based on Education Code section 35036(a),<br/>and will be removed from the Agreement if these provisions in Education Code<br/>35036(a) are removed from the California Education Code.</p>
<p>8.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Agreement will assign, after April 15 of the school year prior to the<br/>school year in which the transfer would become effective, priority to a teacher who<br/>requests to be transferred to another school over other qualified internal or external<br/>applicants who have applied for positions requiring certification qualifications at the</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>school. [See Education Code section 35036} fCA Codes (edc:35020-35046)1 This<br/>provision is based on Education Code section 35036(b), and will be removed from<br/>the Agreement if these provisions in Education Code 35036(b) are removed from<br/>the California Education Code.</p>
<p>8.12.3 The requirements of State and federal law regarding teacher transfers will<br/>supersede any provisions of this Agreement that are contrary to law. Nothing in<br/>this Transfer article will be construed in a manner that is contrary to state or federal<br/>legal requirements and limitations on transfers, including but not limited to the<br/>California Education Code, the California Code of Regulations, and the federal No<br/>Child Left Behind Act. If the District becomes aware of statutes that require the<br/>District to act in a manner that is contrary to the terms of this Agreement regarding<br/>transfers, the District will meet and confer with the Association prior to<br/>implementing the statutory authority.</p>

<p>11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent in all cases shall be the District itself rather than any individual.<br/>The District may be represented by the appropriate administrator. The filing or<br/>pendency of a grievance shall not delay or interfere with the implementation of<br/>any District action during the processing thereof.</p>
<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; for the purposes of this Article, unless otherwise defined herein, shall<br/>be defined as a Member working day.</p>

<p>11.2.1.1 Within twenty (20) grievant working days after the occurrence of<br/>the act or omission giving rise to the grievance, or within twenty<br/>(20) grievant working days of when the grievant could reasonably<br/>have known of the act or omission, the grievant must advise the<br/>immediate administrator of the grievance and meet with the<br/>immediate administrator regarding the grievance, to attempt to<br/>informally resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>11.2.1.1 (a) For the purposes of this Article, immediate</p>

The Association shall have five (5) grievant<br/>working days from its receipt of the memorandum to review and<br/>accept or reject the proposed resolution as binding on the<br/>Association, or to agree that it will not be precedent setting.</p>
<p>11.2.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within two grievant working days from the end of each facilitated<br/>meeting that does not resolve the grievance, the parties can<br/>either:</p>
<p>(a) Mutually agree to hold another facilitated interest-based<br/>problem solving techniques meeting; or</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>11.2.3</p>
<p>(b) Either party may request in writing that the Step 2 process<br/>end, if either party feels the Step 2 process will not resolve<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>11.2.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three grievant working days from the end of each facilitated<br/>meeting that does not resolve the grievance, and if no additional<br/>facilitated meeting has been mutually agreed to by the parties, the<br/>facilitator will notify the ASHR on an agreed form that the informal<br/>grievance was not resolved.</p>
<p>11.2.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five grievant working days of the date the ASHR receives<br/>notice from the facilitator that the informal grievance was not<br/>resolved through the facilitated meeting process, the ASHR will<br/>give notice to the grievant, the Association, and the immediate<br/>administrator that the facilitated interest based problem solving<br/>meeting did not resolve the grievance. Said notice will terminate<br/>Step 2.</p>

<p>11.2.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mediation results in an agreement between the Parties that<br/>resolves the grievance, the agreement will be reduced to writing.<br/>The agreement shall not, however, be precedent setting unless<br/>the Parties mutually agree that it shall constitute precedent.</p>
<p>11.2.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mediation does not resolve the grievance, the<br/>mediator/advisory arbitrator shall be requested to render an<br/>advisory opinion.

The mediator shall be advised<br/>at the time of appointment of this aspect of the District/Association<br/>mediation process.</p>
<p>11.2.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mediator/advisory arbitrator shall communicate a decision to<br/>the Parties within twenty (20) calendar days after the conclusion<br/>of the mediation/advisory arbitration, and such a decision will<br/>terminate Step 4. This decision may be submitted by either Party<br/>at later steps in the grievance process, except that it may not be<br/>introduced as evidence or otherwise submitted in binding<br/>arbitration. [Other discussions during the mediation process,<br/>including but not limited to any offers of settlement or admissions,<br/>may not be used by either party in the subsequent<br/>grievance/binding arbitration process.]</p>

If the Board declines the request for review,<br/>that decision will constitute a termination of Step 5 and the<br/>decision of the Superintendent will become final immediately upon<br/>notice that the Board has declined review. If the Board grants<br/>review of the appeal, it shall schedule a closed session hearing<br/>(unless the grievant requests an open session) on the appeal as<br/>soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than fifteen (15)<br/>calendar days after its decision to accept review of the Step 5<br/>appeal.</p>
<p>11.2.6.3 If a majority of the Board votes to review the Step 5 decision, the<br/>Board may, at its discretion, request that evidence be presented<br/>in addition to the written documentation submitted by the grievant<br/>with his/her Step 5 appeal and the District’s written response to<br/>the Step 5 appeal. The additional evidence may take any form<br/>the Board shall direct. The Board shall have discretion to decide<br/>the amount of time to be granted to each side to present its<br/>evidence, but in no event will the grievant or Association be<br/>provided less than thirty (30) minutes to present its evidence to<br/>the Board. The Board may ask questions of the person giving the<br/>oral presentation. The thirty minutes shall not include time for<br/>answering questions or engaging in discussion with the Board<br/>during the presentation. Generally, the Board may control the<br/>manner, nature, and length of the presentation of the additional<br/>evidence. The Parties agree that formal procedures, such as</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>those required by the Administrative Procedure Act, are not<br/>required.</p>
<p>11.2.6.3 (a) After hearing the additional evidence, the Board<br/>shall meet in closed session to make a decision<br/>on the merits of the grievance. The Association<br/>and the grievant shall not be present during the<br/>Board’s closed session to decide the grievance.<br/>The Board may, in its discretion, meet in closed<br/>session immediately after the close of the<br/>presentation of evidence, or, as soon as is<br/>practicable thereafter, but in no event more than<br/>seven (7) calendar days after the close of the<br/>evidence.</p>
<p>11.2.6.4 The Board may also, at its discretion, determine the appeal based<br/>solely on the written documentation submitted by the grievant with<br/>his/her Step 5 appeal, and on the District’s written response to the<br/>Step 5 appeal. The Board shall review the written record and<br/>make a decision based on such record. If the Board proceeds<br/>based solely on the written record, the Board shall meet in closed<br/>session to make a decision on the merits of the grievance. The<br/>Association and the grievant shall not be present during the<br/>Board’s closed session to deliberate on and decide the grievance.<br/>However, the Board shall in such case allow the grievant and/or<br/>his/her representative not less than a thirty (30) minute period to<br/>make a statement to and provide information to the Board in<br/>closed session, prior to the Board’s commencement of its</p>

The thirty (30) minute period shall take place at<br/>the beginning of the regular Board meeting, or in a special Board<br/>meeting. The parties agree that the District may present<br/>information and evidence to the Board at the conclusion of the<br/>thirty (30) minute Association presentation, and that the<br/>Association and/or grievant do not have a right to be present<br/>during the District presentation.</p>
<p>11.2.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall render a written decision on the Step 6 appeal<br/>and notify all parties of such decision within thirty (30) calendar<br/>days of the Board’s receipt of the written Step 6 appeal, or within<br/>ten (10) calendar days of the Step 6 hearing, whichever period is<br/>longer.

<p>11.2.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only once in each arbitration, and prior to commencing the<br/>striking process, either party may elect to peremptorily discard an<br/>entire list of arbitrators provided by the AAA. The party, which<br/>elects to discard an entire list, shall pay in full for the cost of the<br/>replacement list from AAA.</p>
<p>11.2.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any questions arise as to the arbitrability of the grievance,<br/>including but not limited to questions regarding the timeliness of<br/>the grievance, such questions shall be ruled upon by the arbitrator<br/>prior to hearing the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>11.2.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the arbitrator has been selected, hearings shall commence<br/>at the convenience of the arbitrator, with the parties being<br/>afforded sufficient time to prepare for the arbitration. Hearings<br/>shall be confined to District working days. The arbitrator shall<br/>conduct the hearing in accordance with the voluntary arbitration<br/>rules of the American Arbitration Association and the provisions of<br/>this Article. The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set<br/>forth the arbitrator’s findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>on the issues submitted for arbitration. The arbitrator will not have<br/>any power or authority to make any decision which requires the<br/>commission of any act prohibited by law, or which is violative of<br/>the terms of this Agreement. However, it is agreed that the<br/>arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such financial<br/>reimbursement or other remedies as the arbitrator judges to be<br/>proper. The award of the arbitrator shall be submitted to both<br/>parties. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding<br/>upon the parties.</p>
<p>11.2.7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or<br/>modify the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitrator shall<br/>interpret this Agreement in accordance with accepted arbitral<br/>standards of contract interpretation.</p>
<p>11.2.7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall be provided all available documents relating to<br/>the grievance. Parties in interest shall be given at least ten (10)<br/>calendar days prior notice of scheduled hearings, unless the<br/>Arbitrator’s schedule reasonably requires lesser notice. Parties in<br/>interest and their representatives shall have the right to be<br/>present at such hearings.</p>
<p>11.2.7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to<br/>per diem expenses, the arbitrator’s travel and subsistence<br/>expense, and the cost of any hearing room, will be borne equally<br/>by the District and the Association. All other costs will be borne<br/>by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>11.2.7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any party requests a transcript of the proceedings, that party<br/>shall bear the full costs for creating said transcript. If the other</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>party then requests a copy of the transcript, that party shall pay to<br/>the original requesting party one-half (Vi) of the cost of the<br/>transcript, along with one half of the court reporter’s fee.</p>
<p>11.2.7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon mutual agreement of the District and Association, the<br/>arbitration may proceed under expedited rules of the American<br/>Arbitration Association. Notice of such mutual agreement shall<br/>accompany the request to AAA for a list of arbitrators.</p>
<p>11.2.7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a matter falls within the scope of this grievance article, and is<br/>therefore subject to binding arbitration, the grievant and the<br/>Association shall be barred from filing a legal action against the<br/>District regarding the subject matter of the grievance, except as<br/>otherwise provided by law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be<br/>final and binding on the parties to the grievance, except as<br/>otherwise required or allowed by law.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>11.3 Time Limits</p>
<p>If a grievance is not processed by the grievant in accordance with the time limits set<br/>forth in this Article, including paragraphs 11.4 and 11.5, it shall be considered settled on<br/>the basis of the decision last made by the District. If the District fails to respond to the<br/>grievance in a timely manner at any step, the running of the time limit shall be deemed a<br/>denial of the grievance at that step and a termination of that step, and the grievant may<br/>proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>11.3.1 For the purpose of calculating time limits under this Article, the first day (Day 1)<br/>of any time period shall be the first grievant working day after each event<br/>occurs, [e.g., If a grievable act occurs at 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December<br/>1 (a grievant working day), the first day for the purpose of calculating the 20-</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>day time limit to file a grievance would be Thursday, December 2 (if December<br/>2 is a grievant working day).]</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days indicated at each level should be considered as a maximum and<br/>every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time specified, however, may<br/>also be extended by mutual consent. In addition, the grievant or Association may<br/>request and shall receive an additional five days for the completion of any step in the<br/>grievance process. Such a request can be made after a timeline has run, but only once<br/>during each Step in the grievance process.</p>
<p>11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines as noted in this procedure may be adjusted at the request of either party, by<br/>mutual agreement. If either party requests a reasonable extension of a timeline prior to<br/>the expiration of the timeline, such request shall not be unreasonably refused by the<br/>other party. However, neither party is required to agree to multiple requests for<br/>extension of timelines by the other party.</p>
<p>11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the time that any deadline would run that would bar a grievance from<br/>proceeding, the District will provide a courtesy notice to the grievant and the Association<br/>that the deadline is pending.</p>
<p>11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter Representation</p>
<p>The grievant shall be entitled upon request to representation by the Association at all<br/>grievance meetings. In situations where the Association has not been requested to<br/>represent the grievant, the District will not agree to a final resolution of the grievance<br/>until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution<br/>of the grievance, and has been given a fifteen (15) calendar day opportunity to state its<br/>views on the grievance.</p>
<p>11.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality</p>
<p>In order to encourage a timely and fair review of a grievance, the Parties agree that it is<br/>the Parties’ mutual intent that from the time a grievance is filed until it is processed</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>through Step 6 of the grievance procedure provided herein, that the grievant, the<br/>Association, and the District shall not make public either the grievance or evidence<br/>regarding the grievance. The Parties further agree that the grievant, the Association,<br/>and the District shall not violate legal restrictions regarding the privacy and<br/>confidentiality of employee information at any time during the grievance process.<br/>Nothing in this provision shall prevent the Association or District from discussing the<br/>grievance within their respective governing bodies, or within the LMC, so long as<br/>confidentiality is otherwise maintained.</p>
<p>11.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance Files</p>
<p>The District's records dealing exclusively with the filing and processing of a grievance<br/>shall be maintained separately from the grievant's personnel file. All records used in the<br/>grievance process, which may have derived from personnel files maintained by the<br/>District will be returned to those files without indication that they had been used in the<br/>grievance process.</p>
<p>11.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Grievance</p>
<p>If SMEEA and the District mutually determine that the significant characteristics of a<br/>number of individual grievances are sufficiently alike such that it would be in the parties’<br/>best interests to consider this group of grievances as one grievance, they may mutually<br/>agree to do so. In such case, a group grievance would be initiated at Step 2 of this<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>11.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release Time</p>
<p>Grievance meetings will normally be scheduled so as not to conflict with pupil related<br/>duties. If this is not possible, reasonable release time will be provided to the grievant<br/>and one (1) representative to attend such grievance meetings as provided for in this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>11.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designees Allowed</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>In any case where this Article calls for the Superintendent, ASHR, Association<br/>President, or other person to perform any act under this Article, said person may<br/>designate a representative to act in his/her place.</p>
<p>11.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reprisals</p>
<p>No party shall take reprisals affecting the employment status of any unit member, party<br/>in interest, Association representative or other participant in the grievance process, by<br/>reason of such participation.</p>
<p>11.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms</p>
<p>Forms for filing grievances and other related documents will be developed jointly by the<br/>District and the Association and will be made available in the Human Resources<br/>Department at the District Office, at each school site, and at the Association office.</p>
<p>11.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discovery</p>
<p>The parties in interest agree to make available to each other, upon reasonable request<br/>therefore, and when practicable within 15 days of request, all non-privileged information<br/>relevant to the grievance.</p>
<p>11.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grievance meeting or hearing at any level of the grievance process is held<br/>during the work day, the grievant(s) and the Association representative shall be released<br/>for the duration of the meeting or hearing without loss of compensation. Any Member<br/>who is required to appear as a witness will be released from work only for that amount<br/>of time necessary to process the grievance or be a witness at a mediation or arbitration<br/>hearing, without loss of compensation. The grievant and Association representative will<br/>investigate and prepare for a grievance outside the instructional day, or while on</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>Association time.</p>

The Member<br/>and District will both contribute to the State Teachers' Retirement Fund the amount that<br/>would have been contributed if the Member were employed on a full-time basis.</p>
<p>12.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reduced Work Schedule Program will be authorized only in those instances<br/>where an assignment satisfactory to both the District and the Member can be<br/>established.

<p>ARTICLE 12 - RETIREMENT</p>
<p>Resources, the site Principal, and the temporary teacher who is finishing the instructional</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13-CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>Class size shall be at a level, which does not exceed state penalty class size standards<br/>and meets the educational standards of the District.</p>
<p>The District, in conjunction with the Association, will make a concerted effort to equalize<br/>class size and keep combinations at a minimum. A concerted effort would be made<br/>district-wide to keep class size in Grades K, 3-8 at 28:1 and 1 -2 at 20:1. A joint committee<br/>of representatives of the Association and the District Administration will meet during the<br/>first two weeks of the school year to consider ways and means to accomplish this<br/>objective. During the school year, if subsequent class size imbalances occur, either the<br/>Association or the District may call a meeting to consider ways and means to correct the<br/>difficulty. The Committee will also consider the subject of combination classes and will<br/>explore alternatives to reduce the number of such classes in the District and/or the number<br/>of students in such classes. (See Section 15.14)</p>
<p>School site committees will take District criteria which are the &quot;common considerations,&quot;<br/>and from that list will develop site criteria for faculty to approve by majority vote.</p>

<p>18.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a job share ends the Member who was originally at the site where the job share</p>
<p>began will retain the position, and the second job sharer will be placed as a voluntary<br/>transfer in accordance with Section Article 8 of this Agreement. However, if the second<br/>job sharer has been at the site for five or more years the job sharer will have on-site<br/>voluntary rights to available openings for which he/she is credentialed.</p>

<p>5</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>18.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a job share ends where both members were originally at that site and there is no<br/>vacancy at that site for which the Member with the least amount of District seniority is<br/>credentialed, he/she will be placed as a voluntary transfer.</p>
<p>18.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a job share must be terminated during the school year, the remaining job<br/>sharer must fill the position full-time, but only to the extent of the remaining job sharer’s<br/>approved work year (i.e., not to exceed 100%).</p>

<p>20.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year-round school work year shall be the same as described in Article 5, Section</p>
<p>5.1 of this Agreement. The calendar will be adjusted to provide a year-round school<br/>work year that reflects as closely as possible sixty (60) instructional days of on-<br/>schedule instruction and twenty (20) days of intersession. The calendar for tracks<br/>W, X, Y, Z shall be adjusted to reflect as closely as possible ninety (90) instructional<br/>days and thirty (30 days) of intersession</p>
<p>20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room Assignments</p>
<p>20.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will be responsible for reasonable and standardized moving, storing and<br/>security of Members' materials.</p>
<p>20.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever multiple schedules are initially implemented at a school site, Members will<br/>be allowed to indicate their choice of schedule at their existing grade level/subject.<br/>Assignment will be made on the basis of needs of the District, required credentials<br/>and District seniority. District seniority will be the deciding factor when all else is<br/>equal.</p>
<p>20.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Member does not receive his/her choice of schedule the Member will be granted,<br/>upon request, a conference with the site administrator and/or Assistant<br/>Superintendent for Human Resources to discuss the assignment. The Member shall<br/>be entitled to an Association representative upon request.</p>
<p>20.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District that Members shall have only one assigned room while<br/>on track except in situations where there are no other facilities on site.</p>
<p>20.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding 20.2.4 affected Members may develop an optional roving system for<br/>room assignment if submitted and approved by the site administrator before the<br/>school year begins, unless mutually agreed otherwise.</p>
<p>20.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families Within the School District</p>
<p>20.3.1 In the event that a Member is assigned to a year-round school and the Member=s</p>
<p>spouse is also a Member assigned to a year-round school, the District will make</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>ARTICLE 20 - YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL IMPLEMENTATION</p>
<p>every effort to have both Members assigned to the same schedule if this is<br/>requested.</p>
<p>20.3.2 If a Member has a child who attends school within the District, the District will make<br/>every effort to have the Member and his/her child (or children) on the same schedule<br/>if this is requested.</p>
<p>20.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange Days</p>
<p>20.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member teaching in an on-track assignment will be permitted to exchange a<br/>maximum of up to ten (10) consecutive instructional days in no more than two<br/>increments with another Member to teach the on-track Member's assignment, and<br/>who is at the time in intersession or on an off-track assignment. Members should<br/>seek to exchange with a Member who is credentialed to teach the on-track<br/>Member=s assignment. This section will also apply to Members who work on a<br/>traditional schedule.</p>
<p>20.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exchange arrangement will be agreed to between the two Members and signed<br/>by each. However, prior written approval must be obtained twenty (20) days prior to<br/>the exchange period and the request shall be submitted to the site administrator for<br/>consideration and recommendation, to be forwarded to the Assistant Superintendent<br/>for Human Resources for approval.</p>
<p>20.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a substitute shortage, an exception will be allowed to the<br/>requirements of 20.4.1 and 20.4.2 regarding the allowed number of days and<br/>increments, and the required notice. However the site administrators approval is<br/>required and excessive requests may be denied.</p>
<p>20.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change of Schedule</p>
<p>Members whose schedule is involuntarily changed from one schedule to another schedule</p>
<p>where there are less than twenty (20) school days remaining on their present session will be</p>

<p>ARTICLE 20 - YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL IMPLEMENTATION</p>
<p>given at least thirty (30) calendar days notice of a change of schedule and will not lose the<br/>right to take the intersession immediately following the end of the present session.</p>
<p>20.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing a four-track year round education (YRE) schedule at the junior highs, the<br/>exploratory subject teachers are placed on a rainbow schedule. Rainbowing these teachers<br/>may create an imbalance of student contact days causing teachers to teach one to two days<br/>more or less than the required student contact days (170 days) for four-track YRE schools.</p>
<p>20.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall attempt to provide a rainbow schedule that meets the<br/>contractual student contact work year. However, when the District cannot<br/>balance these rainbow teacher schedules, it is agreed that the teachers who are<br/>affected by the imbalance of their work schedule shall work with the school site<br/>principal to exchange days with one another to balance the student contact days<br/>and to bring them into alignment with the contractual work year. This alignment<br/>will be by mutual agreement with the approval of the principal.</p>
<p>20.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language in Paragraphs 20.7.1 to 20.7.6, below, was originally in Article 5. The<br/>language has been moved to this Article 20, with its former locations in Article 5 noted.</p>
<p>20.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of pupil contact days in the school year shall be 170 days for multi¬<br/>track YRE, with additional days for activities as prescribed by the District not to<br/>exceed seven (7) for Members on four-track YRE, and an additional day for<br/>Members new to the District. [Formerly in Article 5.1]</p>
<p>20.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In adopting the calendar each year, a concerted effort will be made so that<br/>Members' in and out days do not coincide. In the event that this is not possible,<br/>the room will be vacated by the Member going off track no later than 190 minutes<br/>after the start of the regular school day. The 190 minutes will consist of 180<br/>minutes instruction and ten minutes break. The lunch period for Members shall<br/>start at the end of 190 minutes. [Formerly in Article 5.1.3]</p>
<p>20.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In situations where the multi-track calendar has less than two Adot days® in a<br/>row, the dot day shall only be used for the purpose of allowing a Member who is</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>a classroom teacher to prepare that Member=s classroom for moving in or out,<br/>except classroom teachers may be required to attend a staff meeting on a dot<br/>day that does not exceed thirty minutes in length. [Formerly in Article 5.1.4]</p>
<p>20.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the work day for all Members who are on multi-track year round<br/>schedules, except part-time Members, shall be 6 hours and 40 minutes<br/>(exclusive of the lunch period). [Formerly in Article 5.2.1]</p>
<p>20.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time Members employed at a multi-track year round site shall have at least<br/>a three hour and twenty minute work day. [Formerly in Article 5.2.4]</p>
<p>20.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Members not assigned to a track must attend a mandatory staff development<br/>day on a day assigned by their supervisor. [Formerly in Article 5.12.5]</p>
