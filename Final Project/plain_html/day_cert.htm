<p>possible level.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance - A claim upon an event or condition which affects the obligations or<br/>circumstances under which a bargaining unit member works, allegedly caused by<br/>misinterpretation or inequitable application of that established policy which<br/>specifically affects a provision of this agreement or the terms of this contract.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant - An individual or group having a grievance.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day - A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the bargaining unit member is required to be in</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>attendance.</p>
<p>Section B. Representation</p>
<p>1. An employee may be represented at Steps 1, 2, or 3 of the grievance procedure by<br/>himself/herself, a representative of his/her choice, or, at his/her option by a<br/>representative selected by the union. After Step 3, the employee must have the<br/>concurrence of the union to proceed to Step 4.</p>
<p>2 If an employee is not represented by the union, the union shall have the right to be<br/>in an observer role unless otherwise requested by the employee.</p>
<p>3. The employee shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel if deemed</p>
<p>necessary at any step in the procedure provided the employee notifies the district at<br/>least two (2) days in advance that he/she will be represented by legal counsel.</p>
<p>Section C. General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at a level above the principal, the grievance shall be submitted in<br/>writing to the superintendent and the processing of such grievance shall be<br/>commenced at Step 2.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No decision or adjustment of a grievance shall be contrary to the provisions of this<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the administration to adhere to a decision deadline shall mean the<br/>grievance shall proceed to the next step. Failure of the employee or union to adhere<br/>to the submission deadline shall mean the employee is satisfied with the latest<br/>decision and waives any right to further appeal. Failure on the part of the employee,<br/>the employee’s representatives, and/or the union, to meet the time provisions so<br/>designated in this agreement, shall render the grievance null and void; however,<br/>nothing prohibits the parties from extending the dates by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the union to represent an<br/>employee in a conference with a management person, the representative shall be<br/>released without loss of pay for a reasonable length of time.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for release time shall be made to the superintendent at least one (1) day<br/>in advance. The representative shall have the right to visit the appropriate district<br/>sites to confer with the appropriate district employees covered by the provisions of<br/>this agreement during their duty-free time. Until final disposition of a grievance<br/>takes place, the grievant is required to conform to the original direction of his/her<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that more than twenty (20) grievances are under process at any one<br/>time and/or more than six (6) grievances are in process at any one step above the<br/>informal level, the union agrees to meet with management for the purpose of<br/>waiving time limits and they shall establish a reasonable time schedule for the<br/>orderly processing of such grievances.</p>
<p>Section D Procedure</p>
<p>1. First Submission - Informal - Employees</p>
<p>Any employee within the bargaining unit shall first discuss the grievance informally<br/>with the principal/designee, whether directly or accompanied by the union<br/>representative, with the object of solving the matter.

The meeting with the<br/>principal/designee shall take place within five (5) days of the employee's request for<br/>such a meeting.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Step 1 Formal Submission</p>
<p>If grievance is not settled to the satisfaction of the employee in informal process,<br/>the grievance shall be presented in writing to the principal/designee. The written<br/>grievance shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Names, dates and places necessary for a complete understanding of the<br/>grievance;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the provisions of the agreement which are alleged to have been<br/>violated or misapplied;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the reasons why the original resolution of the problem is<br/>unacceptable;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of specific sections requested which would remedy the grievance.<br/>Within five (5) days after the receipt of the written grievance, the principal shall<br/>communicate his/her decision in writing together with the supporting reasons.<br/>The principal shall furnish one (1) copy to the grievant and one (1) copy to the<br/>union.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2 Appeal to Superintendent</p>
<p>If the grievance is not resolved satisfactorily at Step 1, the grievant and/or the union<br/>may appeal within ten (10) days to the superintendent. The appeal shall be in<br/>writing and shall include a copy of the original appeal and the decision arrived at in<br/>Step 1.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) days after receipt of the appeal, the superintendent shall hold a<br/>meeting on the grievance upon request.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant, the grievant's representative, and/or the union shall be given at<br/>least two (2) days notice of the meeting.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) days after the meeting on the appeal, the superintendent shall<br/>communicate his/her decision in writing, together with the supporting reasons,<br/>to the grievant, the grievant's representative and/or the union.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3 Appeal to Board</p>
<p>If the grievance is not resolved satisfactorily at Step 2, the grievant may appeal<br/>within ten (10) days in writing to the Board of Trustees. If the appeal is received not<br/>later than 12:00 noon of the Tuesday preceding the date of a regularly scheduled<br/>meeting, the grievant and/or representative may present his/her case to the Board of<br/>Trustees in open and/or in closed session.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 4 Submission to Arbitration</p>
<p>If the grievance is not resolved satisfactorily at Step 3, the grievant, with the<br/>concurrence of the union, within ten (10) days after a decision by the Board of<br/>Trustees, may submit the grievance to advisory arbitration. If any question arises as<br/>to the arbitrability of the grievance, such question shall initially be ruled upon by<br/>the arbitrator and at the arbitrator's discretion such ruling may be reserved until the<br/>merits of the grievance have been heard.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration proceeding shall be conducted by an arbitrator to be selected by<br/>the two parties within ten (10) days after notice is given. If the two parties fail to<br/>reach agreement on an arbitrator within five (5) days, the State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Service will be requested to supply a list of five (5) names. Each<br/>party will alternately strike from the list until only one name remains. Further,<br/>each party shall have the right to reject an entire list.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall hold a hearing as soon as reasonably possible following<br/>his/her appointment. Five (5) days' notice will be given to all parties of the time<br/>and place of the hearing. Within ten (10) days after completion of the hearing,<br/>the arbitrator shall render the decision in writing and shall set forth his/her</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>findings of fact, reason, and conclusions on the issues submitted. If the<br/>arbitrator determines that additional time for his/her decision is necessary, the<br/>arbitrator shall have discretion to issue such decision within a reasonable period<br/>of time. The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any decision<br/>which requires the commission of any act prohibited by law or which violates<br/>the terms of this agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is<br/>empowered to include in any decision recommendations for reimbursement for<br/>financial loss of wages or fringe benefits or other non-financial remedies as<br/>judged to be proper. The arbitrator shall submit to all parties his/her findings<br/>and recommendations which shall be advisory in nature.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to empower the arbitrator to make<br/>any decisions amending, changing, subtracting from, or adding to the provisions<br/>of this agreement.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the employer and<br/>the exclusive representative. All other expenses shall be borne by the party<br/>incurring them and neither party shall be responsible for expenses of witnesses<br/>called by the other. If any grievance meeting or hearing shall be conducted<br/>during the school day, any employee required by either party to participate as<br/>witness or grievant in such meeting or hearing shall be released from regular<br/>duties without loss of pay for a reasonable amount of time. The superintendent<br/>and the union president shall mutually agree on the amount of release time and<br/>the number of witnesses to be released at any one time.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the arbitrator rules against the Board of Trustees and the Board does not<br/>comply with the ruling, the district will pay all costs of the arbitration.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may request an individual to make a written record of the entire<br/>arbitration hearing. The cost of the services and expenses of such individual<br/>shall be paid by the requesting party or shared by the parties if they both<br/>mutually agree.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed<br/>separately from the personnel file of the participants as designated in this<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>6. Step 5 Board Action</p>
<p>Upon consideration of the arbitrator's advice, the Board shall take action on the<br/>grievance and shall render its final decision by no later than the next regularly<br/>scheduled Board meeting providing the arbitrator's ruling is received in time to be<br/>on the Board's agenda and providing that copies of the arbitrator's decision have<br/>been given to the Board members in sufficient time to permit the Board members to<br/>review the decision. In the event that copies of the arbitrator's decision have not<br/>been provided to the Board members at least three (3) days in advance of the<br/>regularly scheduled Board meeting, the Board may delay taking action on the<br/>grievance until the second regularly scheduled Board meeting following the<br/>arbitrator's decision.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII TRANSFER PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. Voluntary Transfer Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary transfer is a request by a teacher resulting in the movement of that<br/>teacher from one school to another.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall apply in writing to the superintendent requesting a voluntary<br/>transfer. Said request shall be dated and filed according to the date and time<br/>received in the district office. Additions will be made to the Voluntary Transfer<br/>List and assigned a priority number by seniority on the list. This list shall be</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>updated regularly as requests occur and shall be posted semi-annually. The<br/>transfer request shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Position(s) requested.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School site requested.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials, major/minor and teaching/work experience.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date of hire and length of service of applicant.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district will post the position vacancies of unassigned classes for the first<br/>semester by May 15. These lists will be updated periodically as vacancies occur.<br/>Teachers responding to this list of expected vacancies, or who are interested in<br/>transferring to another school, will submit their written requests to the<br/>superintendent beginning May 15th or January 5th in the second semester.

<p>B. Involuntary Transfer Procedure</p>
<p>An involuntary transfer is one requested by the administration without the teacher's<br/>approval which results in the movement of that teacher from one school site to another.</p>
<p>1. Involuntary transfers can only be invoked for the two following reasons:<br/>a. In a school where the need for a staff reduction has been demonstrated.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such transfer shall occur except when the voluntary transfer procedure<br/>has been exhausted.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers in the affected school shall be notified in writing by the<br/>employer describing such a need. Said notification shall include<br/>description of vacancies in other schools. Teachers in the affected school<br/>may volunteer to transfer and shall be given priority in filling such<br/>vacancies.</p>
<p>In cases where more than the necessary number volunteer, seniority shall<br/>prevail except as specified in the Voluntary Transfer Procedure.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the voluntary transfer procedure has been exhausted and none of the<br/>teachers in the affected school who are eligible respond affirmatively and<br/>an involuntary transfer is necessary, the district shall consider the following<br/>criteria:</p>
<p>a. Major and minor fields of a teacher's preparation, teaching and/or work</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstrated need for staff reduction within a school or department due<br/>to enrollment change of 32 students or more.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inverse seniority in the district.</p>
<p>(4) Written notice of each involuntary transfer shall be given to each teacher<br/>being transferred five (5) working days after the voluntary transfer<br/>procedures have been exhausted,<br/>b. In a school where there is a demonstrated need for a change in the educational<br/>environment.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such transfer shall occur unless:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timely evaluations (a minimum of two) are on record which have<br/>delineated the specific conditions supporting the demonstrated need for a<br/>change in educational environment, and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A program for remediation based on the issues raised in the teacher's<br/>evaluation has been offered, implemented and documented by the<br/>administration that shortcomings still exist.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations which document substantial improvement based on the issues<br/>raised in the evaluations may not be used in demonstrating need for change<br/>in educational environment.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of all documentation, including evaluations and the remedial process<br/>shall be forwarded to the teacher and the union.</p>
<p>C. Voluntary Teacher Exchange</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary teacher exchange is a temporary exchange of assignment by two<br/>teachers assigned to different work sites.</p>

<p>assignment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exchange may be for any length of time up to one year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for implementation of exchange shall be:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers involved write a proposal to be submitted to both principals at<br/>least two weeks before the beginning of the proposed exchange.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal shall include the name, location, assignment and certification of<br/>each teacher as well as the inclusive dates of the exchange.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals shall respond within five (5) school days. Both principals must agree<br/>for the exchange to occur.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both teachers wish an extension (not to extend past the end of the current school<br/>year) verbal agreement by teachers and principals involved shall be sufficient.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent, voluntary exchange of assignments may be implemented upon<br/>application by both teachers to the principals and approved by both principals.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII POSITIONAL CHANGES WITHIN THE UNIT</p>
<p>Section A Definition of Positional Change</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A positional change shall include those positions paying a salary differential and/or<br/>positions which are appointed to coordinate or supervise programs or provide a<br/>service that is not classroom teaching.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such positions which are not elected (e.g. department heads and ESEA<br/>Coordinator) shall include: psychologists, counselors, librarians, work experience<br/>coordinator, attendance teacher, and any extra-curricular appointment.

<p>A school with site based management may elect to devise another selection<br/>procedure to fill positions as described in Section B. This procedure must be<br/>submitted to the Superintendent and the AFT Executive Board for approval and<br/>site-specific negotiations.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX STAFFING</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employer will make every effort to continue to employ teachers according to the<br/>provisions of the State Education Code.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event decreasing enrollment necessitates lay-off, the district shall abide by the<br/>State Education Code except where teachers have the same hiring date. In these<br/>cases lay-off shall be by inverse seniority. All such procedures shall be consistent<br/>with the provisions of the contract.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall make an effort to actively recruit qualified applicants in fields<br/>where there are few candidates prior to actual openings. When openings are known,<br/>the district will begin recruitment immediately from the first date of the known<br/>vacancy.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to keep staffing levels constant throughout the school year, the district shall<br/>budget the cost of maintaining the typical loss in sections at mid-year ($85,000).</p>
<p>ARTICLE X TEACHING HOURS AND ASSIGNED DUTIES</p>
<p>Section A Traditional Schools</p>
<p>1. Teachers shall be in their classrooms before the start of the school's first passing</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>period of regular instruction and shall remain at school until the end of the last<br/>teaching period. Summer school teachers shall be in their classrooms at the<br/>beginning of the class period and shall remain at least until the end of the class<br/>period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall have one (1) preparation period per day. Preparation periods shall<br/>be utilized in a professional manner. The day school time schedule will contain the<br/>minutes needed to meet the instructional minutes requirement of 64,800<br/>instructional minutes in the school year. In order to reasonably guard against short<br/>falls in instructional minutes (due to inclement weather, etc.), each school shall<br/>schedule a minimum of 65,160 minutes (64,800 + 360) in the school year.</p>
<p>Pursuant to ABX4 2 approved July 28, 2009, the Union and the District agree to<br/>reduce the work year by the equivalent of 4 days of instruction with the<br/>corresponding reduction of instructional minutes. The Union and the District agree<br/>to negotiate the potential of reinstatement of these days when this legislation<br/>sunsets following the 2012-13 school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable efforts will be made to provide minimal alterations of pupil contact<br/>time or preparation periods which may occur for registration, testing or staff<br/>workshops.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site and/or district administration shall notify staff of schedule changes with<br/>significant advance notice to allow for a smooth functioning of the educational<br/>system. While maximum advance notice is desirable, a week's notice is a reasonable<br/>time frame for prior notification. Such notice shall be in writing. On those occasions<br/>when less than five (5) working days is given, all efforts shall be made to place<br/>reasons for lack of notice in writing to provide minimal disruption of classroom<br/>planning.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment to additional classroom teaching duties shall be on a voluntary basis<br/>during the assigned preparation periods and the teacher shall be paid in accordance<br/>with Article XIX Section B.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members will not be required to substitute for their absent<br/>colleagues nor proctor exams during their prep period. Volunteer teachers shall be<br/>paid the established hourly rate (See Section B - Substitute Wage Schedule - Article<br/>XIX).</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the teacher's regular assignment, teachers shall be required to fulfill<br/>up to the following number of duties beyond the school day:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Supervision Committees will meet during the 2002-03 school year to<br/>address the issues regarding Co/Extra-curricular Supervision Assignments. This<br/>site work will be followed by a district-wide Supervision Committee that may<br/>recommend new rules to assure that extra duty assignments are made fairly and<br/>in a manner that assures relative parity in their administration among sites. If the<br/>District-Wide Supervision Committee is unable to finish its work by May 16,<br/>2003, any new rules adopted governing the assigning of duties will take effect in<br/>assignments for 2004-05. Any new rules regarding the administration of</p>
<p>Supervision assignments adopted before the start of school in 2003-04 will take<br/>effect in 2003-04.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to assign a maximum of two (2) extra duty<br/>assignments per year. In no case shall a teacher be assigned to more than<br/>three (3).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open house and/or back to school night, not to exceed one (1) per year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preschool orientation meeting for all teachers, one (1) per year.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School checkout meeting, one (1) per year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of assignments shall be made on an equitable basis for all unit<br/>members within each school. Hourly employees shall be exempted.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers shall be entitled to a duty free, uninterrupted lunch period of not less<br/>than thirty (30) minutes.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>10. On the second Friday in May, techers of 12th grade students must notify the</p>
<p>Principal if any 12th grade student will &quot;likely&quot; fail the course. If the failure of this<br/>course will result in a student not graduating with their class, the student will be<br/>placed in the &quot;senior studies&quot; summer school course.</p>
<p>Section B. Schools With Site-Based Management</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated staff, through use of site-based management, may vary the length<br/>of their teaching blocks and frequency of their preparation periods as needed to<br/>accomodate their restructured schedule with the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule meets the required number of instructional minutes, unless a<br/>waiver is obtained from the State Department of Education.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching assignments and preparation periods are equitable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication period may or may not be a part of the schedule agreed to by<br/>the certificated staff.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through site-based management the staff may decide the number of duties and how<br/>those duties are fulfilled as long as all staff members are treated equitably.</p>
<p>Section C. Teaching Year/Work Year Traditional Schools</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teaching days shall be 180 plus two staff work days, pending<br/>continued funding to support the staff work days. Pursuant to ABX4 2 approved<br/>July 28, 2009, the Union and the District agree to reduce the work year by the<br/>equivalent of 4 days of instruction with the corresponding reduction of instructional<br/>minutes. The Union and the District agree to negotiate the potential of<br/>reinstatement of these days when this legislation sunsets following the 2012-13<br/>school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support service teachers shall work the same number of days as other unit<br/>members. Additional days shall be paid on a pro-rata basis, pending continued<br/>funding to support the staff work days.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychologists shall work 195 days. Pursuant to ABX4 2 approved July 28, 2009,<br/>the Union and the District agree to reduce the work year by the equivalent of 4 days<br/>of instruction with the corresponding reduction of instructional minutes. The Union<br/>and the District agree to negotiate the potential of reinstatement of these days when<br/>this legislation sunsets following the 2012-13 school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honoraria for volunteer summer workshops are excluded.</p>
<p>Section D. Teaching Year/Work Year For Schools With Site-Based Management</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the work year and negotiated calendar may be altered through the<br/>site-based management process. A plan must be submitted by the Academic<br/>Council to the superintendent and the AFT Executive Board for approval and site-<br/>specific language.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since responsibility for support services may be spread out among the certificated<br/>staff, the work year required for these services to be provided may be decided by<br/>the Academic Council. Additional pay for these services may be decided through<br/>site-based manangement if within the budget responsibilties accepted by the school.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XI TEACHER ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Section A. Day School Teacher Assignments For Traditional Schools</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day school teachers shall be given notice of the status of their following year<br/>class schedule, subject assignments, building and room assignments not later than<br/>the last day of the Spring term. If, following this notification, circumstances dictate<br/>additional changes to the master schedule, the teacher(s) involved shall be notified<br/>immediately with copies to the union.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All newly-hired teachers shall be given notice of departmental assignment and a<br/>tentative class schedule at the time of employment. Final notification shall be in<br/>accordance with the procedures set forth above.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to assure that students are taught by teachers working within their areas of<br/>competence, teacher assignments shall be based upon their certification,<br/>major/minor fields of study, prior teaching and/or work experience and<br/>demonstrated teaching skills.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort shall be made to assign teachers to a schedule of classes that requires<br/>no more than three preparations, an equitable assignment of classes by levels of<br/>ability, and no more than one room change per day. Site administration will consult<br/>with the union's building representative to resolve exceptions to this assignment<br/>effort.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who teach a class with split levels (e.g. Spanish I, II and III) shall not be<br/>assigned more than one class with split levels and shall not be given more than three</p>
<p>(3) preps.</p>
<p>Section B. Day School Teacher Assignments For Schools With Site-Based Management</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of the master schedule, subject assignments, building and room<br/>assignments, shall involve the certificated staff through site-based manangement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly-hired teachers who cannot be involved in the creation of the master<br/>schedule shall be given a tentative schedule at the time of employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher assignments shall be based upon credential and major/minor fields of<br/>study. To accomodate the nature of a restructured school, and assuming the<br/>appropriate waivers can be obtained from the California State Department of<br/>Education, assignments may be based on other criteria. However, no teacher will be<br/>assigned to a subject area for which he/she is not appropriately credentialed without<br/>his/her permission.</p>
<p>Section C Summer School Assignments</p>
<p>16</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher assignments in activity classes: i.e., science, industrial arts, fine arts,<br/>homemaking, librarian, and special education will be offered first to host school<br/>personnel.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a teacher/counselor has taught summer school two of the previous four years,<br/>that teacher's name will be put at the bottom of the list for summer school<br/>assignment. In order to assure that students are taught by teachers working within<br/>their areas of competence, teacher assignments shall be based upon their<br/>certification, major/minor fields of study, prior teaching and/or work experience<br/>and demonstrated teaching skils. If there is more than one equally eligible<br/>candidate, the candidate with the highest seniority in the district will have<br/>preference except for activity classes as described above.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a teacher/counselor is paid by unrestricted general funds for summer<br/>work, that person shall be selected under the summer school hiring process.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII MAXIMUM/MINIMUM CLASS SIZE LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>Section A Traditional Schools</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that class size limitations for the regular high schools shall be<br/>computed on the basis of the actual number of students enrolled in each classroom.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thirteen (13) teaching days in the Fall and ten (10) in the Spring, teachers<br/>shall have a total daily student contact number not to exceed 170 students. This<br/>shall be pro-rated for part-time teachers.</p>
<p>a. Teacher daily student contact maximums may be exceeded if the site<br/>administrator and the teacher agree in writing detailing the specific needs<br/>warranting such exceptions.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No class shall have more than 34 students, except as noted in 4 below.</p>
<p>a. Individual class size maximums may be exceeded if the site administrator, the<br/>teacher, and the department head agree in writing detailing the specific needs<br/>warranting such exceptions.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size in laboratory or other activity classes involving learning stations or<br/>special equipment shall not exceed the number of stations in the room as defined</p>
<p>below:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homemaking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Arts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science Labs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Education&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Arts (art, photography, crafts, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algebra A and B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced Placement Classes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32</p>
<p>1. Individual class size maximums in physical education may be exceeded if<br/>the site administrator, the teacher and the department head agree in writing<br/>detailing the specific needs warranting such exceptions.</p>
<p>5. Support service personnel include counselors, librarians, psychologists, attendance<br/>supervisors, technology curriculum coordinators, systems coordinators, site</p>
<p>technology coordinators. Standards Implementation Project Coordinators, grant<br/>writers and work experience coordinators. The maximum load for support service<br/>personnel shall be determined by the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each traditional high school site, the maximum load for each full time<br/>counselor shall be 550 (110 per section). Beginning with the Spring semester of<br/>2006-07, AB 1802 funding will allow the maximum load for each full-time<br/>counselor to be at 400 (80 per section) in order to provide the required services<br/>to students who have failed the CAHSEE, as well as those students who are at<br/>risk of not graduating due to insufficient credits. When final funding figures<br/>become available in early 2007, the district and the union will work to further<br/>reduce the ratio. The continuance of this lower counseling load is contingent on<br/>maintaining the same funding level contained in AB 1802 from the State of<br/>California.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each traditional high school site, the maximum student contact responsibility<br/>for each attendance supervisor shall be based on the following:</p>
<p>One (1) period at a projected enrollment of 400 students.</p>
<p>Two (2) periods at a projected enrollment of 600 students.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a permanent teacher is evaluated by the site administrator, using materials that<br/>reflect the California Standards for the Teaching Profession, and is found to &quot;Need<br/>Improvement&quot; in one or more of the standards, the teacher may choose to participate<br/>as a Volunteer Participating Teacher and be assigned a Consulting Teacher. The<br/>&quot;Needs Improvement&quot; category is the first and only step to be taken at the beginning<br/>of the evaluation process if the evaluator deems the teacher’s work to be below<br/>standard. At this point, the principal will offer the teacher the option of choosing to<br/>voluntarily participate in the PAR program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participating teacher will choose from a list of available Consulting Teachers and<br/>may address the PAR Council to request a change in Consulting Teacher, giving<br/>reasons for such request. The PAR Council will make every effort to accommodate<br/>these requests from the available Consulting Teachers at that time.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation will remain with the principal while the teacher works with the<br/>Consulting Teacher and develops a plan. The Consulting Teacher will discuss this<br/>plan with the principal.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the school year, the principal will conduct the second part of the<br/>evaluation cycle. If improvement has been demonstrated and the evaluation is</p>
<p>&quot;Satisfactory&quot; or above in all of the Standards, the evaluation cycle will be complete.<br/>The principal will be available to the PAR Council to answer questions about the<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the teacher still &quot;Needs Improvement&quot; or receives an &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; in any of the<br/>California Teaching Standards, he or she will be referred to the PAR program for the<br/>next school year. &quot;Needs Improvement&quot; evaluations require a referral to the PAR<br/>program as &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot;. In all cases, all evaluations will become part of the<br/>teacher's personnel file.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the next school year, the referred participating teacher and the<br/>Consulting Teacher will construct an improvement plan and begin working together.<br/>The participating teacher may request a change in Consulting Teachers in writing<br/>with specific reasons for the request, and the PAR Councl will make every effort to<br/>accommodate such requests.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of the improvement plan, but before the end of the school year, the<br/>Consulting Teacher will provide the PAR Council with a summary which will<br/>enumerate the nature and the results of the work done to improve the teacher’s<br/>performance, as well as all conferences and professional workshops attended, and<br/>observations made. The Consulting Teacher will discuss this report with the<br/>participating teacher five days prior to submission to the PAR Council. In addition,<br/>the principal will be notified by the Consulting Teacher that the improvement plan is<br/>complete, and the principal will conduct a third evaluation in the standards on which<br/>work was done. The principal will discuss this evaluation with the participating<br/>teacher at least five days before the Par Council meets to consider it. Both Consulting<br/>Teacher and principal will be available to the PAR Council to answer questions about<br/>these materials.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permanent teacher has the right to attend the PAR Council meeting at which the<br/>summative report is presented and to address the PAR Council. The permanent<br/>teacher has the right to representation by the union at this meeting. At the conclusion<br/>of this discussion, the PAR Council meeting to discuss possible personnel action<br/>which could result in termination of employment is attended only by the Council and<br/>the Superintendent.. The PAR Council must consider the information provided by the<br/>Consulting Teacher and the principal in determining its recommendation.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Council will determine if the teacher should continue working with a<br/>Consulting Teacher, is released from the program due to a &quot;Satisfactory&quot; or above in<br/>the areas in which the teacher has been working, or should be referred to the school<br/>board for personnel action as provided by the provisions of the PAR program. A<br/>second consecutive &quot;Needs Improvement&quot; requires continued participation in the<br/>PAR program.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a non-permanent teacher receives a &quot;Needs Improvement&quot; in any of the teaching<br/>standards, the principal will notify the BTSA Support Provider or another appropriate<br/>provider and request special assistance in the area of need. If resources are available,<br/>additional PAR Consulting Teacher assistance may be provided. The principal will<br/>complete the final evaluation within the school year that the original evaluation took<br/>place. The teacher has the right to attach a statement to the evaluation. It will be<br/>reviewed by the PAR Council to determine if timelines and procedures were<br/>followed and appropriate assistance offered.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All decisions to refer teachers for intervention through this program shall not be<br/>subject to the grievance procedure. The contents of reports and decisions made as a<br/>result of those reports are not subject to the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall modify or in any manner affect the rights of the<br/>District/Goveming Board under provisions of the Education Code relating to<br/>employment, classification, retention or non-reelection of certificated employees.<br/>Nothing herein shall modify or affect the District’s rights to issue notices of<br/>unsatisfactory performance (and/or unprofessional conduct) pursuant to Education</p>
<p>Section E. General Provisions For Evaluation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary purpose of evaluation of unit members is to promote a more effective<br/>instructional program in a continuing process. The primary purpose of the written<br/>evaluation procedure of unit members is to improve classroom instruction and<br/>services in support of classroom instruction. The evaluation of certificated<br/>personnel is a continuing process.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated personnel with permanent status in the district shall be evaluated in<br/>writing every other year for their performance on two of the six California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) and item #7 listed on the<br/>Summary Evaluation Form (Ancillary Duties and Responsibilities). Evaluation<br/>summaries shall be completed no later than May 15. Pursuant to Chapter 566,<br/>amending California Education code 44500 and 44664, highly qualified teachers<br/>who have served the district for 10 or more years and whose previous evaluation<br/>rated the teacher as meeting or exceeding standards shall be evaluated every four</p>
<p>(4) years. Principals reserve the right to notify teachers of an interim evaluation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-permanent personnel shall be evaluated in writing annually for their<br/>performance on each of the California Standards for the Teaching Profession<br/>(CSTP) and Ancillary Duties per item #7 on the Summary Evaluation Form. Initial<br/>conferences shall be held no later than November 15 with the written evaluation<br/>summaries completed within 30 days of the initial classroom observation, but no<br/>later than May 1.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation shall be conducted by the principal to whom the individual teacher<br/>is directly responsible. Although the evaluation may be delegated to another<br/>administrator, the principal is ultimately responsible for all evaluations.</p>
<p>Section F. Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time a pre-observation conference is scheduled, the evaluating administrator<br/>and teacher (in the case of permanent employees) will decide which two of the six<br/>standards (CSTP) will be evaluated. Each evaluation cycle should focus on two<br/>standards that were not seen in the prior evaluation; however, either the teacher or<br/>the administrator may request that one standard from a prior evaluation be repeated.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-observation conference shall be held between the evaluator and teacher to<br/>review the evaluation process and Initial Conference Form prepared by the teacher.<br/>The teacher and evaluator will agree on which class will be both observed and<br/>examined. In addition to a classroom observation, the evaluator will examine the<br/>following data: course syllabus and outcomes, a year long plan for instruction and<br/>assessment, a detailed unit plan including assessment tools, and a broad sampling<br/>of student work reflecting the prescribed outcomes. Other classes may be observed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A concluding conference shall be held to review the evaluation and shall include a<br/>written summary, with appropriate commendations and recommendations,<br/>placement on the agreed upon rubric, and a discussion of next steps for professional<br/>development.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evaluation shall be done within the context of the instructional program(s) but<br/>will also include the performance of non-instructional responsibilities, such as<br/>supervisory and advisory duties (Item #7 on the Summary Evaluation Form).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observed behavior, which is to be cited by the evaluator in the evaluation and that<br/>was not seen during a formal observation must have been brought to the attention of<br/>the teacher within five (5) working days of its occurrence.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher has the right to make a written response to any evaluative material.<br/>This response shall be attached to and filed with the original document.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>If the evaluation leads to a referral to Peer Assistance and Review (PAR), the rules<br/>governing PAR will apply.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVII RETIREMENT</p>
<p>Section A. Retirement Benefits</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees must enroll in Medicare A and B when they qualify for Medicare. After<br/>ten (10) years of continuous, full-time service, or for those hired in 08-09 and<br/>thereafter with fifteen (15) years of continuous, full-time service in the Jefferson<br/>Union High School District, an employee may retire any time after the</p>
<p>end of the school year in which the employee reaches the age of fifty-five (55), or at<br/>the age of fifty (50) to fifty-five (55) with thirty (30) years STRS credit, and will<br/>continue to receive district-paid health benefits for self and eligible dependents for a<br/>period of ten (10) years, up to age seventy-five (75), if he/she enrolls in Parts A and<br/>B of Medicare by their 65th birthday and enrolls in the health carrier's Medicare<br/>plan. The retiree's spouse/registered domestic partner must also enroll in Parts A<br/>and B of Medicare by their 65th birthday and enroll in their health insurance<br/>carrier's Medicare plan to maintain district-paid health benefits for the ten (10) year<br/>period, or until the retiree's benefits end. It is the retiree's responsibility to notify<br/>the District Office prior to Medicare eligibility to guarantee this additional benefit<br/>beyond age 65. Dental benefits will be paid for retiree and eligible dependents for<br/>a period of seven (7) years up to age seventy (70), whichever occurs first. All new<br/>employees hired by the district after the ratification of the 2009/10 contract, once<br/>retired, will pay into their benefits at the same rate as active employees.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASH IN LIEU - Retirees who have medical coverage provided and paid for by<br/>the employer of the retiree's spouse or registered domestic partner equivalent to that<br/>offered by the district AND provide evidence of such a plan will receive $2,500 in</p>
<p>one annual stipend at the end of the school year. In no case shall the cash in lieu<br/>exceed that of any active employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RE-IMBURSEMENT - Reimbursement of the cost of medical benefits shall be<br/>provided for those retirees who move out of all district carrier HMO service areas<br/>currently covered by the district's health plans. In no case shall the benefit for any<br/>retiree exceed the dollar amount paid for the highest costing coverage of any retiree<br/>residing within the district's HMO service area. The district will reimburse the<br/>retiree on a quarterly basis for the actual cost of replacement insurance upon<br/>verification of actual expenses.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FLEXNET - Beginning October 1, 2003, the District will no longer support the<br/>medical benefits provided by Flexnet. Current retirees and those considering<br/>retirement under this section should plan for coverage under #1, #2 or #3 of this<br/>section.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees shall have the right to continue to enroll in the applicable plans subject to<br/>the above commitment provided this is at the retiree's own expense and is consistent<br/>with carrier requirements. Retirees who elect to continue enrollment in a group plan<br/>(or plans) shall submit premium payments to the district quarterly and shall submit<br/>such payments by the twenty-fifth (25th) day of the month prior to the quarter for<br/>which payment is due.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiring certificated employees and their spouses or registered domestic partners<br/>may enroll in health or dental benefits due to AB 528 legislation within 30 days of<br/>losing active employee coverage. If retired employees, spouses or registered<br/>domestic partners do not enroll in the health or dental care plans during this initial<br/>enrollment period, or drop coverage after their initial enrollment, the district is not<br/>obligated to offer another opportunity to enroll. However, if retired members or<br/>their spouses or domestic partners lose other coverage and can provide<br/>documentation of that loss, they shall be allowed to enroll in the health or dental<br/>plan if they do so within 31 days of losing their coverage.</p>
<p>Certificated employees, who become disabled and receive disability benefits from<br/>CalSTRS, are eligible to enroll if the disability is a result of injuries that are a direct<br/>consequence of a violent act. The enrollee is responsible to pay the entire cost of<br/>the premium.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits for Surviving Spouse - Article XIX, Section G.</p>
<p>Section B. Early Retirement</p>

<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of injury to or illness of the employee during the leave, the sabbatical<br/>leave will be terminated and all provisions for sick leave will apply. If injury,<br/>illness or death prevents the employee from fulfilling the leave agreement to<br/>return to service in the district, no repayment of leave salary will be required.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and conditions of the leave shall be agreed upon in writing, and shall<br/>include but not be limited to the following:</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both parents of a child who are entitled to family care leave are employees of<br/>the district, the district shall not be required to grant leave in connection with<br/>the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child that would allow the parents family<br/>care leave totaling more than twelve (12) weeks collectively.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXVI PROVISIONS FOR RESTRUCTURING</p>
<p>Section A. Process For Planning And Implementing Site-Based Management and<br/>Restructuring</p>
<p>To restructure, a school must have site-based management. To have site-based<br/>management, a school must have an approved school site plan and an Academic<br/>Council.</p>
<p>1. Establishing An Academic Council</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated staff must be the first group to demonstrate a<br/>willingness to participate in restructuring and/or site-based management.<br/>Such willingness will de demonstrated by an affirmation of 2/3 of the<br/>certificated staff to authorize the development of a school site plan and<br/>for the election of an Academic Council. The vote will specify whether<br/>the school proceeds directly to the establishment of an Academic<br/>Council or develops a school site plan first.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the school proceeds directly to the election of an Academic Council,<br/>the newly elected Academic Council's first task would be as an interim<br/>planning committee to develop the school site plan. If the vote is to<br/>develop a school site plan first, a planning committee will develop the<br/>school site plan for restructuring/site-based management. The Academic<br/>Council would be elected after the approval of the school site plan.<br/>Parents, students and other staff may also be involved in the planning.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school site plan must detail the duties, responsibilities, authority and<br/>make up of the Academic Council. The Academic Council may be<br/>given virtually any power given to the school site administration and<br/>department heads in the contract. In addition, there is specific language<br/>throughout the contract that details other duties, responsibilities and<br/>authority the Academic Council may be given. The school site plan may<br/>give the Academic Council all or only some of these powers.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academic Council may have a certain time of the school day or<br/>week assigned to Academic Council functions. Any such plan must be<br/>part of the school site plan. Resources to pay for this time may come<br/>from these sources:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reallocation of department head periods</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A diversified staffing plan</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reallocation of school budget funds</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring of the school day or week</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding through other monies available from grants and other<br/>possible state funds.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academic Council</p>
<p>An Academic Council may, within the scope of the contract:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve as an interim committee to develop the school site plan.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan staff development activities to further the education of the staff on<br/>restructuring.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage and allocate school budget funds as a part of the school site<br/>plan.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set and revise school policies and practices according to the school site<br/>plan.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve as an on-going site-based management team to deal with major<br/>policies and practices relating to the instructional program including<br/>budget, curriculum, master schedule and facilities.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluate and assign teachers and staff according to the school site plan.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommend the hiring of teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Process For Implementation</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Academic Council to be fully implemented and given authority<br/>to act, the school site plan must be approved by an affirmative vote of<br/>2/3 of the certificated staff in the school and the concurrence of the<br/>principal.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approval by the staff, school site plans must be submitted to the<br/>AFT Executive Board for review and approval, and to the<br/>Superintendent and Board of Trustees for final approval.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic Council Selection Process</p>
<p>Once a faculty has authorized the election of an Academic Council, the</p>
<p>following selection process will be used:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a minimum of five (5) council members and a maximum<br/>of seven (7). The council shall be comprised of the principal, one (1)<br/>elected BISS representative, and three (3) to five (5) other<br/>representatives elected by the certificated staff. The staff is encouraged<br/>to add a parent and a student for which representation may be extended<br/>to nine (9) members.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will request nominations from certificated staff by giving<br/>each certificated person a written request for nominations on a time-line<br/>that corresponds to the school plan. Nominations will be taken from the<br/>BISS unit members on a separate request for nominations.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated staff and BISS will submit written nominations (only with<br/>the consent of the nominee) to the principal.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will prepare a ballot including the names of all nominees.<br/>Each certificated person will have the opportunity to vote for the total<br/>number of elected certificated members that will comprise the council.<br/>BISS employees will vote for one BISS representative.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated candidates will prepare a written statement of<br/>philosophy or purpose with respect to serving on this council. These<br/>statements will be distributed to each certificated person prior to a<br/>specially-called faculty meeting during which a question and answer<br/>session with each candidate will be provided. There will be a secret<br/>ballot election following this meeting.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BISS members will hold a question and answer session and may prepare<br/>a written statement indicating their interest and experience. BISS<br/>members will turn in their ballots to the principal. The BISS candidate</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>receiving the largest number of votes will be elected.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal, the AFT building representative, and one department head<br/>(chosen by the department heads) shall tally the ballots. The department<br/>head chosen to participate in the tallying of the ballots shall not be a<br/>candidate.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Academic Council shall be announced in writing to all<br/>staff.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of office shall be for three (3) full academic years and any part<br/>of the election year in which council members would take office as per<br/>the school site plan. If staffing or sections are affected, the plan should<br/>begin at the beginning of a semester with sufficient lead time for</p>
<p>construction of master schedules. In the event a member vacates his/her<br/>seat on the council, an election shall be held to fill the seat within three</p>
<p>(3) weeks of notification that the seat will be vacated. As of 2005/2006<br/>Oceana waives the provision calling for three-year terms and<br/>implements two-year terms until the Academic Council notifies the<br/>Union and the District that three-year terms can be restored.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A council member may be recalled by a faculty (if certificated member)<br/>or BISS employees (if BISS member) at any time. The recall occurs if<br/>the faculty or BISS employees submit a petition for recall to the<br/>principal signed by 50% + 1 of the total unit of employees in that school.</p>
<p>Process To Be Used In Site-Based Management By The Academic Council</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of site-based management is to empower the staff to make<br/>the decisions affecting their overall functioning as an educational<br/>delivery system.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academic Council members are elected representatives and must<br/>approach problem-solving by setting up a process that involves the<br/>participation of all of the immediate or primary stakeholders whom the<br/>decision will affect, (e.g. In a decision or problem involving a conflict<br/>among divisions, departments or houses, a meeting of representatives<br/>not on the Academic Council from those houses might be called and<br/>facilitated by members of the Academic Council to assist these<br/>individuals in discussing and arriving at a decision or solving a problem<br/>among themselves.)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the Academic Council in decision-making is to avoid a<br/>unilateral top-down style of management; to facilitate the active<br/>involvement of all concerned parties in the decision-making; to find<br/>creative ways of dealing with managing the school environment in order<br/>to avoid conflict and tension among the staff; and to help all<br/>stakeholders feel a valuable part of the whole.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions shall be made by consensus as defined here:</p>
<p>CONSENSUS: A systematic process used by a group to make decisions<br/>which everyone can support. A consensus decision has been reached<br/>when:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All group members agree to support the decision though it may not<br/>be everyone's first choice;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is committed to the decision as if it were the first choice of<br/>all group members;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each participant agrees that he or she had had an equal opportunity<br/>to influence the decision; and</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one raises an objection when the group leader calls for consensus<br/>approval of a decision.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If decisions cannot be reached by consensus, the council may choose to</p>
<p>delegate the decision to a committee of at least three (3) consisting of the<br/>principal and two (2) elected representatives.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal must concur with the decisions; if he/she does not concur,<br/>the rationale for disagreement will be put in writing and given to the<br/>Acedemic Council.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academic Councils are required to meet regularly, but not less than<br/>once a month.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academic Council meetings shall be scheduled at the convenience<br/>of the participants.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Academic Council shall select a chairperson responsible for setting<br/>the agenda; facilitating the meeting or providing a facilitator if needed<br/>for any particular meeting; ensuring that the consensus process is<br/>followed; and ensuring that the decision-making process involves all<br/>stakeholders.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Academic Council shall select a recorder responsible for taking<br/>minutes of each meeting; distributing the minutes in a timely fashion to<br/>all staff members; maintaining a file at the school of Academic Council<br/>records.</p>
<p>6. Disbanding The Academic Council</p>
<p>An Academic Council will be disbanded at a time proposed by a petition<br/>requesting same which is signed by 2/3 of the certificated staff and is<br/>submitted to the principal. The Board of Trustees or the AFT Executive<br/>Board may call for the disbanding of the Academic Council if this would be<br/>in the best interests of the district or the union. At that time, the school<br/>structure in place immediately before the existence of the Academic Council<br/>will be reinstated unless another plan is submitted and approved.</p>
