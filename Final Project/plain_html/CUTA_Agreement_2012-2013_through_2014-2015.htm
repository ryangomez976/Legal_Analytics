<p>The District’s personal illness and injury leave entitlement shall not exceed one (1)<br/>day for each eighteen (18) contract days, up to a maximum of ten (10) days per<br/>year. The full entitlement shall be available for use beginning on the bargaining unit<br/>member’s second day of service on the current contract. In a case where a unit<br/>member fails to work a full contract year, the number of sick leave days granted<br/>shall be based upon the eighteen (18) contract days accrual.</p>
<p>Commencing with the 2005-2006 school year, employees who are assigned to and<br/>work a 7/6 schedule on an ongoing basis (not less than a semester) will get paid for<br/>sick leave based on the pay rate of the 7/6 schedule. If the employee returns to a<br/>6/6 schedule, the employee will get paid for sick leave based on the pay rate of the<br/>6/6 schedule for all accrued sick leave days. The same approach shall be applied<br/>to a 6/5 schedule.</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^Verification of Illness</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members may be required to secure verification of illness or injury<br/>from a health practitioner licensed by the State when using personal illness and<br/>injury leave for more than two (2) consecutive days. When more than ten percent<br/>(10%) of the bargaining unit members at a school site are absent due to personal<br/>illness or injury on any day or number of days, those bargaining unit members using<br/>personal illness and injury leave shall, upon request by the District, be required to<br/>secure verification of each day’s illness or injury from a health practitioner licensed<br/>by the State. The extent and nature of the request and verification may vary<br/>according to the needs as determined by the District.</p>
<p>4.1.3Accumulated Sick Leave</p>
<p>The District shall provide a bargaining unit member upon written request, with a<br/>written statement of (a) his accumulated sick leave total, and (b) his sick leave<br/>entitlement for the school year. Such statements shall be provided within thirty (30)<br/>days after the written request is made.</p>
<p>4.1.4 Notification Requirements</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall contact the District not less than ninety (90) minutes<br/>prior to the beginning of the school day on the first day of leave and shall notify the<br/>building principal/site administrator no later than 1:30 p.m. of their intent to return</p>
<p>the next day, unless the next day is a holiday or weekend. Failure to so notify the<br/>building principal/site administrator may result in continuation of the substitute<br/>teacher’s services in which case the cost of the individual’s substitute pay shall be<br/>deducted from the unit member’s monthly salary.</p>
<p>4.1.5 Use of Accumulated Sick Leave for Family Illness</p>
<p>Unit members may use up to six (6) accumulated or available sick leave days to<br/>care for an ill child, parent or spouse as provided for by Section 233 of the California<br/>Labor Code. This is in addition to use of accumulated leave provided in Section<br/>4.5.</p>
<p>4.2 Extended Sick Leave</p>
<p>4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entitlement</p>
<p>Any bargaining unit member, after using her/his accumulated paid sick leave and<br/>who is still unable to work due to illness or injury, shall be entitled to extended sick<br/>leave subject to verification every three weeks from a health practitioner licensed by<br/>the State. Extended sick leave shall begin after all accumulated paid sick leave has<br/>been used and shall continue up to a period of up to five (5) months, or the number<br/>of days necessary for the leave to last until the end of the school year in which the<br/>leave began. The five (5) month period or number of days provided herein shall be<br/>counted during the teacher workyear.</p>
<p>4.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be provided more than one five-month period per illness<br/>or accident, except as provided in Section 4.2.1 above (i.e., to complete a leave<br/>to the end of the school year in which the leave began). However, if a school<br/>year terminates before a five-month extended leave is exhausted, the employee<br/>may take the balance of the five-month period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>4.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee has exhausted all available sick leave, including<br/>accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent on account of illness or<br/>accident for a period beyond the period provided pursuant to Section 4.2.1, and<br/>the employee is not medically able to resume the duties of his or her position,<br/>the employee shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a<br/>reemployment list for a period of 24 months if the employee is on probationary<br/>status, or for a period of 39 months if the employee is on permanent status.<br/>When the employee is medically able, during the 24- or 39-month period, the<br/>certificated employee shall be returned to employment in a position for which he<br/>or she is credentialed and qualified. The 24-month or 39-month period shall<br/>commence at the expiration of the period provided pursuant to Section 4.2.1.</p>
<p>4.2.2Pay While on Extended Sick Leave</p>
<p>During the period of extended sick leave, the bargaining unit member shall receive<br/>partial pay equal to the difference between his/her regular pay and the amount paid</p>
<p>4.2</p>
<p>the substitute teacher. If no substitute is employed, the bargaining unit member<br/>shall receive partial pay equal to the difference between his/her regular pay and the<br/>amount derived by multiplying the short-term daily substitute rate by the number of<br/>working days absent.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity and Parental Leave</p>
<p>4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Requirements for Maternity Leave</p>
<p>A bargaining unit member shall be entitled to use personal illness leave including<br/>extended sick leave as provided in sections 4.1.1 and 4.2.1 of this article for<br/>temporary disability due to pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion and recovery<br/>therefrom. Disability means that the bargaining unit member is medically unable to<br/>perform her regular duties. The length of the leave of absence, including the date<br/>on which the leave commences and the date on which the bargaining unit member<br/>shall resume duties, shall be determined by the unit member and her physician.<br/>Such leave shall not be used for child care.</p>
<p>4.3.2Verification</p>
<p>The unit member shall submit the verification from her doctor upon the District’s<br/>form, “Physician’s Medical Verification Letter (Pregnancy Only),” obtainable from the<br/>Personnel Department.</p>

<p>A leave of absence without pay shall be granted for the purpose of raising her/his<br/>natural or adopted child. Such leave shall be for no more than twelve (12) months’<br/>duration. The District and the unit member shall schedule the period of leave in<br/>order that the return date shall coincide with normal school breaks, i.e., the<br/>beginning of a semester. An extension of the leave for up to an additional twelve</p>
<p>(12) months may be granted upon request. Such extension shall not be denied in<br/>an arbitrary or capricious manner and reasons for denial shall be given to the<br/>bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Leave</p>
<p>4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>Personal leave without pay, up to one school year, may be granted a bargaining<br/>unit member upon written request. Such leaves shall not be denied in an arbitrary</p>
<p>4.3</p>
<p>or capricious manner and reasons for denial shall be given to the bargaining unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>4.4.2Continued Rights</p>
<p>Personal leave is not to be regarded as a resignation. Such a bargaining unit<br/>member shall return to the next position on the salary schedule and such absence<br/>shall not result in forfeiture of tenure nor loss of time accrued toward tenure prior to<br/>the leave.</p>
<p>4.4.3Benefits While on Leave</p>

<p>The criteria applied by the Sabbatical Committee in making its recommendations<br/>for sabbatical leave shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential benefit the sabbatical leave experience may have to the<br/>bargaining unit member’s professional growth.</p>

Health and welfare<br/>benefits will be maintained during the bargaining unit member’s leave.</p>
<p>4.12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation of Leave</p>

No restitution of any sabbatical leave<br/>salary paid up to the first day of sick leave shall be required, provided the<br/>proper notification to the Superintendent was made. If death prevents the<br/>bargaining unit member from fulfilling the terms and conditions on which the<br/>leave was granted, no repayment of salary will be required from the bargaining<br/>unit member’s estate.</p>

<p>The parties acknowledge that, due to the vagaries of the annual student<br/>teacher calendar (i.e., holidays, minimum days and inservice days), there may<br/>be occasions in which unit members do not receive exactly an additional ninety<br/>(90) minutes of preparation every week.</p>

<p>EMPLOYEE/MANAGEMENT POSITIVE WORKING<br/>RELATIONSHIP'S TEAM (EMPWR TEAM)</p>
<p>This team of employees and district management will work together as equals to</p>
<p>resolve issues and improve communication within the district.</p>
<p>23.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Composition of EMPWR</p>
<p>23.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be established a Team which shall meet as determined by the<br/>Team, but in no event less than once per month.</p>
<p>23.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CUTA shall be represented by four members.</p>

<p>Problems that cannot be solved in this manner will be referred elsewhere.</p>
<p>23.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subjects brought to the EMPWR Team shall be of district-wide (as opposed to<br/>a single site) concern, or concerns of a site which, despite good faith attempts<br/>by all parties involved, have not been resolved at the site level. It is not the<br/>intent of the parties to bypass communications between the teachers and site<br/>administrator; the parties agree that discussion of site level concerns should<br/>occur at the site.</p>
<p>23.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMPWR Team is neither intended to supersede the Grievance Procedure<br/>provided in this Agreement nor to affect the right of a unit member or the<br/>Association to utilize that procedure.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 25<br/>DISCIPLINARY ACTION</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary action is defined as an oral warning or reprimand, written warning, written<br/>reprimand, suspension, demotion or dismissal. Suspension without pay shall be<br/>limited to a maximum of fifteen (15) days. Disciplinary action must be substantiated<br/>and shall be for just cause. Written warnings shall not be placed in the official<br/>personnel file unless attached or referred to in a subsequent written reprimand for the<br/>same or similar conduct.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board and the Association agree that discussions with teachers regarding<br/>disciplinary action shall be conducted in an appropriately private setting apart from<br/>individuals not directly involved in the issue. This shall not constitute a waiver of<br/>representation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall have the right to be accompanied by an Association representative at<br/>any meeting with the administrator where disciplinary action is contemplated or<br/>discussed.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, the action taken by the District shall be invoked at a level commensurate<br/>with the offence.</p>

<p>♦ SIDELETTER</p>
<p>SIDELETTER A<br/>MEDICARE COVERAGE</p>
<p>November 9, 1992</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree to provide an election (hereafter “Division”)<br/>so that current employees who were eligible for coverage under the State<br/>Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) as of March 31, 1986 and who have not<br/>otherwise been mandated into Medicare coverage, may elect whether or not they<br/>wish to have contributions made by them and on their behalf for purposes of<br/>establishing eligibility for Medicare coverage.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as practicable, the Board shall pass an appropriate resolution indicating<br/>its intent to offer “Medicare only” coverage for eligible employees pursuant to<br/>appropriate procedures for conducting a Division; and, agreement or amendment<br/>to agreement with the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) allowing for<br/>the provision of “Medicare only” coverage for eligible employees who have elected<br/>such coverage.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties understand that the election is on a one-time-only basis.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employees electing “Medicare only” coverage, the District will contribute an<br/>amount equal to 1.45% of monthly or tenthly wages until such time as the<br/>employee’s annual salary for that year has been paid or has reached the statutory<br/>maximum, whichever occurs first. A matching 1.45% of wages shall be deducted<br/>from the employee’s salary for purposes of contributing to eligibility for “Medicare<br/>only” coverage.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall begin with November 1993. By so doing, the parties intend to<br/>provide four quarters’ coverage for that calendar year in light of their current<br/>understanding that contributions based upon $2,080 of covered earnings will<br/>provide four quarters toward eligibility in any one calendar year. Neither the<br/>Association or the District assumes any liability or responsibility in the event that<br/>fewer than four quarters are generated as a result of beginning contributions<br/>effective November 1993.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize that final state and federal approval of the necessary<br/>agreements may be as far away as a year to eighteen months following ratification<br/>of this provision. Accordingly, the parties agree, if necessary, to escrow the<br/>deductions and contributions described in paragraph 4 above until contributions to<br/>be forwarded directly to the Social Security applied toward the District’s obligation<br/>to pay and reimburse PERS for the administrative costs which may periodically be<br/>billed to the District. After such interest is exhausted the District will assume sole<br/>responsibility for payment of such costs.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are relying on the coverage quarters provide pursuant to this<br/>provision and who retire prior to the date of final approval by the federal</p>
<p>government, do so at their own risk. Neither the District nor the Association<br/>assumes any liability or responsibility for any information or calculations pertaining<br/>to number of quarters or any other related information upon which employees may<br/>have relied in deciding whether or not to elect “Medicare only” coverage.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of this provision is to provide eligible employees with an<br/>opportunity to elect whether or not they wish to have contributions made for them<br/>or on their behalf for the purposes of eligibility for Medicare coverage. This clause<br/>is not intended nor shall it be applied as a guarantee that such employees will, in<br/>fact, upon retirement be eligible for “Medicare only” coverage. Questions arising<br/>as to the application and/or interpretation of this clause shall be specifically<br/>excluded from the grievance/arbitration clause of this collectively negotiated<br/>agreement.</p>

<p>MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>STATEMENT OF BELIEFS AND PRINCIPLES</p>
<p>The Governing Board of the Cabrillo Unified School District and the Cabrillo Unified</p>
<p>Teachers' Association, CTA/NEA, agree to the following statement of beliefs and</p>
<p>principles:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District can no longer look to the State of California as a realistic source of<br/>revenues in sufficient amount to meet the educational, employment-related, and<br/>facilities needs of the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the lack of financial support from the state, the District must look within (to<br/>continue to ensure every existing dollar is spent wisely), and to the local<br/>community for innovative ways to generate additional revenues to enable the<br/>District to meet its current and future needs.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the most crucial needs of the District are lowering class sizes and<br/>providing all teachers, including fourth and fifth grade teachers, a comparable<br/>amount of meaningful preparation time. Advances in these two areas directly<br/>benefit students in the classroom by enabling teachers to prepare adequately<br/>and to offer quality instruction to a reasonable number of students.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governing Board, CUTA, and the teachers it represents are committed to<br/>explore the feasibility of any and all means by which District revenues may be<br/>enhanced in order to achieve improvements in teacher preparation time, class<br/>size, facilities, and other areas of District need. To those ends, the parties<br/>commit to work together for the enactment of any revenue raising methods which<br/>are adjudged to be feasible, fair and reasonable.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>BUDGET STUDY WORKSHOPS</p>
<p>As a result of negotiations leading to the 1994-97 Agreement, the parties agree that<br/>two (2) representatives selected by CUTA shall be entitled to sit with the Governing<br/>Board and participate in discussions when the Board meets for budget study<br/>workshops. At least one of CUTA's representatives shall be a member of CUTA's then<br/>current negotiating team.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF<br/>FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADE PREPARATION TIME</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (“Mou”) is to clarify the intent<br/>of the parties regarding establishment of fourth and fifth (4/5) grade preparation<br/>time and the educational program in support thereof.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1996-97 negotiations, the parties acknowledged a mutual interest and<br/>need to rectify the disparity in the amount of preparation time provided to District<br/>4/5 grade teachers as compared to their colleagues. The parties agreed that any<br/>solution must provide more preparation for 4/5 grade teachers and enhance<br/>educational opportunities for students.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the parties that the 4/5 prep program provide a long-term<br/>solution to the concerns of the District and the Association regarding 4/5<br/>preparation time.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the mutual interest of the parties to work collaboratively to ensure the<br/>success of educational programs in support of the 4/5 preparation time, including<br/>the design and implementation of such programs.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that enhancement programs in support of the 4/5 preparation<br/>time should complement and supplement programs already being provided by<br/>4/5 teachers.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN<br/>CABRILLO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND<br/>CABRILLO UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION<br/>RE: IMPLEMENTATION OF EVALUATION PROCESS BASED ON<br/>CALIFORNIA STANDARDS FOR THE TEACHING PROFESSION</p>
<p>The Cabrillo Unified School District and the Cabrillo Unified Teachers Association agree to the<br/>following process in order to revise Article 9 (Evaluation) and Appendices H, I, J and K (“forms”)<br/>of their negotiated Agreement in order to incorporate the six (6) California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Professions (CSTP) as the basis for the evaluation of unit members in the District.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to establish a joint negotiations subcommittee (“Evaluation<br/>Committee” or “E.C.”) whose mission shall be to produce a recommended revised Article<br/>9 and set of forms to align these provisions with the CSTP.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E.C. shall develop recommended procedures, time lines, a dissemination/implementation plan, and<br/>forms necessary to implement a CSTP-based evaluation system.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E.C shall be comprised of an equal number of CUTA and CUSD representatives,<br/>provided that the members of the PAR Panel shall also be members of the E.C. The</p>
<p>E. C. shall meet according to a schedule established by the E. C., provided that there<br/>shall be an equitable division of meeting times between the regular workday and non¬<br/>work hours.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E.C. shall attempt to reach consensus on the product referred to in paragraph 1<br/>above; the E. C. shall indicate areas on which consensus has not been reached, if any,<br/>in their final recommendation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E. C.’s final recommendation shall be submitted to the parties’ negotiations teams in<br/>sufficient time to allow for implementation of the pilot program at the commencement of<br/>the 2003-2004 school year. The negotiations teams shall agree upon the parameter of<br/>the pilot evaluation program prior to such implementation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the pilot evaluation program, e.g. timing, by site and/or individual,<br/>applying to all new teachers, etc., shall be subject to the negotiated agreement as<br/>provided in paragraph 5 above.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E.C.’s recommendation and the negotiated pilot agreement shall include a<br/>component for analysis and evaluation of the pilot program. Such date shall be<br/>presented to the negotiations teams no later than May 1, 2004. Thereafter, the<br/>negotiations teams shall make whatever changes are mutually agreed upon in order to<br/>arrive at a final, negotiated CSTP-based evaluation procedure.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After bilateral ratification, the revised evaluation procedure shall be fully implemented<br/>District-wide effective with the 2004-2005 school year.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The E.C. may request that changes or amendments may be made to this MOU, which<br/>requests shall be subject to the agreement of the District and CUTA. In addition, the<br/>District and CUTA retain complete authority to revise or revoke this MOU by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN<br/>CABRILLO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND<br/>CABRILLO UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>COLLABORATION TIME</p>
<p>September 26,2008</p>
<p>The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU) is to set forth the agreement<br/>between the Cabrillo Unified School District (“District” or “CUSD”) and the Cabrillo<br/>Unified Teachers Association (“Association” or “CUTA”) regarding the process by<br/>which individual school sites may establish “collaboration time.” The District and<br/>Association agree that the provisions of this MOU shall be incorporated into the<br/>negotiated Agreement upon completion of the 2008-2009 negotiations process.</p>
<p>The parties mutually acknowledge that the impetus for establishing collaboration time<br/>includes complying with legal mandates such as those for schools in Program<br/>Improvement (“PI”) status to implement “Improvement Plans” and schools undergoing<br/>WASC accreditation review. Improvement Plans and WASC recommendations may<br/>include a recommendation calling for collaboration time. In addition, schools not in PI<br/>status or undergoing WASC review may wish to establish or increase such time/activity.<br/>The parties agree that the process set forth in this MOU shall be utilized to modify daily<br/>schedules for the purpose of establishing or modifying collaboration time. In any event,<br/>the parties agree their mutual interest underlying this MOU is for the District to meet all<br/>legal mandates.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p>1. Half Moon Bay High School: The parties recognize the need for HMB High<br/>School to implement collaboration time effective with the beginning of the<br/>2008-2009 school year. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective with the fall 2008 semester what has been referred to<br/>informally as “preparation time” (not the formal preparation times set<br/>forth in section 13.3 of the negotiated Agreement) shall hereafter be<br/>referred to as “undesignated time.”</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such undesignated time occurs four (4) or five (5) times per month and<br/>shall be utilized as follows:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> times: Collaboration activities as have already<br/>been established.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> times: Undesignated time.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5<sup>th</sup> time (if this occurs): Staff meeting which shall be in<br/>lieu of other staff meetings for that month.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fall 2008 semester, the administration and faculty shall<br/>follow the process set forth in section 3 below pursuant to a time line</p>
<p>that will enable implementation of a collaboration time plan (“Plan”)<br/>effective with the beginning of the second (2009) semester.</p>
<p>d. During the second (2009) semester, the administration and faculty<br/>shall follow the process set forth in section 3 below for adoption of a<br/>Plan to be implemented effective with the beginning of the 2009-2010<br/>school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hatch and Cunha:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration and faculty at Hatch and Cunha shall follow the<br/>voting process set forth in section 3 below, to be completed by<br/>October 21, 2008, to determine whether a plan shall be implemented<br/>effective with the beginning of the 2008-2009 third trimester (Hatch),<br/>and either the second semester or fourth quarter (Cunha). If a plan is<br/>implemented pursuant to this section, it shall continue in effect<br/>through the 2009-2010 school year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Plan is not implemented during the 2008-2009 school year, the<br/>administration and faculty at each site shall follow the process set forth<br/>in section 3 below for adoption of a Plan to be implemented effective<br/>with the beginning of the 2009-2010 school year</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular Process for Adopting and Implementing Collaboration Time Plan:<br/>Except as set forth above, the regular process to be used by a site to determine<br/>whether and how to establish or continue a Plan shall be as follows (not<br/>applicable to Kings Mountain).</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of Proposed Plan: Anyone at the site - e g., teacher(s),<br/>administrator(s) etc. - may initiate and develop a proposed Plan which<br/>may or may not be in response to the legal mandates set forth in this<br/>MOU.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site Leadership Team, CUT A site representative(s) and<br/>site administration shall participate in the development of the<br/>Plan. The site Leadership Team selection process shall be<br/>consistent with the principles set forth in the training guide on<br/>leadership teams (Goldhammer).</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the three foregoing groups reach consensus on the proposed<br/>Plan, the CUSD/CUTA review process set forth in section 3 (b)<br/>below shall occur. If consensus is not reached, the matter shall<br/>be referred to the Superintendent and CUTA President for<br/>resolution. Upon resolution, the process set forth in section 3</p>
<p>(b) shall occur. If there is no resolution, the process is<br/>concluded.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a school is in PI status and the Improvement Plan requires<br/>collaboration time, a proposed Plan, whether for the first time<br/>or as part of a renewal, shall not contain an option of no<br/>collaboration time.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeline and Approval Process: The “regular” timeline and approval<br/>process for establishing/renewing/modifying/discontinuing a Plan is as<br/>follows (as distinguished from the original implementation provisions</p>
<p>at several sites per sections 1 and 2 above). The parties agree these<br/>timelines are “goals” which the parties will endeavor to accomplish.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 1: The site has evaluated the Plan for the current<br/>school year and has developed a proposed Plan for the<br/>following school year.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 1 - 15: The proposed Plan is reviewed by CUSD and</p>
<p>CUTA for technical or contract issues (i.e., if a contract<br/>“waiver” is required).</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 15: If there are technical issues, or a contract waiver<br/>is required, CUSD or CUTA can refer the Plan back to the site<br/>with recommendations, or the parties can agree to grant<br/>necessary waivers.</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By April 15: If the proposed Plan is not referred back to the<br/>site and/or a waiver is granted, the school site decision by vote<br/>(see below) shall be completed.</p>
<p>v. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the proposed Plan is referred back to the site and/or a waiver<br/>is not granted, CUSD and CUTA shall agree on a timeline for<br/>completion of the process.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Decision-Making Process: Upon preliminary approval by CUSD<br/>and CUTA as set forth in section 3(b) above, approval and<br/>implementation of the Plan shall be subject to the following process:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a secret ballot vote to approve or reject the<br/>proposed Plan.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote shall be held over several days.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principal and CUTA site representatives shall jointly<br/>conduct the election over several days and shall jointly count<br/>ballots.</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for a Plan to be implemented, at least 60% of those<br/>voting must vote to approve the Plan.</p>
<p>v. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the 60% requirement is met, the Plan shall be implemented<br/>the following school year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disapproval of Proposed Plan for Subsequent School Year: If a site<br/>disapproves the proposed Plan, the site will return to the daily schedule<br/>that was in effect at the beginning of the 2008-2009 school year.</p>
<p>4. The provisions of this MOU shall be subject to Article 11 (Grievance<br/>Procedure) of the negotiated Agreement.</p>

<p>Tom Cox, President</p>
<p>Rob Gaskill, Superintendent</p><h5>LEADERSHIP TEAM:<br/>SELECTION PROCESS</h5>
<p>The most widely agreed process is to have school wide representation.</p>
<p>If you are a small elementary school (15-25 staff members), a Leadership Team of 5 to 7<br/>people will suffice. This would not include the principal or a classified staff member. If<br/>the school has an assistant principal, he/she should NOT be on the team. You are looking<br/>for a majority of teachers. A middle school or high school Leadership Team should not<br/>be greater than 10 members initially.</p>
<p>NOTE: there is a strong possibility that not all grade levels or subject matters will be<br/>represented. This will need to be clearly communicated to the staff and agreed on.</p>
<p>One possible scenario is to have grade level clusters meet and decide on a representative:</p>
<p>Ex. Elementary: K-l-2-3 one from each grade; and 4-5 one to represent both<br/>grade levels;</p>
<p>Middle-school/High school: a combination of grade levels and academic<br/>focus (6<sup>th</sup> grade: reading and math reps; 7<sup>th</sup> grade: history and science<br/>reps; 8<sup>th</sup> grade: language arts and algebra reps; and one elective teacher;<br/>one Special Ed or ELL teacher). You get the idea.</p>
<p>This is not a clean-cut process. The person selected needs to be a volunteer, meet the<br/>qualifications and be willing and able to make the commitment. Every grade level might<br/>not necessarily have such a person. The key factors are having strong educators who<br/>exemplify the highest professional standards, operate for the public good, and are willing<br/>to be accountable for their work. The focus is on success for all children.</p>
<p>There should be a fail-back process in place in case there is difficulty in the selection<br/>process. Perhaps the administrator and two staff members can mediate the process.</p>
<p>One thing we’ve learned for sure - the process needs to be clearly described and<br/>presented to the whole staff.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM E</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>BETWEEN</p>
<p>CABRILLO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (CUSD)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>CABRILLO UNIFIED TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION (CUTA)</p>
<p>The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to clarify several 2006-2007<br/>pending issues between the Cabrillo Unified School District (CUSD) and the Cabrillo Unified<br/>School District Teachers’ Association (CUTA). The issues are described and agreed upon as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of both the Intermediate Tennis coach position from column B to column C<br/>and the Intermediate Athletic Director from column E to F on the Cocurricular and Special<br/>Assignment Salary Schedule. It is understood that the transfer to the new column will not affect<br/>the amount of money the district allocates to the intermediate cocurricular budget.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An A-l Column will be added to the 2006-2007 Cocurricular and Special Assignment<br/>Salary Schedule to include district committees that meet 11-15 times. The calculated payment for<br/>cocurricular Column A-l will be 1.96% times Step A-l from the salary schedule. Additionally,<br/>both the Leadership Team and Diversity Advisory Board committees will be placed on column A<br/>of the cocurricular salary schedule.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily compensation rate for CUSD CUTA staff that participate in a full professional<br/>work day (as defined in Normal Workday CUTA 13.1.1) outside the daily work hours and<br/>calendar work year shall be increased from a current daily rate of $150.00 to $187.00 for the<br/>2007-2008 school year. Furthermore, effective for the 2008-2009 school year, CUSD agrees to<br/>increase the daily rate equivalent to the per diem of Step A-l of the CUTA salary schedule. The<br/>aforementioned daily rates as well as any other incurred expenses are for work completed by<br/>CUTA staff that has received prior approval from district administration.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CUTA staff members that participate in grant funded staff development activities outside<br/>their daily work hours and calendar year shall be compensated in an honorarium capacity based<br/>on the availability of funding from the grant. CUTA staff members are eligible for professional<br/>growth units if staff development is paid for by the CUTA member. If the district pays for staff<br/>development, unit members are not eligible for professional growth units.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High School schedule utilized for the 2007-08 school year, will be reviewed at the<br/>end of the year.</p>

<p>TENTATIVE<br/>AGREEMENT BETWEEN<br/>CABRILLO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND<br/>CABRILLO UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>JOINT REQUEST TO GOVERNING BOARD FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF<br/>MINIMUM DAYS AND DISTRICT-WIDE STAFF DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>Pursuant to Appendix D of the negotiated Agreement, the District and the Association<br/>agree to make the following request to the Governing Board:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 2005-2006 school year, the teacher work year shall be 185<br/>days, consisting of 180 days of student instruction, 1 full-day staff development day,<br/>and 4 teacher workdays.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 4 teacher workdays, 2 will be at the beginning of the year, and one at the end<br/>of the year. The fourth workday will occur at the end of the first trimester or the end<br/>of the first semester (in 2005-2006 this is November 28, 2005 or January 20, 2006).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the fourth workday referred to above, each unit member shall be required to<br/>work on only one of the two scheduled days. Each site will establish a check-in<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be one full-day. District wide staff development day at the beginning of<br/>the year (in 2005-2006 this is August 24, 2005).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be six minimum days, which shall occur on the same day of the week at all<br/>schools in each of the following months: September, October, January, February,<br/>March and April.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be District -wide staff development activities on the minimum days<br/>specified in #5 above.</p>
<p>7 . The District Staff Development Committee will determine these District-wide staff<br/>development activities.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members shall be required to attend all District-wide staff development<br/>activities in their entirety. If such activities occur at a time that a unit member is not<br/>required to be at work based on his/her part-time assignment or job-share status, the<br/>unit member will be compensated for such attendance at the unit member's hourly<br/>rate (annual salary divided by 185 days divided by 8 hours).</p>
<p>Those unit members whose part-time work year is scheduled in semester increments<br/>shall not be required to attend staff development activities during the semester on<br/>which they are on leave of absence.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to accommodate the six minimum days provided herein, the annual school<br/>day schedules shall be adjusted to provide the same number of annual instructional<br/>minutes as occurred in the 2004-2005 school year.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This request is based on the parties' assumption that implementation will comply with<br/>the provisions of AB 825.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize that part of the reason for this agreement is due to the repeal of<br/>SB 1193 through the passage of AB 825. Therefore, Appendix 0 to the negotiated<br/>Agreement is hereby eliminated.</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>Although the repeal of SB 1193, and Appendix O could result in the reduction of the<br/>work year by eliminating three staff development days (187 days to 184 days), the<br/>parties are agreeing to maintain salaries based on 187 days, while establishing a 185-<br/>day work year. If in the future the District believes that changes in funding levels<br/>and/or methods of allocation of funding for block grants adversely impacts the<br/>District’s ability to maintain this salary schedule as described herein, the parties shall<br/>reopen negotiations over this subject upon the District’s request.</p>
<p>Dated: April 22, 2005 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2005</p>
<p>For Cabrillo Unified School District: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabrillo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unified&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association:</p>

<p>A Public Hearing on the CUTA Agreement between the Cabrillo Unified School District and the<br/>Cabrillo Teachers Association for the 2005-2006 through 2007-2008 school year will be<br/>provided.</p>

<p>Appendix E.1</p>
<p>COBRA</p>
<p>Answers to Your Most Commonly Asked Questions</p>
<p>Ql: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is COBRA?</p>
<p>A 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COBRA is an acronym for the 1986 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which became</p>
<p>effective August 1, 1986. This act makes two significant changes to employer group health plans.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it makes the employer health plan the primary coverage for active employees and their<br/>dependents, regardless of age. In the past, Medicare provided primary coverage for employees and their<br/>dependents who were covered by both parts of Medicare.</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, COBRA requires employers with 20 or more employees to continue health benefits'<br/>coverage for &quot;covered employees&quot; and their dependents who, due to certain qualifying events, lose<br/>eligibility under their group health plan.</p>
<p>Q 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is a &quot;covered employee&quot;?</p>
<p>A 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;covered employee&quot; is any individual who has coverage under a group plan on the date of a</p>
<p>qualifying event listed in #3 below. This definition also applies to a retiree or former employee who is<br/>covered by such a plan.</p>
<p>Q 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these qualifying events?</p>
<p>A 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifying events for employees are:</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separation from employment</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction in work hours below half-time<br/>Qualifying events for dependents are:</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the covered employee</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divorce</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal separation</p>
<p>♦ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a child is no longer a dependent of the employee</p>
<p>Q 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is a &quot;qualified beneficiary&quot; under COBRA?</p>
<p>A 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;qualified beneficiary&quot; is a covered employee, employee's spouse, or a dependent child who is</p>
<p>covered under the group plan on the day before a qualifying event.</p>
<p>Q 5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long must COBRA coverage be available to a qualified beneficiary?</p>
<p>A 5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum coverage period is 18 months after separating from employment or reducing work hours,</p>
<p>or 36 months for any other type of qualifying event.</p>
<p>Q 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How and when is a beneficiary notified of eligibility to continue under COBRA?</p>
<p>A 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the employer determines when a qualifying event has occurred and notifies the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of</p>
<p>his or her eligibility within 14 days. However, each covered employee or qualified beneficiary is<br/>responsible for notifying the employer of such qualifying events as a legal separation or divorce, or<br/>when a child is no longer a dependent.</p>
<p>Q 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the duration of the election period?</p>
<p>A 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election period begins on the day a beneficiary would lose coverage because of a qualifying event.</p>
<p>It ends 60 days after that date or 60 days after the beneficiary is notified of his or her right to elect<br/>COBRA continuation, whichever is later. If an election is made, coverage under COBRA must begin<br/>on the day a beneficiary would have otherwise lost coverage. An election is considered to be made on<br/>the date it is sent to the employer.</p>
<p>Q 8: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can each qualified beneficiary make an independent election under COBRA?</p>
<p>A 8: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, each qualified beneficiary must be offered the opportunity to elect COBRA coverage.</p>
<p>Q 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a qualified beneficiary who has elected COBRA add new family members?</p>
<p>A 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, COBRA participants enjoy the same rights as active employees in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualified</p>
<p>beneficiary has 60 days to add new family members. Otherwise, they may be added during an open<br/>enrollment period.</p>

<p>Board Policy</p>
<p>Community Relations</p>
<p>COMPLAINTS CONCERNING DISTRICT EMPLOYEES</p>
<p>The Governing Board accepts responsibility for providing a means by which the public<br/>can hold employees accountable for their actions. The Board desires that complaints be<br/>resolved expeditiously without disrupting the educational process.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall develop regulations which permit the public to<br/>submit complaints against district employees in an appropriate way. These regulations<br/>shall protect the rights of involved parties. The Board may serve as an appeals body if<br/>the complaint is not resolved.</p>
<p>(cf. 1312.2 - Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials)</p>
<p>(cf. 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures)</p>
<p>(cf. 3515.2 - Disruptions)</p>
<p>The Board prohibits retaliation against complainants. The Superintendent or designee at<br/>his/her discretion may keep a complainant's identity confidential, except to the extent<br/>necessary to investigate the complaint. The district will not investigate anonymous<br/>complaints unless it so desires.</p>
<p>When public complaints involve accusations of child abuse, the provisions of this policy<br/>and regulations shall be implemented only after the child abuse reporting requirements<br/>specified in law and BP 5141.4 have been completed.</p>
<p>(cf 5141.4 - Child Abuse Prevention and Reporting)</p>
<p>Upon request, parents/guardians shall receive procedures, written in their primary<br/>language, for filing a child abuse complaint with the appropriate child protective<br/>agencies. If any parent/guardian complains of child abuse occurring at a school, the<br/>Superintendent or designee shall provide him/her with these procedures and shall also<br/>provide an interpreter as needed for oral communication.</p>
<p>Providing the above procedures to parents/guardians does not relieve mandated reporters<br/>from their duty to report suspected child abuse in accordance with law.</p>

<p>ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1312.1</p>
<p>Community Relations<br/>COMPLAINTS CONCERNING DISTRICT EMPLOYEES</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall determine whether a complaint should be<br/>considered a complaint against the district and/or an individual employee, and whether it<br/>should be resolved by the district's process for complaints concerning personnel and/or<br/>other district procedures.</p>
<p>(cf. 1312.2 - Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials)</p>
<p>(cf. 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures)</p>
<p>(cf. 4144/4244/4344 - Complaints)</p>
<p>To promote prompt and fair resolution of the complaint, the following procedures shall<br/>govern the resolution of complaints against district employees:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort should be made to resolve a complaint at the earliest possible stage.<br/>Whenever possible, the complainant should communicate directly to the<br/>employee in order to resolve concerns.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a complainant is unable or unwilling to resolve the complaint directly with the<br/>employee, he/she may submit an oral or written complaint to the employee's<br/>immediate supervisor or the principal.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All complaints related to district personnel other than administrators shall be<br/>submitted in writing to the principal or immediate supervisor. If the complainant<br/>is unable to prepare the complaint in writing, administrative staff shall help<br/>him/her to do so. Complaints related to a principal or central office administrator<br/>shall be initially filed in writing with the Superintendent or designee. Complaints<br/>related to the Superintendent shall be initially filed in writing with the Board.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a written complaint is received, the employee shall be notified within five<br/>work days or in accordance with collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written complaint shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full name of each employee involved</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summary of the complaint and the facts surrounding it</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific description of any prior attempt to discuss the complaint with<br/>the employee and the failure to resolve the matter</p>
<p>Appendix L</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff responsible for investigating complaints shall attempt to resolve the<br/>complaint to the satisfaction of the parties involved within 30 days.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the complainant and the employee against whom the complaint was made<br/>may appeal a decision by the principal or immediate supervisor to the<br/>Superintendent or designee, who shall attempt to resolve the complaint to the<br/>satisfaction of the person involved within 30 days. Parties should consider and<br/>accept the Superintendent or designee's decision as final. However, the<br/>complainant, the employee, or the Superintendent or designee may ask to address<br/>the Board regarding the complaint.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before any Board consideration of a complaint, the Superintendent or designee<br/>shall submit to the Board a written report concerning the complaint, including but<br/>not limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full name of each employee involved</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summary of the complaint and the facts surrounding it,<br/>sufficient to inform the Board and the parties as to the precise nature of the<br/>complaint and to allow the parties to prepare a response</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the signed original complaint</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of the action taken by the Superintendent or designee, together<br/>with his/her specific finding that the problem has not been resolved and<br/>the reasons</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may uphold the Superintendent's decision without hearing the<br/>complaint.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties to a complaint may be asked to attend a Board meeting in order to<br/>clarify the issue and present all available evidence.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A closed session may be held to hear the complaint in accordance with law.</p>
<p>(cf. 9321 - Closed Session Purposes and Agendas)</p>
<p>(cf. 9323 - Meeting Conduct)</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Board shall be final.</p>
<p>Any complaint of child abuse or neglect alleged against a district employee shall be<br/>reported to the appropriate local agencies in accordance with law, Board policy and<br/>administrative regulation.</p>
