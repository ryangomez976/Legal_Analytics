<p>action or proceeding referred to in this Agreement shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, or<br/>appealed.</p>
<p>4.7 The District, upon receiving a revocable written authorization from the unit member shall deduct from the<br/>salary and make appropriate remittance for annuities, saving bonds, credit unions, charitable donations, or<br/>any other plan jointly approved by the District and the Association.

<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance is an allegation by one or more unit members that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of the specific provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant is a member of the bargaining unit or the Association alleging a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of a specific provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day is defined as a day when the schools in the district are in session excluding summer school.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Resolution. Before filing a formal grievance, the grievant will attempt to resolve the grievance<br/>by means of an informal conference with the immediate supervisor or the appropriate administrator.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Resolution, Level One. Within twenty (20) days after the occurrence of the act of omission giving<br/>rise to the grievance, or within twenty (20) days time the grievant could reasonably have known of the act or<br/>omission, the grievant must file a formal written grievance.</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written statement of the grievance shall include the general and specific grounds of the<br/>grievance, the date or dates the alleged act or omission occurred, the specific provisions of the<br/>Agreement alleged to have been violated, misinterpreted or misapplied, and any other pertinent<br/>information which might assist the District in determining the proper resolution of the grievance. It<br/>shall also include a statement of the specific action which the aggrieved unit member desires that<br/>the District take to remedy the grievance and a statement of the outcome resulting form the Informal<br/>Resolution as described in Section 2.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall communicate the decision to the grievant in writing within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the grievance. If the administrator does not respond within the time limits, the<br/>grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limits either party may request a personal conference.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Resolution, Level Two. In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision rendered at<br/>Level One, the grievant may appeal the decision on the appropriate form to the Superintendent or designee<br/>with ten (10) days.</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee shall communicate the decision to the grievant within 10<br/>days. If the Superintendent or designee does not respond within the time limits provided, the<br/>grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>6.4.2. Within the above time limits, either party may request a personal conference.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Resolution, Level Three. If the grievant is not satisfied with the solution or no decision has been<br/>made at Level Two, the grievant may request the Association to submit the grievance to arbitration. If the<br/>Association decides to submit the grievance to arbitration, the Association and the District shall attempt to<br/>agree on an arbitrator. If no agreement can be reached, they shall request the State Conciliation Service to<br/>supply a panel of five (5) names of persons experienced in conducting grievance arbitration hearings. Each<br/>party shall alternately strike a name until only one (1) name remains. The remaining panel member shall be<br/>the arbitrator. The order of striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>6.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expense of the arbitrator in the hearing shall be borne equally by the District and the<br/>Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>6.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the issue or issues<br/>submitted. If the parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the arbitrator shall determine<br/>the issues by referring to the written grievance and the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>6.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change, or add to, or subtract from any of the<br/>terms of this Agreement, but shall determine only whether or not there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Agreement in the respect alleged in the grievance. The<br/>decision of the arbitrator shall be based upon the evidence and argument presented to him/her by the<br/>respective parties and upon generally accepted rules of contract construction and interpretation.</p>
<p>6.5 .4 The function and purpose of the arbitrator is to determine disputed interpretation of terms actually<br/>found in the Agreement, or to determine disputed facts upon which the application of the<br/>Agreement depends. The arbitrator shall therefore, not have authority, nor shall he/she consider it<br/>his/her function to decide any issue not submitted or to so interpret or apply the Agreement as to<br/>change what can clearly be said to have been the intent of the parties as determined by generally<br/>accepted rules of contract construction. Past practice of the parties in interpreting or applying terms<br/>of the Agreement may be utilized by the arbitrator in accordance with generally accepted rules of<br/>contract construction and application. The arbitrator shall not render any decision or award, or fail<br/>to render any decision or award, merely because in his/her opinion such decision or award is fair or<br/>equitable.</p>
<p>6.5.5. The decision of the arbitrator within the limits herein prescribed shall be binding upon the<br/>Association, the District, and the grievant.</p>
<p>6.5.6 Any dispute arising out of or in any way connected with either the existence or the exercise of rights<br/>of the District is not subject to the Grievance provisions set forth in this Article, unless the dispute is<br/>otherwise grievable under another Article or the Agreement.</p>
<p>6.6 Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>6.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the immediate supervisor. Superintendent or the designee fails to comply with the time limits set<br/>forth, the grievant may process the grievance to the next level of the grievance procedure.

<p>6.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of the grievance shall be<br/>filed separately from the personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>6.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the District or by any member or representative of the<br/>District against the Association, a grievant or person who assisted the grievant. No reprisals of any<br/>kind shall be taken by the Association or any unit member against either the grievant, the District or<br/>any District unit member who may have participated directly or indirectly in the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>6.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievants, representatives of the grievants, and witnesses shall be provided reasonable release time<br/>for the purpose of processing grievances in accordance with Section 3543.1 of the Educational<br/>Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>6.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any unit member<br/>having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member of the<br/>administration and to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by the Association as long as<br/>the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration, the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms and<br/>conditions of this Agreement and provided the District shall not agree to a resolution of a grievance<br/>until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been<br/>given an opportunity to file a response.</p>

<p>7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Learning Communities (PLC) -</p>
<p>The purpose of Professional Learning Communities shall be to provide for teacher collaboration<br/>around the common vision of improving teaching and student learning. Fidelity to the model<br/>requires the development of a common curriculum and common assessments. Sharing of<br/>assessment data is for the purpose of improving core instruction and designing and implementing<br/>effective and efficient intervention strategies. To that end, it is important that PLCs occur in an<br/>atmosphere of professional trust among both teachers and administrators.</p>
<p>Accordingly, evaluations shall be conducted per provisions of the Agreement and the California<br/>Education Code. Unit member rights are neither expanded nor diminished as the result of<br/>participation in PLC and in common assessments.</p>
<p>During each school year, unit members shall meet in Professional Learning Communities a<br/>maximum of thirty (30) total meetings of approximately one (1) hour each. Attendance at PLC<br/>meetings shall be punctual and consistent. Following each PLC meeting, a written summary of the<br/>meeting shall be provided to the site administrator in a timely fashion, as mutually agreed to by site<br/>administration and the site’s PLCs. Site administration shall establish an accessible storage area<br/>where meeting summaries of the site’s PLCs shall be filed and made available for unit member<br/>access.</p>
<p>The vitality and fidelity of the PLC process will be maintained through an annual review with<br/>LaBUFA leadership and administration.</p>

<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations of student work shall be reported to students in a timely manner, and when grade<br/>level appropriate, the online grading system shall be used to regularly communicate student<br/>performance. Specific definitions of “timely” and “regularly” shall be determined by the<br/>principal in consultation with the site staff and/or departments at the beginning of each school<br/>year.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting</p>
<p>7.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members at the intermediate or high school shall not normally be required to substitute during<br/>their preparation periods except in the event of sudden illness, accident, emergency, or when<br/>substitutes are not available. However, if a unit member does provide substitute service during<br/>his/her conference/planning period, he/she will receive compensation calculated at $25 per period.</p>

<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood by the parties that at the secondary level, class size shall be computed by adding the number<br/>of students in all regular classroom sections (exclusive of those listed above and applicable class size<br/>reduction programs) and dividing by the number of classroom sections.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a sabbatical leave of absence, when a unit member must be replaced in order to meet the class<br/>size average by a person who has rights of reemployment due to layoff, Vi of the unit member on sabbatical<br/>shall be computed in the division for purposes of computing the average class size.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist services will be provided during this Agreement according to the following ratios:</p>
<p>8.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Nurse, 1:3,000</p>
<p>8.72 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle School Counselor, 1:700</p>

<p>TRANSFER OF UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer refers to any action, which results in the movement of a unit member from the position that the<br/>unit member holds to a position at another school site.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A re-assignment is defined as a change in grade level, subject, or assignment within a given school.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that all unit members are employees of the District and not a particular school. Every effort<br/>shall be made to make transfers and re-assignments voluntary whenever possible.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not make transfers or re-assignments arbitrarily, capriciously or for disciplinary reasons.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers may occur as a result of a request either by an individual unit member or by the District.</p>
<p>Transfers may be “voluntary” when the unit member agrees to the transfer or the transfer may be<br/>“involuntary” when the unit member is transferred without this consent.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers shall be made and completed by July 15 of the new school year, recognizing that unexpected<br/>vacancies may necessitate additional reassignments.</p>
<p>9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Transfer Procedure</p>
<p>9.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures to be followed in the unit member-initialed request for voluntary transfer are:</p>
<p>9.7 .1.1 A list of position vacancies within the District shall be published by the Personnel Office on<br/>May 1, or within five (5) days after vacancies occur. The list shall contain a closing date<br/>for submitting requests for transfer. For each position posted, the notice shall show: School<br/>subject area(s) and/or grade level. No assignment to fill the vacancies shall be made until<br/>after the closing date.</p>
<p>9.7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members must request voluntary transfers by submitting a “Request for Transfer” form<br/>to the Personnel Office by March 15, or within ten (10) days of the date of posting the<br/>vacancy announcement. Such statement shall include the grade and/or subject to which the<br/>unit member desires to be transferred, in order of preferences.</p>
<p>9.7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members within the District will receive first consideration for any vacancies for<br/>which they are qualified and a formal interview will be granted when requested by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>9.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making a recommendation to fill the vacancy, hiring personnel will consider the instructional<br/>needs, and individual qualifications, enrollment and seniority of the unit member.</p>
<p>9.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member making a voluntary transfer during the school year shall be granted, upon request, a<br/>minimum of one (1) day release time, without loss of compensation, to move and prepare for the<br/>new assignment.</p>
<p>9.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a transfer is not granted, upon request, written rationale for the denial will be made. If a unit<br/>member’s request for transfer has been denied, a renewed request for the next year shall be<br/>considered, unless there is no available position to which the unit member can be transferred or an<br/>adequate replacement for the unit member cannot be obtained. <sup>15</sup></p>
<p>15</p>
<p>9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer Procedure</p>
<p>9.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an involuntary transfer is necessary, the following criteria will be considered: seniority,<br/>credential, previous experience, instructional needs of the educational program.</p>
<p>9.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before any involuntary transfer is affected, the unit member must be advised, through personal<br/>notice by the principal initiating the request that an involuntary transfer is being recommended.

<p>9.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A current list of the District’s vacant positions shall be made available to each unit member being<br/>considered for an involuntary transfer. A unit member may indicate his preferences and reasonable<br/>effort shall be made to place the unit member in a position of his preference. If involuntarily<br/>transferred, the unit member shall be given special priority consideration for voluntary transfer<br/>during the next school year.</p>
<p>9.8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of any proposed involuntary transfer shall be given the affected unit member as soon as<br/>possible, but no less than five (5) working days prior to the effective date of transfer.</p>

<p>9.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-Assignment Procedure</p>
<p>9.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration may reassign a certificated unit member within the same school, considering the<br/>following non-ranked criteria (listed alphabetically):</p>
<p>Credential</p>
<p>Expertise</p>
<p>Prior Re-assignments</p>
<p>Seniority</p>
<p>Staff Preferences</p>
<p>Training or Special Qualifications</p>
<p>9.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a re-assignment is made, the unit member must be advised, through personal notice by the<br/>principal initiating the request that a re-assignment is being recommended.

After a unit member has had a<br/>sabbatical leave, an additional seven (7) years must be served before becoming eligible for another<br/>sabbatical leave</p>
<p>12.17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any school year, the Board may grant those sabbaticals that the Board believes will best serve the<br/>educational programs of the District.</p>

<p>12.17.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall review all qualifying applications and forward them with the designations to<br/>the Superintendent and the Board. The School Board, in making its decision, will consider the scale<br/>rankings submitted by the Sabbatical Leave Committee in conjunction with their review of the<br/>quality of the proposal presented as it related to the goals and needs of the District.</p>
<p>12.17.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who has been granted a Sabbatical Leave may request that the leave be cancelled<br/>and be returned to District service. Such a request may be granted prior to the effective date of<br/>leave, or at a semester break during the leave, providing that a vacancy exists for which the unit<br/>member qualifies. <sup>27</sup></p>
<p>27</p>
<p>12.17.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member granted such a leave shall receive fifty percent (5 0%) of his regular salary. The<br/>unit member shall have the option of continuing the health and welfare benefits upon the unit<br/>member’s payment of the premiums. The unit member on leave may elect to be paid in one of three<br/>ways:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary for the unit member granted a leave for less than one year may be paid during<br/>the first year of service rendered following the return of the unit member from the leave of<br/>absence.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary of the unit member granted a leave for a period of one year may be paid in two<br/>equal annual installments during the first two years of service following the return of the<br/>unit member.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary may be paid in the same manner as if the unit member were teaching in the<br/>District upon furnishing a suitable bond indemnifying the Board against loss in the event<br/>the unit member fails to render at least a period equal to twice the period of leave following<br/>return from leave. The Board has the prerogative to waive this requirement.</p>
<p>12.17.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave shall be considered as time in District for schedule purposes and for retirement<br/>purposes. Retirement deductions shall be made in proportion to the salary received.</p>
<p>12.17.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of the leave and within forty-five (45) days of the unit member’s return to duty,<br/>the unit member shall submit one of the following to the Superintendent:</p>

<p>12.17.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall agree to return to service in the District for a period equal to twice the period</p>
<p>of leave.</p>
<p>12.17.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it should be determined by the Sabbatical Leave Committee that the intent of the Sabbatical<br/>Leave was not fulfilled, the District may take action to recover the District’s incurred cost. Failure<br/>to provide the required report at the conclusion of the Sabbatical Leave is considered to be a failure<br/>to fulfill a condition of the leave.</p>
<p>12.17.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise agreed, the unit member shall be reinstated in the same or equivalent position held<br/>at the time of the Board granting the Sabbatical Leave of Absence. <sup>28</sup></p>

<p>12.18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two tenured teachers currently employed by the District, with the approval of the principal, may<br/>share one teaching position for a minimum of one year, provided the Superintendent determines<br/>each year this is in the best interest of the District. Job Shares shall not normally be approved for<br/>more than two consecutive years from the effective date of this section. In the event that a second-<br/>year probationary employee requests a job share for the following year in which he or she<br/>anticipates achieving permanent status, and meets all other criteria specified in Article 12.18,<br/>contingent approval may be granted, provided the employee achieves permanent status for the<br/>following school year.

<p>12.18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of teaching partnerships will not exceed 10% of the number of teaching positions<br/>per site. Job Shares shall not normally be for more than two consecutive years from the effective<br/>date of this provision. In the event that there are fewer Job Share applications than permitted by<br/>this section for a new year, any current partnership may continue in accord with this article’s<br/>provisions.</p>
<p>12.18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers entering into a Job Share shall be considered to be full-time teachers entering into a<br/>partial leave of absence. As a result, they retain all rights to regain full-time employment enjoyed<br/>by any employee on a leave of absence.</p>
<p>12.18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit members requesting the Job Share shall jointly submit a written request to the District<br/>Office specifying the number of days for which the leave is requested, the inclusive dates, and the<br/>reasons for which the leave is requested.

<p>12.18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary and benefits shall be prorated according to the percentage of the Job Share with the<br/>employee being responsible for paying for the remaining prorated premium cost. In no event shall<br/>the total amount of health and welfare benefits for the Job Shares exceed the amount the District<br/>would have paid if the position had not been shared.

As specifically cited by the<br/>Legislature, the PAR Program is intended to be a “critical feedback mechanism that allows exemplary<br/>teachers to assist veteran teachers in need of development in subject matter knowledge or teaching<br/>strategies, or both.” The District and the Association also agree that the PAR Program in any school year<br/>may be contingent upon the actual receipt by the District of adequate funding from the State specifically<br/>designated for the PAR Program. The District may take any action so that the District does not lose any<br/>funding under the PAR Program as long as such action is consistent with this Article and there is prior<br/>consultation with the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel. Pursuant to Education Code section<br/>44506(c), the District also may expend PAR Program funds from the State for any other allowable purpose<br/>which includes, but is not limited to, any program that supports the training and development of new<br/>teachers as long as there is prior consultation with the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel.</p>

In order to be on the ballot, a permanent teacher must submit a written communication<br/>to the Association expressly indicating a desire to be on the ballot, and also expressly indicating a<br/>commitment to perform all the required duties of the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel for the<br/>school year. The Superintendent or designee and the Association President may seek applicants for the Joint<br/>Teacher-Administrator Review Panel.</p>
<p>The teacher on the ballot receiving the most number of votes from the classroom teachers actually voting at<br/>each site shall be appointed to the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel include the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the consulting teachers by majority vote for the school year consistent with this Article and<br/>applicable law. The number of consulting teachers shall be determined by the number of teachers<br/>participating in the PAR Program, which, in any year, may require no consulting teachers. As required by<br/>Education Code section 44502 (c) (2), before a consulting teacher is selected, the Joint Teacher-<br/>Administrator Review Panel shall conduct at least one classroom observation of the candidate, which shall<br/>be arranged and scheduled by the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review and recommend whether to combine the District’s PAR Program with those of any other school<br/>districts as authorized by Education Code section 44503 (d).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign each consulting teacher to a specific program participant with the approval of the Joint Teacher-<br/>Administrator Review Panel. If a program participant disagrees with the consulting teacher assigned to<br/>him/her, an appeal may be made in writing to the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel. Any such<br/>appeal must be made within five (5) calendar days and must specify the reason(s) for the appeal. The Joint<br/>Teacher-Administrator Review Panel shall make the final decision on whether to continue the assignment of<br/>the consulting teacher.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review peer review reports of program participants prepared by consulting teachers. <sup>43</sup></p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make confidential written recommendations to the Governing Board regarding participants in the PAR<br/>Program, including forwarding the names of any participants in the PAR Program who, after sustained<br/>assistance for a school year, are not able to demonstrate satisfactory improvement. Program participants<br/>may participate for more than one year with the approval of the PAR Review Panel. These written<br/>recommendations will be reviewed in closed session. Members of the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review<br/>Panel shall not disclose the confidential written recommendations except to the Superintendent or designee<br/>and the Governing Board.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annually evaluate the impact of the PAR Program and submit recommendations for improvement to the<br/>Governing Board and the Association no later than June 15. This annual evaluation may include, but is not<br/>limited to, interviews or surveys of program participants.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any consulting teachers selected by majority vote of the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel shall<br/>meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any permanent classroom teacher who has experience as a classroom teacher for at least five (5) years.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstrated exemplary teaching ability, as indicated by, among other things, effective communication,<br/>subject matter knowledge, and mastery of a range of teaching strategies necessary to meet the needs of<br/>pupils in different contexts.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evaluation document designating any needs improvement or unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a member of the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers to be a consulting teacher and agrees to perform all duties faithfully and competently. In the<br/>event that there is not a sufficient number of volunteers, the Superintendent, designee, or Association<br/>president shall recommend candidates to the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel who meet all the<br/>other eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of any consulting teachers shall include the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional assistance to program participants to improve teaching skills and subject matter knowledge.<br/>Education Code section 44500 (b) (4) provides that there shall be a cooperative relationship between the<br/>consulting teacher and the principal with respect to the process of peer assistance and review. The<br/>professional assistance should include, but not be limited to, specific written suggestions for improvement,<br/>sample instructional materials, possible specific lesson plans, and advice on available resources.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare written peer review reports of program participants and submit them to the Joint Teacher-<br/>Administrator Review Panel no later than May 1. The peer review reports shall be based upon clear<br/>performance goals established at the beginning of the peer review process which shall be in writing, aligned<br/>with pupil learning, and consistent with Education Code section 44662 (a provision in the Stull Act).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer review reports also shall be based on no less than four (4) classroom observations of at least forty-<br/>five (45) minutes each for each program participant and on no less than two (2) conferences with each<br/>program participant regarding classroom observations. Since the classroom observations require released<br/>time for the consultant teacher, such observations must be scheduled with the approval of the principal.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent classroom teacher shall become a program participant under any of the following two (2)<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the previous school year, the teacher received any unsatisfactory rating in the areas of subject<br/>matter expertise, instructional strategies, classroom management, student learning environment, and<br/>planning effective lessons on an evaluation report completed by an administrator.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher volunteers to participate and the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel and the<br/>Superintendent or designee agrees to the participation. <sup>44</sup></p>
<p>44</p>
<p>If, in any school year, there is a small number of or no program participants, the Superintendent or designee,<br/>after consultation with the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel, may determine to provide<br/>professional assistance under the PAR Program generally to all classroom teachers, to reduce or eliminate<br/>consulting teachers, and to utilize PAR Program monies for various activities such as curriculum<br/>development or staff development.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer review reports completed by the consulting teacher shall be placed in the personnel file of the program<br/>participant within ten (10) calendar days of delivery to the program participant, the Joint Teacher-<br/>Administrator Review Panel, and the Superintendent or designee. A volunteer program participant may<br/>determine that any peer review report shall not be placed in his/her personnel file. Peer review reports are<br/>confidential documents, which should be treated as such. Both the program participant and the<br/>Superintendent or designee may submit a written response which will be attached to the peer review report<br/>in the personnel file prior to the end of the ten-day period. A written response by the program participant is<br/>the sole remedy to the peer review report. A peer review report is not a substitute for an evaluation done by<br/>an administrator and does not supercede an evaluation by an administrator.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four (4) classroom teachers selected to the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel and any<br/>consultant teachers selected by the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel are not considered to be<br/>either management or supervisory employees for purposes of the Educational Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four (4) classroom teachers selected to the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel and any<br/>consultant teachers selected by the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel shall have the same<br/>protection from liability and access to appropriate defense as other employees acting within the scope of<br/>employment under relevant provisions of the Government Code.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the four (4) permanent classroom teachers on the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel will be<br/>required to perform duties related to their assignment on the Joint Teacher-Administrator Review Panel<br/>outside of the regular work day, each shall receive $25 per hour. However, if the funding actually received<br/>during the school year from the State specifically designated for the PAR Program is less than the budgeted<br/>and anticipated amount, then the stipend will be decreased by an amount proportional to the decrease in<br/>State funding.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since any consulting teacher will be required to perform duties related to his/her assignment as a consulting<br/>teacher outside of the regular work day, each shall receive an annual stipend of $4,000 for each teacher who<br/>is a participant in the PAR Program and who is actually served by the consulting teacher for an entire school<br/>year. This amount shall be prorated if the service is for less than an entire school year. However, if the<br/>funding actually received during the school year from the State specifically designated for the PAR Program<br/>is less than the budgeted and anticipated amount, then the stipend will be decreased by an amount<br/>proportional to the decrease in State funding.</p>
