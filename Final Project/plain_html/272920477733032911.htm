<p>When split assignments occur, the unit member will have the equivalency of five<br/>(5) teaching periods and one (1) preparation period.</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An immediate administrator’s assignment of teacher preparations to<br/>employees shall be consistent with the above. Teaching preparations as used<br/>herein shall refer to different course titles.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the work day/work week requirements described above, the<br/>unit members shall be required, without additional compensation, to render such<br/>additional duties as are normally required of the education professions and<br/>which are consistent with past District practices, e.g.. Open House, Parent<br/>Conferences, Back-to-School Night, school-wide activities, student supervision<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>7.6.1 As determined by the site administration, elementary and middle<br/>school sites may schedule up to two (2) after school/evening programs in<br/>any academic year which require staff attendance. High schools will not<br/>exceed four (4) after school/evening programs in any academic year and<br/>such duties shall not occur outside of the District. Special programs,<br/>generated by unit members and not requiring attendance, may occur beyond<br/>the stated requirement. ■</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall make a good faith effort to assign adjunct<br/>duty service in a manner that tends to equitably distribute it among unit<br/>members assigned to the work site. Employees working less than 1.0 shall be<br/>assigned a proportionate amount of assigned duties corresponding to their<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should any adjunct duty occur during evening hours, unit members may leave<br/>on that day five (5) minutes after the safe dismissal of students, based on the<br/>normal work day of each site. Further, such dismissal will occur preceding any<br/>holiday.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>7.9 The work year for all bargaining unit members shall be 184/194 days as<br/>applicable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equivalent of one (1) work day shall be designated as a</p>

<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District shall meet and confer and finalize their<br/>recommended school calendar prior to the first Board Meeting in May. On the<br/>school calendar, spring break will occur no earlier than the last week of the<br/>third quarter.</p>
<p>7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students shall observe a minimum day schedule on the last day of classes<br/>prior to summer vacation which is consistent with the minimum day schedule<br/>observed during the school year.</p>
<p>7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student school day for teachers assigned to grades 1-5 at Elementary<br/>Schools shall be structured during a normal' week, Monday through Friday, to<br/>provide 315 minutes of teacher-student contact time on every day except for<br/>Thursdays, when the teacher-student contact will be 265 minutes. Thursday will<br/>be a planning day. The planning day will remain on Thursdays, regardless of<br/>school holidays, and will not be rescheduled should a holiday fall on Thursday.<br/>The time from the bell signaling students to come in from the playground to<br/>begin the school day and from the bell during subsequent recesses is included<br/>as part of the student-teacher contact time. The planning time provided by the<br/>early release of students on Thursday shall be used for lesson planning and<br/>preparation. Preparation time is intended to provide unit members time to<br/>think, plan, and work on projects in preparation for improving the quality and<br/>delivery of classroom instruction. Staff development activities and/or<br/>meetings should not be planned or scheduled during this time by administration,<br/>except for serious reasons or emergencies. However, grades 1-5 teachers<br/>continue subject to the provisions of paragraphs 7.1 - 7.3 and 7.6 - 7.11<br/>above.</p>
<p>7.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the Parties to improve elementary teachers' planning<br/>and preparation time through a collaborative process. The Parties understand<br/>there will be no standard solution for each site.</p>
<p>Teachers will be released from enrichment classes such as Music, Art and<br/>Physical Education when a certificated teacher is providing instruction and<br/>supervision of the students. When released, the classroom teacher shall have<br/>preparation time. Teacher preparation time will normally be given priority for<br/>those lunch time minutes in excess of the duty free lunch.</p>
<p>It is agreed that, with advance approval from a site administrator:</p>
<p>Teachers may combine classes for the purpose of team-teaching in order to allow<br/>one teacher to be released for planning and preparation.</p>
<p>Teachers may alter their daily schedule in order to create blocks of time for<br/>planning and preparation. For example a teacher may arrive to work earlier</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>than the usual start time and leave earlier than the normal ending time for<br/>work.</p>
<p>Teachers may be released from assemblies on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>7.14 Employees may be assigned during a preparatory period(s) to provide needed<br/>instruction/coverage. In the event the employee has a schedule conflict, the<br/>Principal shall consider such conflict in making the assignment. Volunteers<br/>shall be sought first and consideration should be given to equitable<br/>distribution of assignments. Commencing the 2002-2003 school year, a monthly<br/>report of teachers who have been asked and who have provided substitute<br/>coverage during their preparation period will be provided to CUTA by the 15<sup>th<br/></sup>of each month. A yearly summary will be provided at the beginning of each<br/>school year.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8</p>
<p>NON-DISCRIMINATION</p>
<p>8.1 The Board shall not discriminate against unit members in the administration<br/>of this agreement on the basis of age, race, creed, color, religion, national<br/>origin or ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, domicile, marital status,<br/>political affiliation, physical or mental disability, medical condition<br/>including genetic characteristics, physical handicap, membership or<br/>participation in an employee organization, or on any other basis prohibited by<br/>law.</p>

If<br/>requested by the District, a unit member shall not return to work<br/>until s/he submits a medical doctor's authorization to return to<br/>work.</p>

<p>entitlement for the school year. Such statement shall be expressed<br/>in total hours and total days and shall be provided to the unit<br/>members not later than October 1 of each school year.</p>

Catastrophic Leave Bank unit member<br/>participants who are drawing from the Bank at the time of<br/>the assessment will not be required to contribute to remain<br/>eligible to draw from the bank. If a Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank unit member participant has no remaining sick leave at<br/>the time of the assessment, he/she need not contribute the<br/>additional day to remain a participant in the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank.</p>
<p>15.20.2.7.2. If the number of days in the Bank at the<br/>beginning of a school year exceeds 500 days, no contribution<br/>shall be required of returning CUSD certificated employees.<br/>Those CUSD certificated employees joining the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank for the first time and those returning from leave<br/>shall be required to contribute one day to the Bank.</p>
<p>Withdrawal from the Bank</p>
<p>15.20.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who have<br/>exhausted all available paid, leave may withdraw from the Bank for<br/>catastrophic illness or injury. Catastrophic illness or injury<br/>shall be defined as any illness or injury that incapacitates a<br/>unit member or a member of the unit member's family for over ten<br/>(10) consecutive duty days which requires the unit member to take<br/>time off work to care for that immediate family member. Immediate<br/>family shall be defined to include spouse or registered domestic<br/>partner, child, parents, other person living in the immediate<br/>household, or a dependent living outside the household. If a<br/>reoccurrence of a second illness or injury incapacitates a unit<br/>member or member of the unit member's family within 12 months, it<br/>shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5) consecutive days.</p>
<p>15.20.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CUSD certificated employees must use all available<br/>paid leave before being eligible for a withdrawal from the Bank.</p>
<p>15.20.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is incapacitated, applications may be<br/>submitted to the Committee by the participant's agent or member of<br/>the unit member's family.</p>
<p>15.20.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be<br/>granted in units of no more than 10 duty days. Only those days<br/>actually used will be transferred to the unit member. CUSD<br/>certificated employees may submit requests within one academic<br/>year for extensions of withdrawals as their prior grants expire.</p>
<p>15.20.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CUSD certificated employees applying to withdraw or<br/>extend their withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be<br/>required to submit a doctor's statement to the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank committee indicating the nature of the illness or injury and<br/>the probable length of absence from work. A unit member's</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>withdrawal may not exceed the statutory maximum period of 30 work<br/>days/225 hours within the academic year.</p>
<p>15.20.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has drawn 10 Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>days and requests an extension, the Committee may require a<br/>medical review by a physician of the District's choice at the unit<br/>member's expense. The District shall choose only a physician who<br/>qualifies under the negotiated insurance policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refusal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to</p>
<p>submit to the medical review will terminate the unit member's<br/>continued withdrawal from the Bank. Committee may deny an<br/>extension of withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank based<br/>upon the recommendation of the Assistant Superintendent as a<br/>result of the medical report.</p>
<p>15.20.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or</p>
<p>disability which qualifies the unit member for worker compensation<br/>benefits unless the unit member has exhausted all worker<br/>compensation leave and his/her own sick leave. In addition, the<br/>unit member must sign over any worker compensation checks for<br/>temporary benefits to the District. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are any worker</p>
<p>compensation checks signed over to the District, the Bank will not<br/>be charged days, or if charged, will be reimbursed the number of<br/>days for which the worker compensation payment is equivalent to a<br/>regular day of pay at the negotiated rate for that unit member.<br/>If the District challenges the worker compensation claim, the unit<br/>member may draw from the Bank, but upon settlement of the claim,<br/>the Bank shall be reimbursed the days by the District.</p>
<p>15.20.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have<br/>sufficient days to fund a withdrawal request, the Committee is<br/>under no obligation to provide days and the District is under no<br/>obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If the<br/>Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension of<br/>withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the request, they<br/>shall notify the unit member, in writing, of the reason for the<br/>denial.</p>
<p>15.20.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exception to the Grievance Clause:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee's</p>
<p>denial of a unit member's request to use of hours from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall not be subject to the Grievance<br/>Procedure.</p>

<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning each year's enrollment of students and regular classroom<br/>teachers, the District will initially employ sufficient number of regular<br/>classroom teachers not to exceed a ratio of 32-1 total general education<br/>classroom teachers to total general education students on a District-wide basis<br/>(i.e. total general education student count divided by total general education<br/>teacher count = 32). Should a reduction in staff occur pursuant to the lay off<br/>procedures of the Education Code, the Governing Board may increase class size.<br/>The remaining effects of the lay off will be negotiated with the Association.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a District-wide ratio greater than 32-1 occurs during the school<br/>year because of enrollment growth or population changes, the District will<br/>consider various alternatives that may result in adjustment of teacher/student<br/>ratios for the subsequent semester.</p>
<p>Such alternatives may include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>18.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment or rescheduling of students.</p>
<p>18.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realignment of attendance areas.</p>

This mutual<br/>agreement shall be documented in writing using the 5-Year Evaluation<br/>Cycle Agreement form.</p>

<p>goals, he/she may submit a written statement indicating why the<br/>evaluator's goals and objectives are not appropriate for his/her class or<br/>assignment. The evaluatee's statement, as described herein, shall become<br/>a part of the official evaluation documentation.</p>
<p>19.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If during the course of the evaluation period, mitigating<br/>circumstances arise which may require modification of the evaluation<br/>goals and objectives, the necessity for modification of the evaluation<br/>goals and objectives may be initiated by the evaluator or evaluatee, and<br/>any amended goals and objectives shall be arrived at in accordance with<br/>the above paragraph.</p>
<p>19.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation shall include at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one classroom/assignment</p>
<p>observation. Negative comments shall not be included in the final<br/>evaluation, unless the evaluatee has previously been notified, in</p>

At this<br/>conference, the employee and supervisor shall review and evaluate<br/>achievement of prior goals. A written summary of that conference shall<br/>be prepared, one copy for the employee, one for the supervisor, and one<br/>for the personnel file. If there is a disagreement, this shall be noted<br/>in the written summary.</p>
<p>19.1.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event an employee receives an evaluation stating<br/>&quot;unsatisfactory&quot; service, the evaluator shall provide the evaluatee with<br/>specific recommendations as to areas of needed improvement in the<br/>evaluatee's performance, and the evaluator shall endeavor to assist the<br/>evaluatee to improve performance.</p>
<p>19.1.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be required to participate in the<br/>evaluation of other unit members, nor shall any self evaluation be<br/>included in the formal evaluation.</p>
<p>19.1.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process established by the District shall not be<br/>in conflict with the provisions of this Article or prevailing state law.</p>
<p>19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCES</p>

<p>19.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following provisions shall apply to any evaluation</p>
<p>documentation file that an immediate administrator may maintain at<br/>his/her work stations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may have reasonable access to</p>

<p>ARTICLE 20</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROVISIONS</p>
<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance is defined as an alleged violation, misapplication or<br/>misinterpretation by a unit member that the District has violated a specific<br/>term of this agreement and that by reason of such violation his/her rights have<br/>been adversely affected. All other matters and disputes of any nature are<br/>beyond the scope of these procedures. Also excluded from these procedures are<br/>those matters so indicated elsewhere in this agreement.</p>
<p>A Level 1 - Informal grievance may be filed by the Association. If that<br/>grievance continues to or beyond Level 1 - Informal, it shall name the<br/>aggrieved unit member and join him/her as the grievant.</p>
<p>20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent in all cases shall be the District itself, rather than any<br/>individuals. The filing or pendency of a grievance shall not delay or<br/>interfere with implementation of any District action during the procession<br/>thereof.</p>
<p>20.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may, from time<br/>to time, arise, affecting the welfare or working conditions of unit members.<br/>Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of procedure.</p>
<p>20.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL 1</p>
<p>20.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aggrieved employee may first discuss the grievance</p>
<p>with the immediate supervisor, either directly or through the<br/>Association’s designated Grievance Representative, with the objective of<br/>resolving the matter informally. Nothing contained herein shall be<br/>construed as limiting the right of any employee having a grievance to<br/>discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member of the<br/>administration and to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by<br/>the Association, provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent with<br/>the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall render a decision within five (5) days of the<br/>discussion.</p>
<p>20.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Section 20.4.1 is used and is unsatisfactory, the</p>
<p>aggrieved employee may file the grievance, in writing, with the immediate<br/>supervisor, either directly or through the Association's designated<br/>Grievance Representative, with the objective of resolving the matter.<br/>He/she must do so within ten (10) work days after the occurrence of the<br/>act or omission giving rise to the grievance by presenting such<br/>grievance, in writing, to the immediate supervisor. If neither the<br/>grievant nor the Association had actual or constructive knowledge of the<br/>occurrence of the grievable act or omission and could not, with the<br/>exercise of reasonable diligence, have known about it, then the ten day<br/>(10) day limit shall begin to run on the date upon which either the<br/>grievant or the Association could, with reasonable diligence, have known<br/>of the occurrence.</p>
<p>A written statement shall be a clear and concise statement of the<br/>grievance, including the specific provisions of the agreement alleged to<br/>have been violated, misapplied, or misinterpreted; the circumstance<br/>involved; the specific remedy sought. The written statement described<br/>herein shall be submitted on a grievance form provided by the District.</p>
<p>A copy of the grievance must be filed with the Association.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>The supervisor must render a written decision within five (5) days of the<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>20.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL 2</p>
<p>20.5.1 Appeal to the District: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the aggrieved employee is not</p>
<p>satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level 1, and/or if no<br/>written decision has been rendered within five (5) days after<br/>presentation of the grievance, the aggrieved employee may file the<br/>grievance, in writing, simultaneously with the Association and the<br/>District within ten (10) days after the written decision at Level 1.</p>
<p>20.5.2 Response by Superintendent or Designee: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ten (10) days</p>
<p>after receipt of the written grievance by the District, the District<br/>shall meet with the aggrieved employee and a representative of the<br/>Association in an effort to resolve the grievance. The District shall<br/>render a decision, in writing, within ten (10) days of this meeting.</p>
<p>20.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL 3</p>
<p>20.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved employee is not satisfied with the disposition of<br/>the grievance at Level 2, or if no written decision has been rendered<br/>within ten (10) days after the first meeting with the District, the<br/>aggrieved employee may request, in writing, that the Association submit<br/>the grievance to the Contract Commission. The Association shall notify<br/>the Superintendent, in writing, within fifteen (15)days after receipt of<br/>the request from the employee of its intention to proceed to the Contract<br/>Commission.</p>
<p>20.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of the Contract Commission:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Contract Commission</p>
<p>shall consist of three unit members appointed by the Association and<br/>three District members appointed by the Superintendent. The Commission<br/>members shall not be from the site where the alleged grievance took<br/>place. The Commission will meet within ten (10) days of the<br/>Association’s submission of the grievance to the Commission.</p>

<p>decision shall be in writing and shall set forth its findings of fact,<br/>reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Contract</p>
<p>Commission shall be without power or authority to make any<br/>recommendations which required the commission of an act prohibited by law<br/>or which is in violation of the terms of this Agreement. The Contract<br/>Commission shall render a decision within fifteen (15) days of the<br/>conclusion of final presentations by the District and the Association.</p>
<p>20.6.4 Response to Decision of the Contract Commission: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majority</p>
<p>decision of the Contract Commission shall be final and binding on the<br/>parties unless, after review of the decision by the Board of Trustees and<br/>CUTA's Executive Board, the District or the Association decides to<br/>proceed to arbitration.</p>
<p>In the event that the Contract Commission is unable to render a decision<br/>by a majority vote or if no written decision has been rendered within<br/>fifteen (15) days after submission to the Contract Commission, the Board<br/>of Trustees shall have an opportunity, at the next regularly scheduled<br/>Board meeting, to review the grievance if either party indicates that<br/>they wish to proceed to arbitration.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>20.7 LEVEL 4</p>
<p>20.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall notify the Superintendent, in writing,</p>
<p>within ten (10) days after the decision of the Contract Commission or the<br/>Board review, if it intends to proceed to binding arbitration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</p>
<p>Superintendent shall notify the Association within ten (10) days after<br/>the decision of the Contract Commission or the Board review, if the<br/>District intends to proceed to binding arbitration.</p>
<p>20.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECTION OF ARBITRATION PANEL</p>
<p>The arbitration shall be heard by a panel of three (3) arbitrators.</p>
<p>20.7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible, in any event no later than fifteen<br/>(15) days after the District receives the written notice of the<br/>Association’s desire to arbitrate, the parties shall each select an<br/>arbitrator.</p>
<p>20.7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third arbitrator shall be selected by the arbitrators<br/>appointed by the District and the Association within forty-five<br/>(45) days of the District's receipt of the Association's request to<br/>arbitrate.</p>
<p>20.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIMITATION UPON ARBITRATION PANEL</p>
<p>The arbitration panel shall have no power to alter, amend, change, add<br/>to, or subtract from any of the terms of this agreement, but shall<br/>determine only whether or not there has been a violation, misapplication,<br/>misinterpretation of this agreement in the respect alleged in the<br/>grievance. The decision of the arbitration panel shall be based solely<br/>upon the evidence and arguments presented to them by the respective<br/>parties in the presence of each other and upon arguments presented in<br/>briefs.</p>
<p>This agreement constitutes a contract between the parties which shall be<br/>interpreted and applied by the parties &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the arbitration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in</p>
<p>the same manner as any other contract &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the laws of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of</p>
<p>California. The function and purpose &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitration panel is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to</p>
<p>determine disputed interpretation of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually found&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>agreement or to determine disputed facts upon which the application of<br/>the agreement depends. The arbitration panel shall, therefore, not have<br/>authority, nor shall they consider it their function to decide any issue<br/>not submitted or to so interpret or apply the agreement as to change that<br/>which can fairly be said to have been the intent of the parties as<br/>determined by generally-accepted rules of contract construction. Past<br/>practice of the parties in interpreting or applying terms of this<br/>agreement may be considered relevant evidence. The arbitration panel<br/>shall not render any decision or award merely because in their opinion<br/>such decision or award is fair or equitable.</p>
<p>No decision rendered by the arbitration panel shall be retroactive beyond<br/>the ten-day period specified in Article 20.4.2 of the grievance procedure<br/>for the filing of a grievance. The arbitration panel shall have no power<br/>to render an award on any grievance occurring before or after the term of<br/>this agreement.</p>
<p>The arbitration panel may hear and determine only one grievance at a<br/>time, unless the District expressly agrees otherwise. However, both<br/>parties will, in good faith, endeavor to handle, in an expeditious and<br/>convenient manner, cases which involve the same or similar facts and<br/>issues.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>20.7.4 DECISION OF THE ARBITRATION PANEL</p>
<p>20.7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitration panel shall be made by a</p>
<p>majority vote. The majority decision shall be in writing and shall<br/>set forth the findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions only on<br/>the issues submitted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision shall be written&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the</p>
<p>arbitrators serving on the panel.</p>
<p>20.7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration panel shall be without power or authority<br/>to make any decision which requires the commission of an act<br/>prohibited by law or which is in violation of the terms of this<br/>Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitration panel is<br/>empowered to include any award for such financial reimbursement or<br/>other remedies as they judge to be proper within the scope of the<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>20.7.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and<br/>binding on the parties.</p>
<p>20.7.5 EXPENSES</p>
<p>All fees and expenses of the third arbitrator shall be shared equally by<br/>the parties. Each party shall bear the expense of the presentation of<br/>its own case and the expense of the arbitrator it has selected.</p>
<p>20.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAILURE TO MEET TIME LIMITS</p>
<p>Time limits hereunder may be lengthened or shortened in any particular case<br/>only by mutual written agreement. The parties will attempt, in good faith, to<br/>adjust time limit problems which occur above Level 1 as a result of the summer<br/>recess.</p>
<p>20.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE MEETINGS</p>
<p>Grievance meetings normally will be scheduled by the District so as not to<br/>conflict with classroom duties.</p>
<p>20.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
<p>In order to encourage a professional and harmonious disposition of unit<br/>members' complaints, it is agreed that from the time a grievance is filed until<br/>it is processed through arbitration, neither the grievant nor the Association<br/>nor the District shall make public either the grievance or evidence regarding<br/>the grievance.</p>
<p>20.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO REPRISALS</p>
<p>There shall be no reprisal against a unit member for filing a grievance or<br/>assisting a grievant in the above procedure.</p>
<p>20.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE FILES</p>
<p>The District's records dealing with the filing and processing of a grievance<br/>shall be maintained separately from the grievant<sup>1</sup>s personnel file.</p>

The parties further agree that the failure of any unit<br/>member to remain a member in good standing of the Association or to pay<br/>the equivalent of standard periodic dues, initiation fees, and general<br/>assessments during the term of the Agreement shall constitute persistent<br/>violation of and refusal to obey the school laws of California reasonable<br/>regulations prescribed for the government of the District by the<br/>governing board of the District and shall constitute cause for<br/>termination under Section 44932 (g) of the Education Code.</p>

In the event a unit member who holds conscientious<br/>objections pursuant to this paragraph, requests the Association to use<br/>the grievance procedure including arbitration on the unit member's<br/>behalf, the Association will charge the unit member for the reasonable<br/>costs of using such procedure.</p>
<p>21.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who chooses not to participate in payroll<br/>deduction of membership dues or service fees shall transmit such dues or<br/>fees to the Association, with the following payment:</p>

<p>25.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences shall be covered by the job-share partner (with payment<br/>at the daily or proportionate substitute rate) or by a District-provided<br/>substitute. Trading of workdays by job-share partners shall be at the<br/>discretion of the principal or designee.</p>
<p>25.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All job-sharing participants will attend all staff meetings, open<br/>houses, parent conferences, inservice training, and complete all other<br/>professional obligations at the discretion of the principal/designee or<br/>in accordance with the approved job-share proposal.</p>
<p>25.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RETURN TO FULL-TIME POSITION(S)</p>
<p>25.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All job-share assignments shall be for a term of one (1) year with<br/>a waiver by the affected unit members of any right to return to full time<br/>service within that year except as provided below.</p>
<p>25.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particular job-share assignment is determined by the District<br/>to be ineffective during the course of the school year, the District may<br/>terminate the job-share assignment immediately and return the unit member<br/>to either his/her prior level of FTE or continue at the job-share FTE<br/>level of a regular assignment within the same classification at the<br/>District’s discretion.</p>
<p>25.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that one (1) job-sharing unit member is unable to<br/>complete the assignment due to illness or other unforeseen circumstance,<br/>and in the further event that another qualified job-sharing unit member<br/>satisfactory to the District is unavailable to assume the job-share<br/>assignment, the District may terminate the job-share assignment and<br/>return the remaining job-share unit member to full-time service.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 26</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONAL STANDARDS</p>
<p>26.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the District that all instruction shall be fair,<br/>accurate, thorough, objective, and appropriate to the District<br/>curriculum and applicable law. It is also the policy of the District<br/>that instruction be appropriate to the diverse community needs and the<br/>needs and values of our varied cultures and heritages. Instructional<br/>standards are essential to the fulfillment of this policy, and the<br/>District acknowledges the fundamental need to protect unit members from<br/>any contractual violation or unlawful censorship or unlawful restraint<br/>which might interfere with the unit member's obligation to pursue<br/>academic excellence in the performance of their teaching functions.</p>
<p>26.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may introduce lawful political, religious, or other<br/>material, provided it adheres to the state and District adopted<br/>curriculum and is relevant and appropriate to grade level and course<br/>content.</p>
<p>26.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member will make every effort to offer differing<br/>points of view. Each teacher shall promote an atmosphere in the<br/>classroom which is conducive to free and open inquiry.</p>
<p>26.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing teaching functions, unit members may express various<br/>and differing opinions on all matters relevant to the course content, in<br/>an objective manner. A unit member, however, shall not utilize his/her<br/>position to indoctrinate students with his/her own personal, political,<br/>and/or religious views.</p>

<p>APPENDIX E<br/>(Page 2 of 2)</p>
<p>FAMILY CARE AND MEDICAL LEAVE</p>
<p>A unit member may request Family Care and Medical Leave for up to 12 workweeks<br/>for one of the following reasons, according to conditions stated in Article<br/>16.9.1:</p>
<p>1.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the birth of a child of the employee;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the placement of a child with the employee for the employee's<br/>adoption or foster care of the child;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to care for an employee's child, parent, or spouse who has a<br/>serious health condition;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the employee's own serious health condition that makes the<br/>employee unable to perform the functions of the position held by the<br/>employee, except for leave taken for disability on account of pregnancy,<br/>childbirth, or related medical conditions.</p>
<p>An employee's family care and medical leave shall not exceed 12 workweeks<br/>during any 12-month period. This 12-month period shall coincide with the<br/>fiscal (school year) year.</p>
<p>&quot;Child&quot; means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal<br/>ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis as long as the child is<br/>under 18 years of age or an adult dependant child.</p>
<p>&quot;Parent&quot; means a biological, foster, or adoptive parent, a step-parent, or a<br/>legal guardian.</p>
<p>&quot;Serious health conditions&quot; means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical<br/>mental condition that involves either inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or<br/>residential health care facility, or continuing treatment or supervision by a<br/>health care provider.</p>
<p>An employee who requests leave to care for a child, a spouse, or a parent who<br/>has a serious health condition may be required by the District to submit a<br/>certificate from the health care &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verifying the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;date on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the</p>
<p>serious health condition commenced, the probable duration of the condition, an<br/>estimate of the amount of time the health care provider believes the employee<br/>needs to care for the individual requiring the care, and a statement that the<br/>affected individual's condition warrants the participation of a family member<br/>to provide care. If additional leave is needed after the time estimated by the<br/>health care provider expires, the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall provide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;re-certification in</p>
<p>the same manner specified above.</p>
<p>If an employee's need for family care and medical leave is foreseeable,<br/>reasonable advance notice shall be given. Where the need for family care and<br/>medical leave is known more than 30 days before the leave is to begin, the<br/>employee must provide 30 days written notice to the Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Personnel Services. Where the need &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes known&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 days</p>
<p>before the leave is to begin, where &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the employee is to give&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five (5)</p>
<p>APPENDIX F<br/>(Page 1 of 2)</p>
<p>days' written notice. When leave is needed for a planned medical treatment or<br/>supervision, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the<br/>treatment or supervision to avoid disruption of District operations. This<br/>scheduling shall be subject to the health care provider's approval.</p>
<p>The District requires an employee to use any paid accrued time off, other than<br/>accrued sick leave, during the family care and medical leave. The District<br/>requires the employee to use any accrued sick leave that employee is otherwise<br/>eligible to take during family care and medical leave for the employee's own<br/>serious health condition.</p>
<p>Leave taken for worker's compensation or short-term disability which meets the<br/>state or federal requirements relating to a serious health condition will run<br/>concurrently with family care and medical leave.</p>
<p>All unpaid leave available to employees under this Article will be substituted<br/>by the District to be taken by the employee concurrently with the employee's<br/>family care and medical leave.</p>
<p>Leave taken for disability on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related<br/>medical condition shall be taken pursuant to Government Code Section 12945 and<br/>shall be taken in addition to family care and medical leave for a period not to<br/>exceed four months. During the employee's pregnancy disability leave, such<br/>employee may use any accrued vacation, sick time or other paid leave.</p>
<p>While an employee is on family care and medical leave, the District shall<br/>maintain and pay for the employee's health coverage at the same level and under<br/>the same conditions under which the District would have provided health<br/>coverage if the employee had continued working rather than taken a leave. This<br/>obligation to make employee contributions commences on the date leave first<br/>begins and continues up to a maximum of 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. The<br/>District may recover the District's contribution to the employee's health<br/>coverage if the employee fails to return from leave for reasons other than the<br/>continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that otherwise<br/>entitles the employee to take family care, and medical leave or for other<br/>circumstances beyond the employee's control.</p>
<p>When both parents are employed by the District, &quot;child rearing&quot; leave connected<br/>with the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child shall cumulatively be no<br/>greater than 12 workweeks.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the family care and medical leave, the employee shall be<br/>returned to the same position classification held by the employee and at the<br/>same geographically approximate work site the employee worked at prior to the<br/>commencement of the leave. In some instances, reinstatement may be denied to<br/>employees who are among the 10 percent of the highest paid employees working<br/>for the District.</p>
