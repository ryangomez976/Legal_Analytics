<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of the powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities by the<br/>District, the adoption of policies, rules, regulations and practices in furtherance<br/>thereof, and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith, shall be<br/>limited only by the specific and express terms of this agreement, and then only to<br/>the extent such specific and express terms are in conformance with law.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the District retains all of its powers and authority to<br/>direct, manage and control to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an emergency situation caused by natural disaster (e.g., flood, fire,<br/>earthquake), the District Administration will have the right to immediately re-open<br/>and/or suspend, for the duration of the emergency, any portion of the Agreement<br/>directly related to the nature of the situation.</p>

<p>ARTICLE V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAGES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Schedule</p>
<p>The salary schedule for 2012/13 will revert back to the 2010/11 salary schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Retirement Option</p>
<p>1. Reduced Workload Program: Part-time employment with full-time<br/>retirement credit and health benefits as if full-time while on the Reduced<br/>Workload Program. Reduced workload to no less than .5 FTE. Elementary<br/>unit members, with the exception of Special Education teachers who are<br/>working at an elementary site, have to work either .6 or .5.</p>
<p>To be eligible the employee must meet the eligibility rules of Education<br/>Code 44922: must be at least age 55 by their first workday of 2012/13, must<br/>have a minimum of 10 years retirement service credit, and have a minimum<br/>of 5 consecutive years of full-time employment immediately preceding the<br/>reduction in workload, with no break in service during those years; approved<br/>leaves of absences do not constitute a break in service.</p>
<p>Eligible individuals must submit a letter of intent to participate in the<br/>Reduced Workload Program to the Human Resources Office by April 13,<br/>2012.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>2. Supplemental Retirement Plan (SRP):</p>
<p>A one-time payment through an IRS qualified plan that will give employees<br/>several options as to how the amount may be paid to them.</p>
<p>The amount of the SRP will be calculated as the difference between the<br/>unit member’s current annual salary, including advanced degrees, less<br/>$50,182 (which represents the average anticipated annual replacement<br/>cost of a unit member); the difference will be increased by 13.25% (salary<br/>related fringe benefits) to determine the SRP amount.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$73,858</p>
<p>-$50.182<br/>$23,676<br/>+ 13.25%<br/>$26,813</p>
<p>current annual salary at full-time FTE<br/>anticipated replacement cost</p>
<p>salary related fringe benefits<br/>SRP amount (pro-rated if less than full¬<br/>time)</p>
<p>To acknowledge those employees who have been in the Petaluma City<br/>School District for more than 30 years, an additional $1,000 for every year<br/>of service over 30 years will be added to their SRP.</p>
<p>The SRP will be pro-rated for less than full-time work and for leaves of<br/>absences.</p>
<p>Employees who are currently under the Reduced Workload Program may<br/>continue on that Program or may elect the SRP at the pro-rated percentage<br/>of FTE that the unit member is currently working.</p>
<p>To participate in the SRP the unit member must submit their irrevocable<br/>letter of resignation, effective at the completion of the 2011/2012 school<br/>year, to Human Resources no later than April 13, 2012.</p>
<p>Parity Salary Adjustment</p>
<p>A study and calculation of parity will be taken on May 10 of each year, with five<br/>surrounding districts (Cotati-Rohnert Park, Novato, Santa Rosa, Sonoma Valley,<br/>and Windsor). If the parity study shows that the Petaluma salary is not at or above</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile of the existing comparison group salary schedules at column I<br/>step 1, maximum at 10 years and maximum, an adjustment will be made to raise<br/>the Petaluma salary to the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile retroactive to July 1<sup>st</sup> of that school year.<br/>The parity study will add to the Petaluma salary schedule the agreed amount<br/>minus approximately .19% for the “excess cost of a masters adjustment”.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary schedule for Athletic Special Assignments shall be as shown on<br/>attached EXHIBIT &quot;C&quot;.</p>
<p>The salary schedule for Non-Athletic Special Assignments shall be as shown on<br/>attached EXHIBIT &quot;D&quot;.</p>
<p>The Federation and the District agree that all extra duty jobs performed by a<br/>certificated employee fall under collective bargaining. Therefore, regardless of the<br/>actual source of monies used to compensate for extra duty assignments, the rate<br/>of pay must be negotiated. There exists in the contract two categories of extra<br/>duty service, Athletic and Non-Athletic. Any extra duty assignment must come to<br/>the bargaining table for negotiations.</p>
<p>The joint committee will continue their study of the Non-Athletic Special<br/>Assignment pay.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule of School Psychologist Increments</p>
<p>School Psychologists shall be placed on the salary schedule (EXHIBIT &quot;B&quot;)<br/>according to their training and experience and shall receive the following<br/>increments in addition to their base salary:</p>
<p>Step I Step II Step III Step IV StepV<br/>1.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.07</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors</p>
<p>All counselors employed by the Petaluma School Districts shall be placed upon<br/>the salary schedule (EXHIBIT &quot;B&quot;) in accordance with their respective training<br/>and experience. Because of their extended work year, consisting of ten (10)<br/>additional days, they shall receive additional compensation computed against<br/>their basic salary placement (see EXHIBIT &quot;B&quot; for definition of basic salary<br/>placement). The annual salary for a counselor with this extended work year shall<br/>be computed as follows:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic salary placement x [number of days worked/standard work year]</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior High Schools will receive funding for up to an extra ten days of<br/>counselor time. The extra workdays are flexible and are to be mutually<br/>agreed upon by the Counselors and Administration. Junior High Counselors<br/>shall receive additional compensation computed at their base salary per diem<br/>rate. Junior High Counselors must submit a supplemental pay claim for any<br/>extra days worked.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>• Lead Counselors shall have an extended work year consisting of sixteen (16)<br/>additional workdays beyond the normal counselor work year. Lead<br/>Counselors shall receive additional compensation computed against their<br/>basic salary placement for the additional normal counselor and Lead<br/>Counselor workdays. Lead Counselors shall have scheduled workdays in<br/>each month from July 1 through June 30 and will receive their salary in twelve<br/>(12) payments. Lead Counselors shall fulfill the essential duties and<br/>responsibilities defined in the job description for Lead Counselor.</p>
<p>All counselors will prepare for Administration a work year calendar in advance<br/>that includes all work days for the following year.</p>
<p>If the State greatly decreases or eliminates the supplemental counseling funds, the<br/>District and PFT agree to negotiate the Lead Counseling position and counselor<br/>caseloads.</p>
<p>G. Extended Year Unit Members</p>
<p>Extended year unit Members may be assigned to a position when the program<br/>requires year-round supervision of students and attendance at student program<br/>activities, not scheduled by the school district and occurring outside of the<br/>regular school work days. These days may be on weekends, during winter or<br/>spring breaks, and/or during the summer.</p>
<p>Extended year unit members must maintain and submit a work calendar to<br/>Human Resources showing the extra days worked and the nature of the<br/>activities performed.</p>
<p>Extra compensation at the rate of 20% of the base pay shall be granted for the<br/>additional work. Workdays shall total 120% of the normal workdays for full-time<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>Annual evaluation of this extra assignment, by a joint PFT-District committee of<br/>four, will occur by the end of January of each year and will be based on the<br/>documentation provided by the unit member and the recommendation of the site<br/>principal or principal’s designee. The joint committee of four will bring the<br/>recommendation for authorization to continue to the bargaining table for<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>H. National Board Certification</p>
<p>Unit members who achieve National Board Certification, based on requirements<br/>set out by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, will be justly<br/>compensated by a stipend of $1,098 annually.</p>

Unit Members renewing their certification will be eligible for five<br/>days of school business leave to prepare the required portfolio.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>If the unit member does not renew their certification, the stipend for this will be</p>
<p>eliminated effective the first of the month following the expiration of the</p>
<p>certification.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Schedule Placement</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original placement on the salary schedule (EXHIBIT &quot;B&quot;) shall be made<br/>by the District on the basis of official transcripts verifying semester<br/>graduate units (or quarter unit equivalent) from accredited colleges or<br/>universities and certification of experience for purposes of evaluation<br/>submitted to the District at the time of employment.</p>

<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>The work year for 2012/13 will revert back to the 2010/11 work year. For classroom unit<br/>members this shall consist of 177 working days, of which 175 shall be regular classroom<br/>teaching days.</p>
<p>A. The work year for classroom unit members covered by this Agreement shall<br/>consist of 177 working days, of which 175 shall be regular classroom teaching<br/>days. Of the 177 days, two days shall be scheduled unit member workdays at the<br/>beginning of the school year for elementary unit members, and one day shall be<br/>scheduled unit member workday at the beginning of the school year for the<br/>secondary unit members. One day shall be scheduled during the school year as a<br/>unit member workday for secondary unit members.</p>
<p>The Federation and the District will continue the process of shared decision¬<br/>making regarding scheduling of non-teaching workdays through the K-12<br/>Curriculum and Staff Development Committees.</p>
<p>Unit members who work less than full-time are an integral part of the school staff<br/>and need to participate in staff meetings and other professional responsibilities,<br/>consistent with the FTE that they are contracted for, by mutual agreement with<br/>their site administrator.</p>
<p>In the interest of shared decision-making and in the best interests of students,<br/>unit members who choose to teach zero hour are expected to fulfill professional<br/>responsibilities of attending staff meetings, department meetings, and other<br/>meetings required of all unit members, such as lEPs and parent conferences by<br/>mutual agreement with their site administrator.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are new to the Petaluma School District(s) shall have<br/>one additional orientation day at the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities planned for orientation days and inservice days shall be at the<br/>discretion of the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time Independent Study Unit Members have an eight (8) hour work day.</p>
<p>B. Secondary Extra-Curricular Supervision</p>
<p>As part of professional obligations, secondary certificated employees shall attend<br/>or sponsor extra-curricular activities. After participating in a site-based shared<br/>decision-making process, the employee shall select the activities the employee<br/>will take part in for the year, from the following list:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sponsorship of an ongoing class; OR</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation/chaperone at graduation ceremonies, honor award assemblies,<br/>plays, concerts, dances, or athletic events, or sponsorship of an ongoing club<br/>(the unit member and a site administrator will agree on the number of<br/>required activities that the club supervision will represent). No certificated<br/>employee shall be expected to attend more than three such activities per<br/>year. As attendees, unit members shall not be required to perform security<br/>tasks, but will in a professional manner respond to situations involving the<br/>health and safety of those in attendance. The number of secondary<br/>certificated employees needed at any particular event will be determined by<br/>the site administration.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administrators will list the various events where unit members’<br/>professional attendance is required and the number of unit members required<br/>at each. Certificated employees shall participate in a process where they can<br/>sign up, in an equitable fashion, for their required number of supervision<br/>activities.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>• If there are requirements for supervision or attendance at events that exceed<br/>the total number of remaining attendance activities, these positions can be<br/>offered as paid positions at the negotiated rates.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Extra-Curricular Responsibilities</p>
<p>As part of professional obligations, elementary teachers will serve in site and<br/>district capacities. After participating in a site-based decision-making process, the<br/>teachers shall volunteer to serve in committees/tasks/opportunities in an equitable<br/>fashion. The site administrator may assign a teacher to serve in a site and/or<br/>district capacity if their volunteer assignments do not represent an equitable share<br/>of professional responsibility.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit, other than classroom unit members, may have a<br/>lengthened work year as indicated in Article V.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendar Committee</p>
<p>The District will work with the Federation, through a consensus model of shared<br/>decision-making on the calendar beginning in September of each year, through<br/>the Calendar Committee.</p>
<p>The Calendar Committee consists of one Federation representative from each<br/>an elementary, junior high, and high school, as well as two representatives from<br/>CSEA, one from Confidential, one from PLA, one small feeder district<br/>representative, and a representative from the District Office appointed by the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>If consensus is not reached by February 1<sup>st</sup> the District will change to a<br/>consultation shared decision-making model and will publish the calendar as a<br/>business necessity.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Scheduling Methods</p>
<p>A PFT and District sub-committee will utilize the data gathered from the<br/>elementary sites regarding scheduling methods used in regards to assigning staff<br/>duties for general school functions and will recommend agreed upon policies.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weekly teaching load in the junior and senior high schools for<br/>classroom unit members shall be twenty-five (25) teaching periods or<br/>equivalent (such as modular or alternative schedule) and five (5)<br/>preparation periods. Assignment to a supervised study period shall be<br/>considered a teaching period. Unit members who only supervise in an In-<br/>House Suspension class shall not be entitled to a preparation period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article XX, Shared Decision-Making, will be utilized at each site, with the<br/>goal of limiting unit members' subjects taught to three (3), unless, due to<br/>unusual circumstances, a unit member requests a waiver. This includes</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>teaching different courses within a single content area with the exception of<br/>electives and SDAIE classes.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every member of the bargaining unit shall be entitled to no less than a 30-minute</p>
<p>duty-free lunch period every workday. A unit member may choose to waive this</p>
<p>entitlement.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Preparation Time</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viable options for providing preparation time should be developed at<br/>each school site through a shared decision-making process and within<br/>existing financial parameters. The District will share the appropriate<br/>sections of each elementary school’s budget with the other elementary<br/>schools, to assist them in determining the best use of their available<br/>resources.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a credentialed resource unit member is instructing students, the<br/>classroom unit member may utilize the time for preparation and planning of<br/>curriculum materials except in cases in which the classroom unit member<br/>and the resource unit member are integrating their instruction.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-committee formed in the 2009/10 school year will continue to<br/>explore methods of providing elementary prep time.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job Sharing in Elementary Schools</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation and District Administration agree that job flexibility should<br/>be an option for Federation members. Therefore, the opportunity for<br/>elementary unit members to share a job assignment should be available at<br/>every site.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation and District Administration further agree to the setting of<br/>criteria and the standard job-share agreement checklist as listed below that<br/>will be used by the principal to determine the viability of a job-share team.<br/>In any case, the final decision as to whether or not a job-share will be<br/>allowed, based on the district-wide criteria, will remain with the principal.</p>
<p>The principal will also have the right and responsibility to determine, based<br/>on the district-wide criteria, if a job-share team should continue each<br/>successive year.</p>
<p>Elementary Job-Sharing Criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-share participants must be compatible in terms of instructional<br/>strategies, classroom management, and educational philosophy. This must<br/>be clearly stated in a detailed, written proposal that will be presented to the<br/>principal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone wishing to propose a job-share must make their written proposal no<br/>later than April 1st.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-share eligibility will be based on each partner having Permanent<br/>contract status or having passed through the Hiring Protocol and completed<br/>at least one year of service in the district.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A job-share commitment must be for at least 40%.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff(s) involved will be informed before the job-share has been<br/>approved.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should one participant choose not to continue the partnership, the<br/>partnership is dissolved and both partners revert to their previous status.<br/>Should this occur, the partner(s) will inform each other and the principal no<br/>later than April 1 st.</p>
<p>The partner who was originally assigned to the school where the<br/>partnership has occurred would retain the position at that school; the other<br/>partner would be assigned to a position for which they are credentialed and<br/>qualified.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each job-share proposal/agreement will be evaluated by the partners and<br/>the principal prior to May 1st.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to annual satisfactory evaluation of the job-share<br/>proposal/agreement and written requests from unit members to continue<br/>the job-share for the ensuing year, the partnership may continue. A non-<br/>Reduced Workload Program job-share may continue up to a maximum of<br/>five years.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Federation and District Administration agree that no unit member<br/>will be required to work more than the percentage of days required by their<br/>contract, the following responsibilities must be addressed in the<br/>proposal/agreement:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekly staff meetings</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortened Wednesdays for staff development</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent conferences (fall and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spring)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff development days</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to School</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open House</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two unit member work days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the fall</p>
<p>The Federation and District Administration will assist the parties to reach an<br/>agreement that is both educationally sound and equitable.</p>
<p>Job-Share Agreement Checklist:</p>
<p>1. Written statement that covers educational philosophy, instructional<br/>strategies and classroom management.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of the job-share and a description of how it would work.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plan to address attendance at staff meetings, staff development activities,<br/>parent conferences, Back to School Night, Open House and two unit<br/>member work days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strengths that each partner brings to the partnership.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plan to assess the effectiveness of the job-share.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District and the Federation that other details regarding hours<br/>of employment continue to be handled in the professional manner currently<br/>governed by District policy. The District states that it has no intent to alter policies<br/>regarding hours of employment. The Federation, in turn, states that these policies<br/>are in no sense incorporated as part of this Agreement. However, if at any time<br/>during the life of this Agreement the District should find it necessary to alter or<br/>amend policies respecting hours of employment, the Federation will be given thirty<br/>(30) days' prior notice for the purpose of consultation.</p>
<p>Should the Federation consider the consultation process to have been<br/>unsuccessful respecting the proposed change in District policy, the Federation<br/>may request reopened negotiations on this single matter within thirty (30) days of<br/>the effective date of the altered District policy.</p>
<p>These negotiations shall take place during the next scheduled reopener period or<br/>within ninety (90) calendar days, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I DEI A Legislation Impact</p>
<p>A committee will meet four times in 2011/12 to review the perceived increased<br/>load on special education unit members as a result of IDEIA legislation. The<br/>review will also include methods currently in place on how regular education unit<br/>members fulfill the requirements of their presence and involvement in lEPs and<br/>will report back their recommendations to the Negotiations team. The District<br/>and the Federation need to come to agreement on utilizing the findings of the<br/>IDEIA committee to support the concepts listed in Article XI section G, which<br/>describes the class size subcommittee.</p>
<p>The subcommittee will meet to identify typical accommodations appropriate to<br/>curriculum and classroom environment of the Petaluma School District and submit<br/>proposals to both District and PFT negotiators.</p>
<p>The subcommittee will recommend a process to insure equitable non classroom<br/>responsibility and submit proposals to both District and PFT negotiators.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>HEALTH AND WELFARE</p>
<p>A. Health. Dental, and Vision Insurance</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of Health and Welfare benefits will be considered as part of the<br/>total compensation package to be negotiated with the Federation.</p>

<p>The District will pick up the 12% increase to Delta Dental and will establish<br/>the new rate of $144.50 per month as a Dental cap for full time unit<br/>members effective October 1,2012.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unit members who select the Kaiser or Blue Shield health plans,<br/>the District will pay up to $1,008.84 per month.</p>

Any unit member in a continuing employment<br/>relationship with the District shall receive the benefit of District health and<br/>welfare payment, if such has been a part of the current Agreement, in<br/>anticipation of his/her service commencing with the ensuing educational<br/>year. Such unit member, who because of a continuing employment<br/>relationship with the District, has received benefit of District premium<br/>payments during the summer months and subsequently resigns, or<br/>otherwise vacates his/her position with the District, shall be financially liable<br/>to repay the District for any and all premium benefit payments made during<br/>the summer period. This financial responsibility shall be a prorata<br/>computation based upon the amount of time served by the unit member<br/>during the new school year. This repayment obligation would not affect<br/>those employees who serve more than one semester during the ensuing<br/>school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members who work less than full time</p>
<p>The District shall pay an amount that bears the same ratio to the health plan<br/>cap per month for health insurance as the average amount of time worked<br/>bears to the time normally worked by a full-time unit member toward the<br/>premiums of those regular part-time unit members who work 50% or more<br/>who elect to accept a District-selected plan and who authorize deductions of<br/>any additional premiums from their salaries.</p>
<p>The District shall pay an amount that bears the same ratio to the total<br/>insurance premiums per month for dental and vision insurance as the<br/>average amount of time worked bears to the time normally worked by a full¬<br/>time unit member toward the premiums of those regular part-time unit<br/>members who elect to accept the District-selected plans and who authorize<br/>deductions of any additional premiums from their salaries.</p>
<p>Unit members working ten or more months shall have the same health,<br/>dental, and vision premiums paid by the District as twelve-month unit<br/>members working the same number of hours per week. Authorized<br/>deductions shall be withheld by the District from monthly salary payments.</p>
<p>Effective May 1, 2007, unit members who work less than 50% are not<br/>eligible to participate in a health plan, however they can choose to<br/>participate in the dental or vision plans. Unit members working less than<br/>50% who currently participate in a health plan will be grandfathered in and<br/>can continue to be covered. If they elect not to continue to participate in the<br/>future they will not be eligible without meeting the 50% requirement.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2008, unit members who work full time are required to<br/>participate in a health plan; participation in the dental and vision plans is<br/>optional and not a requirement.</p>
<p>B. Life Insurance</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have completed six months of continuous service, and<br/>who work a minimum of .75 FTE (30 hours per week) shall be eligible for<br/>the District's approved Life Insurance Program on the first calendar day of<br/>the calendar month following the completion of the six-month period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall pay the full premium toward the $37,000 life insurance<br/>policy for the term of this Agreement for unit members working a minimum<br/>average of 30 hours per week for 75 percent of the school year and who<br/>elect to accept the District-approved program.</p>

Unit<br/>members paying their own premiums must remit monies to the District at<br/>least one month prior to the monthly premium due date.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any benefits that are available to married employees will be accorded to<br/>employees who are duly registered as domestic partners with the City of<br/>Petaluma or with the State of California.</p>

<p>LEAVES</p>
<p>A. Leaves - General</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions regarding the method of application for processing, and<br/>consideration of, all manner of leaves shall remain the express<br/>responsibility of the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All absences from regularly assigned duties shall be approved by the Board<br/>of Education or the Superintendent or his/her designee. All absences shall<br/>be approved in advance, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in verifiable extreme emergencies which preclude communication<br/>with the District, absences taken without approval shall be considered as<br/>absences without leave. Employees taking absences without leave shall be<br/>subject to disciplinary action and loss of pay. Unauthorized absences of<br/>three or more consecutive days shall be considered as abandonment of the<br/>employment and the employee shall be considered to have resigned his/her<br/>position in the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for extension of leave, or notification regarding the intent to return<br/>from leave, shall be made to the District in writing, and receive approval by<br/>February 1 (November 1 for fall semester leaves); otherwise the employee<br/>will be presumed to have resigned his/her position. The unit member on<br/>leave shall receive notification by the District in writing no less than thirty<br/>(30) days prior to the respective deadlines.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is tenured in the District may be granted a two-year<br/>leave of absence for the purpose of serving with the Peace Corps or Vista.<br/>The District may grant a one-year leave of absence for exchange teaching.<br/>These leaves shall be without pay or benefit of any type or form except as<br/>otherwise provided in this section.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members on approved leave not exceeding two years shall retain<br/>seniority rights as pertaining to job security.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the responsibility of the unit member to have a current and<br/>correct address on file with the District Human Resources Office at all<br/>times. Further, this address of record may be used for all legal and formal<br/>notification purposes.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of any absence which is based upon illness, injury, quarantine,<br/>etc., the District Administration may require verification from a physician of<br/>the fitness of the employee to return to service. Normally, the verification<br/>provided in Section B. 4., if requested, shall suffice for this purpose.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>Sick Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members in active service (not on leave) shall be permitted sick leave<br/>for personal illness, injury, or quarantine on the following basis:</p>
<p>Ten-month unit members &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 days</p>
<p>Twelve-month unit members &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 days</p>
<p>Full use of it may be made any time during the year. If a first-year unit<br/>member should leave the employ of the District before the end of the year,<br/>any monies drawn from sick leave in excess of the rate of one day per<br/>month shall be refunded to the District.</p>
<p>Sick leave may be used for illness of the employee’s child, parent or<br/>spouse, up to the amount of sick leave that would be accrued during six<br/>months.</p>
<p>Partial day leaves of Certificated Bargaining Unit Members at schools with a<br/>block schedule, will have the leaves recorded in hours based on the<br/>information provided in their request for substitute on the Sub Finder. To<br/>the extent determinable by Payroll Clerks, the leaves will be two hours of<br/>leave per block. Leaves during a unit member’s Prep Period will be<br/>counted the same as any other period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon employment by the Petaluma (Elementary) or Petaluma High School<br/>District, any unit member who has been an employee of another school<br/>district within the State in a position requiring certification qualifications<br/>during the preceding school year shall be allowed to transfer to this district<br/>the total amount of sick leave to which he/she was entitled in his/her<br/>previous district.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unused portion of sick leave shall be cumulative without limit.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is absent on account of illness, injury, or quarantine<br/>may be required to sign on a form provided, a statement of the general<br/>nature of the illness, injury, or quarantine. If the absence is of a prolonged<br/>nature, or if the District feels there is a pattern or an apparent abuse of sick<br/>leave, the District may require that the unit member's health advisor<br/>(physician or other practitioner) certify the unit member's absence is or was<br/>due to illness, injury or quarantine, or the District may, at its own expense,<br/>require verification of the illness, injury, or quarantine by a physician of its<br/>choice.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is absent on account of illness or accident for a period<br/>of five school months or less, the amount deducted from the salary due<br/>him/her for any month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the<br/>amount actually paid a substitute employee employed to fill his/her position<br/>during his/her absence, or the amount which would have been deducted<br/>had a substitute been obtained. Unit members who have exhausted all<br/>accumulated sick leave and sick leave due under Section B (1) and who are</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>absent on account of illness for a period of more than five school months<br/>after said exhaustion of sick leave shall be deemed to be on sick leave<br/>without pay until such leave is terminated in accordance with procedures<br/>prescribed by law.</p>
<p>C. Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated sick leave may be used for absences created by personal<br/>necessity, not to exceed ten (10) days in any school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that the personal necessity leave is for instances of<br/>personal or professional need, and that the District Administration respects<br/>the integrity and professionalism of the members of the teaching staff.<br/>Therefore, the District Administration will not require a stated reason for<br/>personal necessity leave for any six (6) of the ten (10) days of allowed<br/>personal necessity leave. If more than six (6) days of personal necessity<br/>leave is used, a stated reason must be supplied for any of the remaining<br/>four (4) days. Personal necessity leave in excess of four (4) consecutive<br/>days will require a stated reason.</p>
<p>In those instances when a stated reason for personal necessity leave is<br/>required, and is denied by the supervisor, the denial will be forwarded to the<br/>Human Resources Administrator. If the Human Resources Administrator<br/>concurs with the denial they will consult with the Federation’s President.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may use personal necessity leave to comply with a subpoena<br/>or other court order to appear as a witness, including but not limited to<br/>cases in which the employee is a victim of a crime. School related court<br/>orders or subpoenas would be considered school business leave.</p>
<p>Employees may use personal necessity leave to obtain or attempt to<br/>obtain a temporary restraining order, restraining order or other injunctive<br/>relief to help ensure the health, safety or welfare of the employee or<br/>his/her child when the employee is a victim of domestic violence.</p>
<p>Prior to taking time off for a court appearance, an employee shall give<br/>reasonable notice to their supervisor unless an unscheduled or<br/>emergency court appearance is required for the health, safety or welfare<br/>of an employee who is a domestic violence victim or his/her child. When<br/>an unscheduled or emergency court appearance is required, the<br/>employee shall provide, within a reasonable time after the appearance,<br/>evidence from the court or prosecuting attorney that he/she has appeared<br/>in court.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in emergency situations, employees who intend to take personal<br/>necessity leave shall notify the building principal or immediate supervisor in<br/>writing no later than noon on the previous school day. The use of the<br/>District &quot;substitute line&quot; does not take the place of such prior written request.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>D. Emergency Leave</p>
<p>1. When, despite the best efforts of a unit member to report to work, it<br/>proves to be impossible due to a disaster, and when the area the unit<br/>member would have had to travel is subsequently declared a disaster<br/>area by the Governor, such as the storm of January 4, 1982, the unit<br/>member may apply for emergency leave.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be eligible to return when she presents a doctor's<br/>certificate indicating that she is able to perform her work satisfactorily for the<br/>District. A unit member returning from pregnancy disability leave shall<br/>resume her duties on a regular basis at the same position held prior to<br/>childbirth.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are not on leave and are in the current employ of the<br/>District are entitled to use personal illness and injury leave (Section B) for<br/>disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth,<br/>and recovery therefrom on the same terms and conditions governing leaves<br/>of absence from other illness or medical disability.

The length of such<br/>disability leave, including the date on which the leave shall commence and<br/>the date on which the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the<br/>unit member and the unit member's physician; however, the District may<br/>require a verification of the extent of disability through a physical<br/>examination of the unit member, at District expense, by a physician<br/>appointed by the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member’s sick leave has been exhausted they are entitled to<br/>differential pay.

<p>J. Maternity Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members employed by the District may be granted a leave for<br/>maternity reasons. Maternity leave allows bonding time with a new child<br/>and shall begin after a unit member has been released from pregnancy<br/>disability leave. Maternity leave and sick leave are separate and distinct.<br/>Maternity leave is not to be considered as part of sick leave or pregnancy<br/>disability leave.

<p>a. Effective July 1, 2010, during the first 20 regular, consecutive work<br/>days of maternity leave, (should the employee choose to take all or<br/>part of the maternity leave), the employee will receive the<br/>difference between her regular salary and the substitute’s salary, or</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>the salary a substitute would have received, and shall continue to<br/>receive health and welfare benefits. No unit member will receive<br/>both regular and differential pay.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the year in which maternity leave commences, a unit<br/>member may request a personal reasons leave, without pay, up to<br/>an additional year.

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence due to illness or injury resulting from pregnancy and/or<br/>childbirth shall be covered by pregnancy disability leave in<br/>accordance with the Education Code.</p>
<p>3. Personal reasons leave following maternity leave shall not constitute a<br/>break in service for tenure purposes. Time spent on maternity leave shall<br/>not count in acquiring tenure unless the employee is on duty a minimum of<br/>75 per cent of the days in which school is in session during the school year<br/>in which the leave is taken.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental/Adoptive Leave</p>

Such</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>leave would commence on the first day of absence and when the sixty (60)<br/>days will overlap into the next fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to<br/>only the unused amount remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the<br/>illness or injury occurred for the same illness or injury. Such leave shall not<br/>be accumulative from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members have the right to use their own health care provider for<br/>treatment (physician or chiropractor) so long as the unit member has placed<br/>the name of his/her personal physician or other health provider on file with<br/>the employer.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require an examination of the unit member, at District<br/>expense, by a physician designated by the District to assist in determining<br/>the length of time during which the employee will be temporarily unable to<br/>perform assigned duties and the degree to which a disability is attributable<br/>to the injury involved.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any days of absence from duty as a result of the same industrial<br/>accident, the unit member shall endorse to the District any wage loss<br/>benefit check from RESIG which would make the total compensation from<br/>both sources exceed 100 percent of the amount the unit member would<br/>have received as salary for his/her primary assignment had there been no<br/>industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member fails to endorse to the District any wage disability<br/>indemnity check received on account of the industrial accident or illness<br/>provided above, the District shall deduct from the unit member's salary<br/>warrant the amount of such disability indemnity actually paid to and retained<br/>by the unit member.</p>

<p>When employees suffer work-related injuries, unless the treating physician<br/>provides a full release from work, the employees may be considered eligible<br/>for a temporary modified or light-duty assignment to minimize lost time and<br/>to serve to facilitate the transition back to the employee’s regular duties or<br/>full-time work. Modified or light-duty assignments shall be designed to<br/>accommodate medical restrictions specified by the employee’s physician<br/>and may include work in the same job classification or a different job<br/>classification at the employee’s regular salary rate. These assignments are<br/>intended to address short-term medical restrictions and will normally extend<br/>for less than eight weeks’ duration. These assignments shall not be used<br/>as a means to establish new assignments or displace other employees.</p>
<p>In the event the unit member believes the alternate work duties are not<br/>appropriate, the matter will be referred to the Alternate Duties sub-</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>committee. The Alternate Duties sub-committee will be composed of one<br/>PFT representative, one Administrative representative, and one<br/>representative acceptable to the parties.</p>

<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>TRANSFER</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage renewal and the challenge for potential growth, the Federation<br/>and the District Administration agree that the opportunity to transfer to a new work site<br/>should be made available to those wishing to do so. The Federation and the District<br/>Administration also agree that site staffs have the right to develop criteria for choosing a<br/>new staff member and to interview applicants with those criteria in mind (reference AR<br/>4111, Recruitment and Selection “Hiring Protocol”, section 5). Since these two concepts<br/>can sometimes be in conflict, the Federation and the District Administration agree that,<br/>while every member of the Federation wishing a particular transfer has the right to an<br/>interview for positions, the interviewing staffs will have the right to recommend selection<br/>according to their developed criteria.</p>
<p>A. General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members covered by this Agreement are employees of the Petaluma<br/>City (Elementary) District or Petaluma Joint Union High School District and<br/>not of a particular school or department.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer is a move from one school to another, from a special education<br/>position to another special education position, from a special education<br/>position to a regular classroom position, from a regular classroom position<br/>to a special education position, or from special education or regular<br/>classroom position to any other classification (i.e., librarian, counselor, etc.).<br/>A voluntary transfer is a transfer which has been initiated by a unit member.<br/>An involuntary transfer is a transfer which has not been initiated by a unit</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>member.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers within the District shall be consistent with the Board of Education<br/>policy which actively and affirmatively insures equality of opportunity to all<br/>persons regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, marital<br/>status, or physical handicap.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy is defined as an unfilled position, or portion of such position,<br/>which is authorized consistent with provisions of this Agreement found in<br/>Article XI, Class Size, or which has been the subject of specific agreement<br/>between the parties.</p>
<p>Vacancies will be identified in the staffing meetings involving site<br/>administrators. The Federation president and his/her designee shall be<br/>invited to attend such staffing meetings with the understanding that all<br/>parties must observe confidentiality concerning all staffing discussions.</p>
<p>The process for developing transfers will be in the following order:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees are identified.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves are granted for the following year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning from leave are identified and placed<br/>in a position at the first staffing meeting.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative transfers are made at the first staffing meeting.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies are identified at the first staffing meeting.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancy notice is developed and posted.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interviews for transfer applicants and applicants from outside<br/>the district will be held.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member with continuing employment or re-employment rights<br/>is displaced by an assignment of another bargaining unit member, he/she<br/>will not be obliged to go through more than three (3) interviews; rather<br/>he/she will be placed by District Administration, with communication and<br/>consultation with Federation representatives and the individual involved.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If unit members in excess of that number needed for regular classroom<br/>assignments have been employed for a given school year, classroom<br/>and/or other educational positions will be assigned. These assignments<br/>may include, but are not limited to, positions such as resource unit<br/>members at the elementary level, departmental resource positions at the<br/>secondary level, or team teaching positions at all levels. Nothing in this<br/>section excludes other suitable and necessary professional assignments.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration will post all vacancies at the school sites as soon<br/>as they are identified. Unit members who are interested in the listed<br/>vacancies shall notify the Human Resources Office using the appropriate<br/>form with a copy to the principal. Unit members who apply for a vacancy<br/>during the spring shall be guaranteed an interview which will be conducted<br/>in accordance with the &quot;District Hiring Protocol&quot;.</p>
<p>The vacancy notice will specify available particulars concerning the<br/>assignment, e.g., particular skills, specialty areas, or competencies desired.<br/>Since all job interviews are competitive in nature, it will be the responsibility<br/>of unit members applying for vacancies within the District to communicate<br/>the manner and degree in which their particular experiences/skill areas<br/>match the needs cited in the vacancy notice. Unit members may attach<br/>supporting documents to their application form filed in response to the<br/>vacancy notice, e.g., an updated resume, a personal letter, a recent<br/>evaluation summary (s), or letters of reference.</p>
<p>Vacancies which are not filled through individually-initiated transfers will be<br/>subject to the normal &quot;outside&quot; vacancy notice procedure. Similarly,<br/>vacancies which result from successful individually-initiated transfers will<br/>also be subject to the &quot;outside&quot; vacancy notice procedure. Bargaining unit<br/>members may also apply for these positions but must compete with outside<br/>candidates for an interview. Interviews will follow a competitive screening<br/>process conducted in accordance with the &quot;District Hiring Protocol&quot;.</p>
<p>Unit members who wish to be notified regarding any specific vacancy which<br/>may arise shall submit requests for transfer in writing to the Human<br/>Resources Office on the appropriate form with a copy to the principal.<br/>Announcements of vacancies which occur between the last workday in<br/>June and August 15 shall be mailed to unit members who request, in<br/>writing, such mailings.</p>
<p>Requests for a transfer shall include information as to the school, position,<br/>subject, and grade level desired by the applicant. Transfer requests will be<br/>considered for any vacancies identified during the school year in which the<br/>request is filed and/or for the beginning of the school year immediately<br/>following.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member will be notified in writing by the Human Resources Office<br/>that his/her request for transfer has been received.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation and the District Administration shall notify, in writing, a unit<br/>member who has not been transferred to a specifically requested position<br/>as soon as the position has been filled. In addition, the unit member shall<br/>have the right to confer with the Superintendent, or his/her designee,<br/>regarding the matter.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration may initiate transfers when school or<br/>departmental enrollments make such transfers necessary, or when it is<br/>deemed in the best interests of the schools and/or District provided such<br/>decisions will not be discriminatory or capricious. The District and the<br/>Federation agree that no such move will take place without prior<br/>consultation and communication with the Federation, site administrators,<br/>and the unit member impacted by such decisions. All personnel affected will<br/>be notified by letter from the Superintendent, or his/her designee, through<br/>the Human Resources Office. Unit members transferred under this<br/>provision shall be given first consideration to apply for return to the original<br/>assignment should an appropriate vacancy occur. This application will be<br/>considered consistent with the criteria normally used in the District Hiring<br/>Protocol.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of declining enrollment at an elementary school, when a school<br/>must reduce its staff, the following criteria will be used to identify the staff<br/>member to be transferred:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Least amount of total district seniority</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Least amount of seniority at that school site (not to include staff<br/>members who were transferred to the school within the last two<br/>school years from another school using this section)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level experience.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is to be involuntarily transferred or reassigned shall<br/>be informally notified in advance of the formal notice and be given the<br/>opportunity to apply on a voluntary basis for another available position<br/>within the school district. It shall be the intent of the District Administration<br/>to give this informal notification before June 1 of a given school year.<br/>However, due to shifting patterns of enrollment, unexpected personnel<br/>needs, etc., this may not always be possible. When the unit member who<br/>has received such notification makes application for another available<br/>position in the school district, the application will be considered consistent<br/>with the criteria normally used in the District Hiring Protocol in all hiring<br/>decisions.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification of involuntary transfer or reassignment shall be given to the unit<br/>member as soon as the determination has been made. A unit member who<br/>has been transferred shall have the right to confer with the Superintendent,<br/>or his/her designee, to discuss the reason for the transfer.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassigned unit member shall be informed, if possible, of his/her<br/>assignment at least one month prior to the first day of classroom instruction.<br/>If one month lead time is not possible, one day of release time or<br/>compensation shall be provided.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a decision regarding involuntary transfer is made by the District<br/>Administration, the unit member shall be compensated for time required to<br/>move from one school to another. Such compensation shall be at the<br/>substitute unit member rate and may not exceed the equivalent of three<br/>days' payment. In addition, the District Administration will provide physical<br/>assistance in moving the unit member's materials from one site to another.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a room or grade level change is made by the District Administration,<br/>the unit member shall be compensated for time required to move. Such<br/>compensation shall be at the substitute unit member rate and may not<br/>exceed the equivalent of one and one-half day’s payment. In addition, the<br/>District Administration will provide physical assistance in moving the unit<br/>member's materials from one room to another.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the criteria normally used in the District Hiring Protocol, the<br/>District Administration and the Federation agree that a member of the<br/>bargaining unit should not be subject to an excessive number of transfers.</p>
<p>When a unit member has been transferred two times or more within the<br/>past four years, weight shall be given to the unit member's seniority in any<br/>transfer decision considered by the District Administration.</p>
<p>ARTICLE X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAFETY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONDITIONS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration shall make reasonable provisions to ensure that any<br/>unit member will not work under conditions which are determined to be unsafe or<br/>hazardous. Unit members shall report conditions which they believe to be unsafe<br/>or hazardous to the principal. The principal shall inform the unit member as soon<br/>as possible what action, if any, will be taken, and keep the employee informed of<br/>any changes.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who believes he/she is threatened or students are endangered<br/>shall contact the principal immediately. The principal or administrative designee<br/>will take whatever action is necessary (including the notification of law<br/>enforcement) to ensure the unit member's safety.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration will make every reasonable effort to inform unit<br/>members when they are assigned students who have a history of violence toward<br/>staff and/or other students, and/or students who have a history of behaviors and/or<br/>conditions that could constitute a health or safety hazard to staff and/or other<br/>students, as long as such disclosure does not violate the student's right to privacy,<br/>confidentiality, or due process.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Member Facilities</p>
<p>The assignment of room usage (within departments at the secondary level) shall<br/>be determined equitably by the site principal. The sharing of rooms should be<br/>equitable and rotational. The recommended process is consensus, however if</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>consensus cannot be reached, the consultation model will be used (as per page 3<br/>of the Decision-Making Resource Guide).</p>
<p>When two or more unit members share the same workspace, the site administrator<br/>will convene a meeting before school starts to ensure fair and equitable use of the<br/>existing storage facilities and workspace. Unit members have a right to:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storage facilities that can be locked in each room they are assigned.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A desk or table, chair, and one filing cabinet for unit member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use in each</p>
<p>classroom or office area.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A work area containing equipment and supplies to aid in the preparation of<br/>instructional materials.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A room furnished for use of employees as a lounge and/or dining area.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrooms reserved for use by the employees.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PFT and District Administration agree to a phased-in,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site-specific</p>
<p>installation of telephones that are accessible to every unit member. Levels<br/>of phase-in are:</p>
<p>Level I Safety concerns</p>
<p>Level II Professional and technological concerns</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is threatened with bodily harm or who suffers bodily harm<br/>inflicted by an individual or group while fulfilling assigned duties shall promptly<br/>make a report to the Superintendent/Principal who shall inform the designated law<br/>enforcement agency. The District Administration may provide legal and other<br/>related assistance in accordance with applicable law for any assault upon the unit<br/>member while fulfilling assigned duties.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation and the District Administration agree that the practices outlined in<br/>the General Safe Practices Handbook are to be implemented at every site. Unit<br/>members will participate in mandated safety trainings on an annual basis.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may use reasonable force to protect himself/herself from attack, to<br/>protect another person, to protect property or to quell a disturbance threatening<br/>physical injury to others.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage to Personal Property: The District Administration will reimburse unit<br/>members for clothing, eye glasses, or personal property which is appropriate to the<br/>instructional environment and which is damaged or destroyed during the conduct<br/>of a unit member's duties, aside from normal wear and tear and personal<br/>negligence. The unit member shall place on file a written notice with the principal<br/>in advance when any item of value in excess of $150 is brought to campus for use<br/>in class(es). The notice shall indicate the value and the time frame the item will be<br/>on campus.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>I. 1. The parties agree to the implementation of the Provisions for a Safe<br/>Classroom pamphlet outlining student and unit member rights based on<br/>Education Code language. The parties will plan a collaborative workshop<br/>on the pamphlet that will be presented in the first quarter of each school<br/>year in a faculty meeting.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Federation agree to improve the notification to unit<br/>members regarding violent students.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All classroom doors will have the capability to be locked from the inside.<br/>The District and Federation will continue to evaluate the need to secure<br/>other work spaces on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIZE</p>
<p>DISTRICT HIRING</p>
<p>The initial staffing ratio which will govern District hiring shall be based upon projected<br/>regular enrollment figures for the District. Subsequent staffing decisions in the course of<br/>the school year shall be influenced by actual District regular enrollments.</p>
<p>Purpose: To provide an equitable distribution of students within the present financial<br/>constraints. This is not an expression of optimum class size nor does it address the wide<br/>variation in unit member preparation time among the various disciplines.</p>
<p>The term &quot;Classroom Unit Member&quot; means an employee who is employed in a position<br/>requiring certification qualifications and whose duties require him/her to teach pupils in the<br/>schools of that district in regular day classes for the full time for which he/she is employed<br/>during the regular school day.</p>
<p>Management personnel and designated specialist personnel such as counselors,<br/>librarians, psychologists, nurses, speech therapists, special education unit members,<br/>reading unit members, ROP unit members, and SIP unit members, shall not be included<br/>in this computation.</p>
<p>STAFFING RATIO</p>
<p>A. Elementary Staffing Ratio</p>
<p>The District staffing ratio in grades kindergarten (K) to three (3) shall be twenty-four<br/>to one (24:1) based on space available on campus for 2012/13.</p>
<p>The District staffing ratio for regular enrollment projections in the elementary<br/>district shall be based upon one classroom unit member for each twenty-nine (29)<br/>students in regular classrooms (grades four, five and six).</p>
<p>Funding from the Elementary Parcel Tax, Measure D, provides elementary<br/>staffing for two FTEs. In 2012/13 grades 4-6 will be staffed at twenty-nine to one<br/>(29:1). In years when the two FTEs are not required to reduce class size to 29:1,</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>they will be utilized to provide additional staff to performance improvement<br/>schools.</p>
<p>B. Secondary Staffing Ratio</p>
<p>For the 2012/13 school year we will staff to the ratio as stated below:</p>
<p>grades 7-8<br/>grades 9-12</p>
<p>continuation grades 10-12</p>
<p>1:27.2<br/>1:29.07<br/>1:20</p>
<p>Funding from the Secondary Parcel Tax, Measure C, will provide 8 FTEs at the<br/>secondary schools. The staffing ratios and unit member contact load language<br/>(as stated below in sections D and E) will apply to the extent that it does not<br/>exceed 8 FTEs.</p>
<p>CLASS SIZE AND CONTACT LOAD</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary class size limits</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No class in grades kindergarten (K) to three (3) shall be in excess of twenty-<br/>eight (28) students, at any one time, unless a waiver is signed.</p>
<p>The parties will take advantage of the flexibility in Class Size Reduction<br/>(CSR) in grades K-3 provided in the current budget to avoid combination<br/>classrooms, through a site shared decision-making process, where fiscally<br/>feasible. If combination classes are needed, the teachers will be able to<br/>modify the delivery and assessment of standards based curriculum as long<br/>as standards for both grade levels are taught.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District total number of students per class in grades four (4) to six (6)<br/>shall not exceed thirty-two (32).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No single grade four (4) to six (6) class shall exceed thirty-two (32) students,<br/>at any one time, unless a waiver is signed.</p>
<p>A site-based option is allowed where the unit member could agree to take<br/>an additional student instead of having to teach a combination class.<br/>Documentation would be provided to the Federation indicating the shared-<br/>decision making process if this situation arises. If combination classes are<br/>needed, the teachers will be able to modify the delivery and assessment of<br/>standards based curriculum as long as standards for both grade levels are<br/>taught.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class loading at each site may be adjusted by agreement of the staff<br/>through a shared decision-making process.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary class size limits: (Exempt courses: Keyboarding - limited by stations,<br/>Band and Chorus, Independent Study, Computers, and Computer Assisted<br/>Drafting [CAD])</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular class sizes will range from 27 - 33 students per class.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical education classes will range from 31 - 41 students per class.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching assignments outside these limits as mentioned above are to be<br/>allowed only:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as required by law to handle transferring new students;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by unit member request, with PFT notification.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Unit Member Contact Load: (Exempt courses: Keyboarding - limited</p>
<p>by stations, Band and Chorus, Independent Study, Computers, and Computer</p>
<p>Assisted Drafting [CAD])</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular class unit member load shall be 140-165 students, based on<br/>funding from Measure C (see B above), unless under unusual<br/>circumstances a unit member requests a waiver to exceed 165.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical education class unit member load shall be 155-205 student<br/>contacts per day at the comprehensive high schools.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical education class unit member load shall be a maximum of 175<br/>student contacts per day, with a maximum of 36 students per class, to<br/>accommodate Special Day Class students at the junior high schools.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Day Class Students in Elementary and Secondary Classes</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that Special Day Class students who are integrated into<br/>regular education class, &quot;mainstreamed&quot;, are placed in those classes based<br/>upon their lEPs. These students should be counted in the unit member-<br/>student ratio for class-loading purposes. Special Education, Special Day<br/>Class, Full Inclusion and other mainstreamed students shall be equitably<br/>placed in classrooms. In the case of Special Day Class and Full Inclusion<br/>students, there will be a maximum of three (3) students per class. It is<br/>understood that State and Federal Laws for lEP’s will take precedence.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that &quot;mainstreamed&quot; special day class students be<br/>counted as fractions of FTE regular education students as dictated by their<br/>lEPs. For example, a student whose IEP specified 40% time in regular<br/>education, would be counted as a .40 FTE regular education student in<br/>his/her assigned grade. If assigned a 3rd grade with 27.0 regular education<br/>students, the 3rd grade would report 27.40 students with an addition of the<br/>special education &quot;mainstreamed&quot; student. In this manner, the impact of<br/>special day class &quot;mainstreamed&quot; students will be acknowledged in the unit<br/>member-student ratio.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement does not imply that the staffing ratio is in any way adjusted<br/>by these special education &quot;mainstreamed&quot; students.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>G.</p>
<p>Secondary Implementation Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each department at each school site shall meet with the principal or his/her<br/>designee to determine, through a shared decision-making process, where<br/>larger and smaller class loads may occur within the constraints of Sections<br/>D and E above.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members whose situations have not met the above stated criteria shall<br/>have the right to have the Federation represent them through the grievance<br/>process.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Master Schedule</p>
<p>The District will provide the site with the number of sections projected. The<br/>computer generated raw tally and resulting raw sections estimates will be made<br/>available to Principals Advisory Council (PAC). Principals, in consultation with<br/>PAC, will develop the first draft of the master schedule. This draft will be posted<br/>and made available to the entire staff during May.</p>
<p>The District and Federation agree to meet no later than June 1st of each school<br/>year (including alternative calendar schools) in order to review K-12 class size data<br/>for the coming school year. At that time, adjustments will be negotiated for<br/>“under performing schools”.</p>
<p>The District agrees to provide the Federation with K-12 class size data<br/>approximately two (2) weeks after the start of each school year (including<br/>alternative calendar schools).</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Size Committee</p>
<p>A joint District and Federation class size subcommittee will be formed to address<br/>issues, including but not limited to, a long-range phased plan to address district¬<br/>wide class size issues, including mainstreaming, inclusion, combination classes,<br/>and students with diverse needs.</p>
<p>The District and Federation agree to the reconstitution of the class size sub¬<br/>committee, the purpose of which will be to study and recommend contract<br/>language to address the issues of special needs students.</p>
<p>1. Both parties agree to continue deliberation of the Class Size Subcommittee<br/>to develop pilot proposals to address issues including but not limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A differential staffing ratio at sites with high numbers of students with<br/>diverse needs.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long range phased plan to address district wide class size issues.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues including mainstreaming and combination classes.</p>
<p>A committee will be formed to deal with inclusion issues and SED issues.</p>
<p>A study of the impact of various class size reduction scenarios on facilities<br/>shall be conducted, with the capacity of sites to be considered.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROCEDURES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. Unit members will be formally evaluated by a Management Team member<br/>assigned by the Superintendent or his/her designee. The intent of this article is<br/>to establish an employee evaluation process that is logical and consistent with<br/>the California Standards for the Teaching Profession and those standards<br/>unique to Petaluma City Schools. The process will encourage the application of<br/>best practices by both management and employees in a fair, transparent, and<br/>professional manner. Self-ref lection, self-appraisal, continuing professional<br/>development and ongoing professional dialogue are integral to this process.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and Temporary unit employees shall be formally evaluated<br/>at least twice a year per the schedule adopted by the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent employees who have received a satisfactory evaluation shall<br/>be formally evaluated once every four years. The unit member’s overall<br/>performance shall be rated as: “Satisfactory” - Meets or exceeds district<br/>standards; “Provisional” - Continues to work toward meeting district<br/>standards; additional evaluation required next year; improvement plan<br/>required; “Unsatisfactory” - Does not meet district standards; additional<br/>evaluation required next year; improvement plan required; intensive<br/>supervision required.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may be formally evaluated more frequently than every four<br/>years if the administrator determines that there has been a significant<br/>change in the employee’s performance that reduces his/her professional<br/>effectiveness. This determination will be based on objective evidence,<br/>which may come from classroom observations, ongoing supervision,<br/>and/or professional interactions. The evidence will indicate a change in<br/>the employee’s current performance objectively compared to previous<br/>performance as documented in previous evaluations. The administrator<br/>will meet with this employee during the current year to discuss<br/>performance and to provide an opportunity for improvement. The<br/>administrator may recommend that the employee contact PAPR for<br/>support in areas of concern. If the administrator determines there is a<br/>need for a formal evaluation in the following school year, the administrator<br/>will meet with the employee and give the employee written notification<br/>prior to the end of the school year. The employee has the right to have a<br/>representative from the collective bargaining unit at this meeting.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the school year the Management Team member charged with<br/>evaluating personnel will conference with those unit employees as to the<br/>evaluation criteria set out in the Guidelines for Evaluation of Certificated<br/>Personnel. The unit employee will use the Certificated Evaluation Plan as<br/>a self evaluation at the beginning of the year and then share this self-<br/>evaluation with the Management Team Member.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process will typically, but not always involve two formal<br/>observations. During observations, the administrator will take notes<br/>written in objective language focused on established criteria, as well as<br/>overall instruction and classroom learning environment. As part of the<br/>classroom visitation and evaluation process, a unit member may request<br/>that a specific class be observed.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on CA Education Code an administrator may also make<br/>unscheduled and informal visits to classrooms for observation purposes.</p>
<p>Each formal observation will be documented on the District Certificated<br/>Observation Form and the comments on that form will be discussed<br/>during the post-observation conference.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator will complete a final written summative evaluation,<br/>which includes specific performance criteria ratings as well as a narrative<br/>report, both based on evidence from the observation process. The<br/>evidence cited will be consistent with the District adopted standards and<br/>power standards. The overall summative evaluation rating (Satisfactory,<br/>Provisional, Unsatisfactory) will be consistent and logical based on the<br/>totality of evidence included in the observations, ongoing supervision<br/>and/or professional interactions. Recommendations and/or<br/>commendations will be included in the narrative report. Negative<br/>comments will not be included in the summative evaluation statement<br/>unless such matters have been discussed and documented with the unit<br/>member during the current year.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation shall be in three (3) copies, with a copy presented to the<br/>unit member at least thirty (30) days before the end of the school year.<br/>The signature of the person being evaluated does not indicate that he/she<br/>agrees with the evaluation, but that he/she has been presented with a<br/>copy and that a conference was held. Distribution of the three (3) signed<br/>copies is as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to be presented to the person evaluated;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to be retained in the Management Team member’s file;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original to be placed in the employee’s file in the Division of<br/>Human Resources.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member may make such written comments as appropriate to<br/>attach to the evaluation.</p>
<p>Professional Development Plans</p>
<p>1. Each unit employee shall write an annual Professional Development Plan.<br/>The purpose of this plan is to encourage the unit member to stretch<br/>his/her own professional expertise and effectiveness in the classroom and<br/>instruction.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format of the plan will be agreed upon collaboratively with the site<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan will be submitted to the site administrator no later than 45<br/>working days after the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the year, it is expected that each employee will periodically<br/>discuss his/her professional growth areas, as well as other professional<br/>issues, with colleagues as meaningful to completion of the Professional<br/>Development Plans and ongoing professional growth. This may occur in<br/>a variety of settings, including team meetings, department meetings,<br/>grade level meetings, etc.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the employee not submit the plan on time (absent special<br/>circumstances previously discussed with and agreed to by the principal), a<br/>Career Enhancement Plan will then be developed by the principal and unit<br/>member together.</p>
<p>No later than ten (10) days prior to the last day of school unit employees<br/>with Career enhancement Plans will present a year-end report to the site<br/>administrator explaining the progress made on the Career Enhancement<br/>Plan. This report, along with the Enhancement Plan will be placed in the<br/>employee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>C. Personal and Academic Freedom</p>
<p>No electronic or mechanical devices shall be used for evaluation purposes without<br/>the unit member's consent.</p>
<p>D. Personnel Files</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration shall maintain a personnel file for each member<br/>of the unit at the District office. This shall be the District's official personnel<br/>file for each member of the unit. The file shall be an official repository for<br/>materials which affect the status of employment of the unit member.<br/>Contents of the personnel file shall be maintained in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information or statements of a derogatory nature, except material obtained<br/>for the purposes of initial employment, shall not be entered or filed unless<br/>and until the employee is given notice and an opportunity to review and<br/>comment thereon within ten (10) working days. Prior to its placement in the<br/>personnel file, a unit member/designee shall have the right to meet with the<br/>Superintendent/designee to review the information of a derogatory nature<br/>before a determination of its propriety for placement in the personnel file is<br/>made. An employee shall have the right to enter, and have attached to any<br/>derogatory material placed in the file, his/her own comments thereon.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a positive nature may be placed in an employee's file such as<br/>indications of special competencies, achievements, performances, or<br/>contributions of an academic, professional, or civic nature. Material of a</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>similar nature received from responsible outside sources may also be<br/>included in an employee's file. Copies of such material shall be given to an<br/>employee even if not entered in the file.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personnel file of an employee shall be made available for review by the<br/>employee except for confidential material obtained for the purposes of initial<br/>employment. If desired, the employee may be accompanied by a<br/>representative while conducting this review, or the employee may authorize<br/>the representative, in writing, to review the materials independently. The<br/>examination shall be made in the presence of the Human Resources<br/>Administrator or a designee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall have the right to inspect his/her personnel file upon<br/>request. The review must occur at a time when the employee is not actually<br/>required to render service to the District in all cases, except those detailed<br/>in the section regarding derogatory information.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous material shall not be placed in the personnel file, i.e., no<br/>materials shall be entered in the unit member's file which do not bear the<br/>author's signature and date of writing.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be separate<br/>from the personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>Public Charges</p>
<p>In order to promote fair and constructive communication, the following procedures</p>
<p>shall govern the resolution of complaints. Every effort should be made to resolve a</p>
<p>complaint at the earliest possible stage and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>1. Complaints concerning school personnel should be made directly by the<br/>complainant to the person against whom the complaint is lodged.<br/>Parents/guardians are encouraged to attempt to orally resolve concerns<br/>with the unit staff member personally. If the complaint is not resolved, the<br/>complainants are requested to reduce the charge to writing to the school<br/>principal. The school principal shall immediately forward a copy of the<br/>complaint to the unit member.</p>

If the complaint involves a student, permission<br/>for an Open Session must also be obtained in writing from the student's<br/>parents or guardian.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a complaint involves an issue which the law requires to be referred to<br/>another agency for investigation, the complaint will be so referred and this<br/>article shall not apply.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEDERATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RIGHTS</p>
<p>A. The Federation shall have the right to transact organization business on school<br/>property at all reasonable times, provided that it does not interfere with or interrupt<br/>class or other normal school operations. Such rooms or other appropriate meeting</p>

<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Standards</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mandated by Government Code Section 3543.2(b), the parties have met<br/>and negotiated in good faith regarding alternative methods of dealing with<br/>cases of unsatisfactory actions by a unit member, in the performance of<br/>professional duties, short of implementing the dismissal procedures<br/>contained in Education Code Section 44941.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this section is to promote high professional standards by<br/>providing a corrective and remedial sequence of steps as a means of<br/>assisting unit members if the need arises. This section represents a method<br/>of dealing with cases of unsatisfactory performance of professional duties<br/>short of outright termination.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the parties that a unit member charged with unsatisfactory<br/>actions be accorded the following rights in the implementation of this<br/>section:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full and complete statement of the charges (Item 6),</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity to be represented by the Federation and/or other<br/>representation of the unit member's choice (Items 7 &amp; 8),</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity to rebut the charges through the submission of<br/>evidence or testimony (Items 7 &amp; 8),</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>d. The right to appeal, as outlined in this section (Item 9).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of this section, the unit member shall not be cited<br/>without just cause as defined below. It shall be the practice of the District to<br/>give an informal, verbal warning before implementation of the formal<br/>procedures contained in this section, except in cases of more serious<br/>incidents.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this section, the District may take action for alleged unsatisfactory<br/>actions in the performance of professional duties only in the following<br/>cases:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violations of District policy, regulations or the general code of ethics<br/>and conduct expected of professional educators,</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abusive behavior, of a physical or verbal nature, toward students,<br/>fellow employees or the public while performing school-related<br/>activities.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to perform obligations under the contract.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To initiate the formal procedures of this article, the Superintendent, or<br/>his/her designee, shall notify the unit member and the Federation in writing<br/>of the alleged unsatisfactory action. Neither this notice, nor any other<br/>written record pertaining to this section, shall be placed in the unit member's<br/>personnel file until he/she has had an opportunity to respond in writing. The<br/>response of the unit member shall be appended to the District document.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following written notification of the alleged unsatisfactory action, a<br/>conference shall be scheduled to discuss the matter. The conference shall<br/>include the unit member, a Federation representative, the principal or<br/>immediate supervisor, and the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>Within five (5) working days following the conference, the Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee shall notify the unit member and the Federation in writing<br/>of the action to be taken by the District.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progressive actions that may be taken by the District shall be limited to<br/>the following. All these actions must be taken in order and none may be by¬<br/>passed except in cases of the most serious actions, e.g., abuse of students,<br/>occasions of use of alcoholic beverages or other drug abuse which makes<br/>the unit member unfit to instruct or associate with children, etc. The<br/>notification and conference procedures described above shall precede each<br/>of the progressive District actions.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written warning, with suggestions for correction of the problem.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second written notice, which will serve as &quot;probation&quot; for a<br/>specified period of time during which the unit member may correct<br/>the problem.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension without pay for a specified period of time which is not to<br/>exceed a maximum of five work days.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the unsatisfactory action be repeated within eighteen (18)<br/>calendar months, the District may elect to continue at progressive<br/>action (c).</p>
<p>9. The unit member and the Federation may elect to appeal the progressive<br/>action to be taken by the District on the basis that such action is<br/>unwarranted. The notice of appeal shall be delivered to the Superintendent,<br/>or his/her designee, within five (5) days following the communication from<br/>the District concerning the action to be taken. Upon notice of appeal, such<br/>action shall be stayed pending the appeal process. The appeal process<br/>may take either of the following forms:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member and the Federation may request that an appeal<br/>panel be convened. The panel shall consist of a unit member<br/>selected by the unit member and the Federation, an administrator<br/>selected by the District and an impartial party selected by the other<br/>two.</p>
<p>The appeal panel shall hold an informal hearing solely for the<br/>purpose of determining whether the progressive action to be taken<br/>by the District is warranted. The decision of the panel shall be<br/>binding on all parties. Expenses related to the impartial third party<br/>shall be equally shared by the Federation and the District. Other<br/>expenses shall be the responsibility of the party incurring them.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member and the Federation may invoke the provisions for<br/>binding arbitration given in Article XIV, Grievance Procedure (Level<br/>V). The sole responsibility of the arbitrator, in this instance, shall be<br/>to determine whether the progressive action to be taken by the<br/>District is warranted. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding<br/>on all parties.</p>
<p>Organizational Security</p>
<p>1. Each member of the bargaining unit, shall as a condition of employment,<br/>maintain his/her membership in good standing for the duration of the written<br/>agreement or join the Petaluma Federation of Teachers or pay to the<br/>Petaluma Federation of Teachers a service fee in an amount not to exceed<br/>the standard initiation fee, period dues, and general assessments of the<br/>Petaluma Federation of Teachers. Those who choose not to become<br/>members of the Federation shall have deducted from their salary warrant<br/>the amounts due for each month of the school year beginning in September<br/>and concluding in June.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Petaluma Federation of Teachers shall notify the District of the<br/>appropriate amounts and any changes thereto in writing. In no event shall<br/>the amount of such fee exceed the amount of dues, initiation fees, or<br/>regular assessments of the Petaluma Federation of Teachers' members.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are employed half-time or less and are paid on the unit<br/>members' salary schedule shall pay one-half of the allotted fee in the<br/>manner described above.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation shall submit all necessary forms and information to the<br/>Payroll Division.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall remit the appropriate amount deducted to the Federation<br/>every month.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation shall indemnify fully and otherwise hold harmless the<br/>District in the enforcement of this organizational security agreement.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mutual agreement with the Federation, any unit member who, because<br/>of religious beliefs and/or on grounds of conscience, cannot pay fees to a<br/>union may select either the United Way or scholarship funds at Casa<br/>Grande or Petaluma High School, and the Federation shall contribute the<br/>amount received each month to that charity.</p>
<p>If the Federation and a unit member are not in agreement concerning the<br/>stated prohibition against paying monies to a union, the unit member may<br/>appeal the matter in writing to the Superintendent or his/her designee. In<br/>such case, an appeal panel shall be convened. The panel shall be<br/>composed of the Superintendent or his/her designee, the President of the<br/>Federation or his/her designee, and a third party chosen by the other two<br/>panel members. The decision of this panel shall be binding on all parties.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although payment of the organizational security fee is a condition of<br/>employment, the Federation hereby waives its rights to require the<br/>discharge or discipline of bargaining unit members who do not conform to<br/>this agreement.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this section shall not become effective until mutually<br/>ratified by the parties. It is further agreed that, for purposes of ratification by<br/>members of the bargaining unit, this section shall be severed from all other<br/>matters subject to ratification by virtue of a separate ballot. Details<br/>regarding this severed ratification process shall be established by the<br/>parties.</p>
<p>J. PFT President released to conduct Federation business will be at no cost to the<br/>District. The District will invoice PFT annually based on Column III Step 3 on the<br/>salary schedule, plus employer and health benefits for that portion of an FTE that<br/>represents the leave. The present PFT President will return to full time service<br/>upon retirement as president with no loss of seniority or service years.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>K. Temporary Unit Member Assignments</p>
<p>Each school year, the District will offer temporary teaching assignments equal to<br/>the number of regular unit members currently on leave. The District may also<br/>advertise and offer positions as probationary in cases of special need. As a result<br/>of increasing enrollment and/or attrition, individuals employed on temporary<br/>contracts may later be offered probationary status. District decisions concerning<br/>the offer of probationary contracts will be based upon the following criteria:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projected staffing needs, i.e., grade level/subject</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations received by the temporary unit members</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations by administrators and members of the unit members'<br/>bargaining unit</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials held by the temporary unit member, i.e., grade level/subject</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority in the District</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supply and demand in the profession.</p>
<p>A copy of this section will be shared with each unit member on temporary contract<br/>to provide better communication regarding decisions concerning probationary<br/>positions. Each fall or spring, the Superintendent, or her/his designee, will share<br/>information with the Federation concerning the number of unit members on leave<br/>and the number of unit members under temporary contract.</p>
<p>Upon request, the Superintendent, or his/her designee, will meet with individual<br/>unit members and/or representatives of the Federation in order to discuss<br/>decisions concerning movement to probationary status.</p>
<p>L. District Budget Committee</p>
<p>The District Administration and the Federation agree to the continuation of the<br/>District Budget Committee. The committee will be composed of representatives<br/>chosen by the Petaluma Federation of Teachers, Petaluma Leadership<br/>Association, California School Employees Association, Petaluma Chapter #212,<br/>and Petaluma Confidential Employees. The Committee will be co-chaired by<br/>organization representatives and the Superintendent or designee.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the central administrative offices of the<br/>Petaluma School Districts are open for business.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator, having<br/>immediate jurisdiction over the grievant, who has been designated to adjust<br/>grievances.</p>

<p>The Board of Education shall issue a written decision within fifteen<br/>(15) days.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level V</p>
<p>If the grievance is not resolved satisfactorily at Level IV, the grievant<br/>may, within ten (10) days after the decision by the Board of<br/>Education, submit the matter to binding arbitration. This can only be<br/>done with the concurrence of the Federation. If both the District and<br/>the Federation agree, the matter could be referred to mediation<br/>before proceeding to binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Procedures for Binding Arbitration:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by an<br/>arbitrator to be selected by the District and the Federation<br/>within ten (10) days after said notice is given. If the two<br/>parties fail to reach agreement on an arbitrator within five (5)<br/>days, the California State Conciliation Service will be<br/>requested to supply a list of five (5) names. Each party will<br/>alternately strike from the list until only one name remains.<br/>The order of striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall hold a hearing, if possible, within ten (10)<br/>days of his/her appointment. Five (5) days' notice will be<br/>given to all parties of the time and place of the hearing.<br/>Within ten (10) days after completion of the hearing, the<br/>arbitrator shall render the decision in writing and shall set forth<br/>his/her findings in fact, reasoning and conclusions on the</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>issues submitted.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any<br/>decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited<br/>by law or which violates the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to empower the<br/>arbitrator to make any decisions amending, changing,<br/>subtracting from, or adding to, the provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared<br/>equally by the District and Federation. All other expenses<br/>shall be borne by the party incurring them, and neither party<br/>shall be responsible for the expense of witnesses called by<br/>the other. If any grievance meeting or hearing shall be<br/>scheduled during the school day, a reasonable number of unit<br/>members required to participate as witnesses or grievants in<br/>such meeting or hearing shall be released from regular duties<br/>without loss of pay for a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator, consistent with the language of<br/>this section, shall be binding on both parties. In the event of a<br/>financial award, the amount shall be limited to $5,000. This<br/>provision does not apply to matters for which a specific<br/>method of review is provided by law.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall<br/>be separate from the personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of a grievance takes place, the grievant<br/>is required to conform to the original decision of his/her<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCERTED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District Administration and the Federation that all provisions of<br/>this Agreement shall be adhered to by both parties.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation agrees that all members of the bargaining unit shall perform all<br/>duties normally associated with their positions, and there shall be no strike,<br/>slowdown, &quot;work-to-rule&quot;, sick-out, or any other failure to perform required duties.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration agrees there shall be no lock-out, or other action<br/>tantamount to lock-out, against members of the bargaining unit as a result of<br/>bargaining difficulties between the parties.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a violation of paragraph &quot;B&quot; above, the Federation agrees to advise<br/>the parties concerned to cease such action. The District Administration may</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>withhold any right granted by this Agreement or by other provisions of District<br/>policy or regulations from those employees committing the violation, or from the<br/>Federation should it be guilty of the violation.</p>
<p>E. In the event of a violation of paragraph &quot;C&quot; above, the District Administration<br/>agrees to cease such action. Should the violation not be corrected, the Federation<br/>and members of the unit are released from their obligations under this article, and<br/>bound only by the requirements of state law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUPPORT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration and the Federation agree that it is to their mutual<br/>benefit to encourage the resolution of differences through the meet and<br/>negotiation process.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is agreed that the District Administration and the Federation will<br/>support and abide by this Agreement for its term and will not seek to change its<br/>provisions other than through the meet and negotiation process.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAVINGS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provisions of this Agreement are held to be contrary to law by a court of<br/>competent jurisdiction, such provisions will not be deemed valid and subsisting<br/>except to the extent permitted by law, but all other provisions will continue in full<br/>force and effect.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that certain provisions have been found to be contrary to law and<br/>consequently deemed invalid during the duration of this Agreement, the parties<br/>agree to meet and negotiate on the issue(s) affected within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVIII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPLETION OF MEET AND NEGOTIATE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Agreement, the District Administration and the Federation<br/>shall not be obligated to meet and negotiate with respect to any subject or matter<br/>whether referred to or covered in this Agreement or not, even though each subject<br/>or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or<br/>both the District or the Federation at the time they met and negotiated on and<br/>executed this Agreement, and even though such subjects or matters were<br/>proposed and later withdrawn.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to personnel matters which are legally within the scope of negotiations<br/>affecting members of the bargaining unit which are part of Board policy and not<br/>part of this Agreement, the District Administration indicates it is not its intent to<br/>change such policies for the duration of this Agreement. However, should the<br/>District Administration determine the need to make changes in such policies during<br/>the duration of this Agreement, the District Administration agrees, upon request of<br/>the Federation, to meet and negotiate regarding such changes.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Administration and the Federation agree that with regard to the<br/>definition of educational objectives, the determination of the content of courses<br/>and curriculum, and the selection of textbooks, to the extent such matters are<br/>within the discretion of the public school employer under the law, the Federation<br/>shall have the right to consultation if it so requests.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to an interest-based approach to negotiate proposed changes in<br/>Board Policy, which are within the legal scope of negotiations.</p>
<p>The District will provide copies to the Federation of all Board Policies at least one<br/>week prior to the first reading to the Board.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIX &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PEER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSISTANCE AND PEER REVIEW</p>
<p>A. Program Components</p>
<p>There shall be a Peer Assistance and Peer Review (PAPR) Program (hereafter<br/>referred to as 'Program&quot;) for all unit members. For the purposes of this article<br/>“review” refers to the peer coach’s review of the unit member progress in the<br/>PAPR Program. The Program shall have two distinct components:</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance goals for a participating unit member shall be in<br/>writing, clearly stated, aligned with pupil learning, and consistent<br/>with section 44662 of the California Education Code.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Program shall not deal with unit members' employment issues<br/>which arise from accusations of misconduct which are distinct from<br/>unit members' evaluations in relationship to the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession and Article XII (Evaluation)<br/>of this Contractual Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Peer Assistance Program</p>
<p>Any unit member desiring assistance in improving their practice may apply</p>
<p>to the PAPR Committee for such assistance on a confidential basis.</p>

<p>56</p>
<p>b. If a unit member voluntarily requests PAPR program support,<br/>documentation will not be placed in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Program shall be operated by the PAPR Committee composed of two<br/>District members and two PFT members (one elementary unit member<br/>and one secondary unit member). Decisions shall be made by consensus<br/>where possible. Should a vote be required, action must be taken on an<br/>affirmative vote of at least three (3) members. Unit members on the panel<br/>will be selected by the Federation and be acceptable to the District<br/>Administration. Administrators will be selected by the District<br/>Administration and be acceptable to the Federation. The Federation<br/>President or his designee (designee has to be an active PFT member)<br/>and the Human Resources Administrator will be ex-officio members.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting at least two (2) times annually to review the work of the<br/>coaches with their caseloads;</p>

<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing coaches' interventions.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Committee member shall neither participate in discussion nor vote on<br/>any matter in which he/she has a professional or personal conflict of<br/>interest.</p>

<p>57</p>
<p>c.</p>
<p>Peer Coaches</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Coaches shall be credentialed classroom unit members with<br/>permanent status. Coaches shall have substantial recent experience (at<br/>least five years). They shall have demonstrated exemplary ability, as<br/>indicated by effective communication skills, subject matter knowledge,<br/>and mastery of a range of strategies necessary to meet the needs of<br/>pupils in different contexts.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Peer Coaches are subject to annual evaluation by the Committee. The<br/>documentation of such evaluation shall not be made a part of the coach's<br/>personnel file except upon the express written request of the individual<br/>coach.</p>
<p>D. Unit Member Assistance on Unsatisfactory Evaluation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Program is to assist and offer remediation to unit<br/>members whose performance has been evaluated as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; by<br/>the administrator. Written documentation of PAPR support and<br/>recommendations in the final report shall become a part of the unit<br/>member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime focus of this program is to provide assistance and renew<br/>quality performance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance and remedial efforts and activities shall be intense and<br/>multifaceted and shall be preceded by a conference in the spring of the<br/>year when the unit member receives the &quot;unsatisfactory” evaluation. The<br/>conference shall involve the unit member being referred, the evaluator<br/>who evaluated the unit member, and the peer coach to begin the<br/>development of an Improvement Plan. If the unit member so desires,</p>
<p>P.F.T. shall provide representation in this meeting.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this article precludes the administrator from doing informal<br/>observations nor from notifying the unit member verbally and/or in writing<br/>regarding incidents or events related to the unit member’s fulfillment of<br/>his/her professional obligations.</p>
<p>a. Should the administrator deem it necessary to communicate with a<br/>unit member in this intervention program in a manner that relates to<br/>progressive discipline, i.e. letter of warning, reprimand, etc., he/she<br/>shall copy the coach who shall report the same to the PAPR<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>Employee rights as described in Article XII, D Personnel Files. E<br/>Public Charges, and Article XIII, H Professional Standards, of this<br/>document will continue to apply.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>During the period of assistance, the permanent unit member’s review shall<br/>be the joint responsibility of the Peer Coach and the PAPR Committee<br/>with communication and consultation of the administrator. It is the intent<br/>of the parties that the coach’s report to the Committee will be included in<br/>the unit member’s personnel file along with the unit member’s evaluation<br/>for the year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistance shall be provided by the Peer Coaches under this article<br/>and shall be closely monitored by the PAPR Committee.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peer Coach will share all written and verbal reviews during a<br/>conference with the unit member at least once every six weeks. A copy of<br/>the written reviews will be provided to the administrator and the PAPR<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time reviews are reported to the PAPR Committee regarding<br/>referred unit members' performance, the Peer Coach will provide an oral<br/>report and all written documentation regarding the progress of the referred<br/>unit member in the assistance program.</p>
<p>a. The unit member and administrator may, at their discretion, be<br/>present for the Peer Coach's final presentation and will be given an<br/>opportunity to respond to the report.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course of assistance shall include one or more of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple classroom observations by the Peer Coach;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance specific to the criteria which has been evaluated to be<br/>“unsatisfactory&quot;;</p>
<p>1. Or other areas deemed in need of assistance by the coach<br/>during the period of assistance.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for the unit member receiving assistance to observe<br/>exemplary practice either by the Peer Coach or other exemplary<br/>unit member;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District provided professional development opportunities;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference attendance, often in the company of the peer coach to<br/>facilitate reflection on how this experience fits into the Improvement<br/>Plan;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of assistance which the peer coach and the PAPR<br/>Committee may provide; and</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties understand that every possible subject matter<br/>competency may not be available within the scope of Peer Coaches,<br/>and therefore it shall occasionally be necessary to secure additional</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>assistance to fully address identified deficiencies. In such cases, the<br/>peer coach shall maintain primary responsibility for the improvement<br/>plan but may function more like a case manager who assures the<br/>availability of appropriate resources.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. At the conclusion of the year of assistance, the PAPR Committee</p>
<p>shall recommend that:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the unit member no longer needs PAPR support, or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is deemed by the Committee to be making<br/>progress and needs to continue in the PAPR process for a<br/>second year, or</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAPR Committee and peer coach do not consider that<br/>further assistance and remediation will be successful with<br/>reasons in support of this conclusion. The District may then<br/>initiate dismissal proceedings.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendation of the PAPR Committee shall be reported to<br/>the permanent unit member, the coach, and the administrative<br/>evaluator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section shall be construed as in any way limiting the<br/>authority of the administrator to submit an evaluation to the Human<br/>Resources Administrator.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Administrator shall take into consideration<br/>the Peer Coaches report in making any recommendations to the<br/>Board regarding a unit member’s employment.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deliberations of the PAPR Committee shall be closed and confidential;<br/>their decisions shall be based on the information provided by the coach, the<br/>administrator, the permanent unit member and/or P.F.T. representative who<br/>is assigned.</p>
<p>a. The report of the vote shall only include the number of PAPR<br/>Committee members voting on each side of any question before<br/>the PAPR Committee.</p>
<p>Unit member Due Process Rights</p>
<p>1. The unit member shall be entitled to review all reports generated by the<br/>peer coach prior to their submission to the PAPR Committee and to have<br/>affixed thereto his/her comments. To effectuate this right, the peer coach<br/>shall provide the unit member being reviewed with copies of such reports<br/>at least five (5) working days prior to any such meeting.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have a right to be represented by P.F.T. in any<br/>meetings of the PAPR Committee to which they are called and shall be<br/>given a reasonable opportunity to present his/her point of view concerning<br/>any report being made.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Program in no manner diminishes the legal rights of bargaining unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>F. Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not have access to the grievance process to<br/>challenge the contents of reports, evaluations, or recommendations of the<br/>Committee but may file responses which shall become part of the official<br/>record of the intervention.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PFT and the District shall review the PAPR Program annually during the<br/>spring at EERC and a budget will be mutually agreed upon at that time. A<br/>report from the Committee will be submitted prior to this meeting.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAPR Coaches stipend includes remuneration for the coaching and any<br/>necessary trainings. Funds shall be budgeted to allow the Peer Coaches<br/>release time for conferences as developmental tools with the unit<br/>members assigned to the Program.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retention of Education Code Rights: Nothing herein shall modify or in any<br/>manner affect the rights of the Governing Board/District under provisions<br/>of the Education Code relating to the employment, classification, retention<br/>or non-reelection of certificated employees.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall hold harmless the members of the Committee and the<br/>coaches for any liability arising out of their participation in this Program as<br/>provided in Education Code Section 44503(c).</p>
