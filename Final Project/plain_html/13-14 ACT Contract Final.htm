<p>ARTICLE III<br/>CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>

<p>1. Unit members shall have the professional responsibility to arrive prior to the beginning of the<br/>teacher's assignment and to stay a reasonable period of time after the end of the teacher's<br/>assignment to fulfill adequately the responsibilities required of the teacher.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall also be at school as required for purposes of conference with parents,<br/>for faculty meetings, for supervision of non-classroom activities, and for the performance of<br/>other professional duties.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary classroom teachers (grades 1-5) shall have two and one-half (2.50) hours of<br/>preparation time per week unless there are irresolvable scheduling problems at the building<br/>level.</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the implementation of new or revised offerings, the District will make every<br/>attempt to meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the student and teacher editions of all required textbooks shall be available to each<br/>teacher instructing in the program one week prior to the start of school.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single copies of all support materials to be utilized in the course, other than that generated<br/>by the teacher, shall be provided one week prior to the start of school.</p>
<p>c. Teachers hired subsequent to August 15, and who are to be involved in the implementation<br/>of items 9a and 9b above, shall receive all pertinent materials immediately upon hire.</p>
<p>SCHOOL CALENDAR (Refer to Appendix D)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school term shall consist of one hundred eighty (180) teaching days plus six (6)<br/>additional days:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) additional work days</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one (1) teacher workday</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one (1) floating teacher workday prior to the first day of school</p>
<p>Note: If the building principal requires staff members to be on duty as a total faculty on<br/>the floating teacher workday, a majority vote of the faculty shall determine the date.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) staff orientation/association meeting / site faculty meeting day</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) mandatory staff development workdays</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) grade level/department, or special group planning workday<br/>The content and organization will be determined by the principal</p>
<p>If the building principal requires staff members to be on duty as a total faculty, a<br/>majority vote of the faculty shall determine the first teacher workday.</p>
<p>In the event the state suspends or eliminates all or any significant amount of the<br/>funding for staff development (buyback days), the district will not be obligated to<br/>continue the mandatory staff development days. Any associated reduction in the<br/>work year will be reflected in a per diem adjustment to the salary schedule.</p>
<p>This agreement does not provide the district with any additional rights to re-assign the purpose<br/>of those days, for example, operate school.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary teachers may have up to ten (10) shortened days [five (5) per<br/>semester] and secondary school teachers may have up to five (5) shortened days<br/>per year for the purpose of parent/teacher conferences.</p>
<p>The total amount of expected conference time for teachers will be equal to the amount of<br/>time the students are released from school on the shortened day. It is assumed that<br/>conferences will be scheduled for an average of thirty (30) minutes per conference at the<br/>elementary level and fifteen (15) minutes per conference at the secondary level.</p>
<p>If the District provides fewer than ten (10) minimum days for elementary, or fewer than five</p>
<p>(5) for secondary (the days shall be consecutive), the following formula will be used to<br/>determine the appropriate amount of teacher release time:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12:30 - 3:00 p.m.= 2 !4 hours = 5 conferences per day for elementary,</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 10 conferences per day for secondary</p>
<p>If the amount of release time is not sufficient for a teacher to complete all required<br/>conferences in the designated number of days provided, the teacher may choose to be<br/>compensated at the certificated hourly rate (as stipulated on the certificated salary<br/>schedule) for up to 2 V2 hours for each extra day required (up to the maximum of five (5)<br/>per semester); or may choose to have the district provide a half-day substitute in order for<br/>the teacher to accomplish all parent/teacher conferences.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>If there are 4 minimum days assigned for conferences in the spring.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers with 20 or fewer conferences will complete them in the allotted<br/>amount of time.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher with 21 conferences would receive a V2 hour of pay, or % hour of<br/>release time.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher with 25 conferences, or more, would receive 2 % hours of pay, or a<br/>half-day substitute for release time.</p>
<p>[Note: The total of district provided minimum and release days shall not exceed five (5) per semester.]</p>
<p>C. UNIT MEMBER TRAVEL</p>
<p>Unit members who are required to use their own automobiles to perform required duties<br/>shall be reimbursed at the rate allowed for Internal Revenue Service deduction purposes<br/>(rounded down to the nearest cent). A unit member assigned to more than one (1) site shall<br/>be reimbursed for actual mileage from his/her first assignment of the day to any subsequent<br/>assignment(s).</p>
<p>Unit members who live north of Mai Paso Bridge, and are employed at Captain Cooper<br/>School on a full-time basis, will receive a hardship / mileage stipend in the amount of $2000<br/>per school year. The stipend is in lieu of mileage reimbursement and will be prorated over<br/>eleven (11) months.</p>
<p>Itinerant staff assigned to Captain Cooper on a full-day basis will be reimbursed one way<br/>mileage (26 miles) from the District Office.</p>
<p>D. UNIT MEMBER ORIENTATION</p>
<p>An Association of Carmel Teachers meeting shall be scheduled for one (1) hour during the<br/>all-District orientation program to be held prior to the opening day of school, for the purpose<br/>of conducting organization business.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of the ACT, CTA/NEA, or who has applied for membership,<br/>may sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of Association<br/>membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments of the Association. Pursuant to<br/>such authorization, the District shall deduct one tenth of such dues from the regular salary<br/>check of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit members who<br/>sign such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall be appropriately pro¬<br/>rated to complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member hired subsequent to June 30, 1984 who is not a member of the ACT,<br/>CTA/NEA, or who does not make application for membership within thirty (30) days of the<br/>effective date of this Agreement, or within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of<br/>assigned duties, shall pay the Association a service fee.

Payment of the service fee shall be a condition of continued employment, but the<br/>District shall not be required to dismiss any unit member for failure to pay it. Instead the sole<br/>required means to enforce this provision shall be that upon a unit member's failure to pay the<br/>fee directly to the Association, the District shall immediately begin automatic payroll deductions<br/>as provided in Education code Section 45061 in the same manner as set forth in paragraph E,<br/>1 of this article.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or</p>
<p>teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting unit member<br/>organizations shall not be required to join or financially support ACT, CTA/NEA.

<p>Foundation to Assist California Teachers</p>
<p>United Way of the Monterey Peninsula</p>
<p>b. Proof of payment and a written statement of objection along with verifiable evidence of<br/>membership in a religious body described at paragraph 4, a. of this article shall be<br/>made on an annual basis to the District as a condition of continued exemption from the<br/>provision of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of this article. Payment shall be in the form of<br/>receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of payment, and to<br/>whom payment has been made. Such proof shall be presented on or before the due<br/>date of cash dues/fees for the Association school year. The Association shall have the<br/>right of inspection in order to review said proof of payment.</p>
<p>c. Any unit member making payments as set forth in paragraphs 3, a and 3, b<br/>above, and who requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this<br/>Agreement be used in his/her behalf, shall be responsible for paying the<br/>reasonable cost of using said grievance or arbitration procedures.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2, and 3<br/>above, whether for membership dues or agency fee, the District agrees to remit promptly<br/>such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members for<br/>whom such deductions have been made, categorizing them as to membership or non¬<br/>membership in the Association, and indicating any changes in personnel from the list<br/>previously furnished.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the<br/>provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the District from any<br/>claims arising from and/or pertaining to the District's implementation of this Article III,</p>

<p>ARTICLE VI<br/>LEAVES</p>
<p>A. SICK LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each full-time certificated unit member shall be allowed sick leave as provided in the Education<br/>Code, plus one additional sick leave day. Any days not used shall be accumulated by the unit<br/>member for use, if necessary, during the succeeding years. All unit members are covered by<br/>Workers’ Compensation Insurance for injury in line of duty.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members contracted for work days before and/or after the regular work year will receive<br/>additional sick leave on a pro-rata basis in increments of one-half (1/2) sick leave for each ten<br/>(10) working days. This provision excludes all summer school unit members.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon reasonable cause, the District may require doctor’s certification (or proof of treatment<br/>and the need therefore by the practice of any well-recognized church or denomination) before<br/>allowing pay for absence due to accident or illness.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any certificated unit member who has unused sick leave for accident or illness accumulated in<br/>another California school district at the time he/she is employed in the District and such<br/>employment occurs within one (1) year of his/her previous employment, shall be credited in<br/>this District with the accumulated day(s) upon verification of the day(s) by the former school<br/>district.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Program (Refer to Appendix F)</p>
<p>The purpose of the Catastrophic Leave Program is to permit employees to donate to a<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank that will be used to support an employee when that employee, or<br/>a member of his or her immediate family, suffers from a catastrophic illness or injury, and<br/>the employee has exhausted all sick leave and other paid leave options.</p>
<p>Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate the<br/>employee for an extended period of time, hereby defined as not less than ten (10)<br/>consecutive duty days, or that incapacitates a member of the employee’s immediate family<br/>that requires the employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time [ten<br/>(10) consecutive days] to care for that family member.</p>
<p>Participants who have exhausted regular sick leave, but still have differential leave<br/>available to them, shall be eligible for the Catastrophic Leave Program credits. The District<br/>shall pay the participant full pay, and the credits shall be charged at one-half (1/2) day of<br/>sick leave for each day of absence.</p>
<p>For purposes of this program, immediate family means spouse, domestic partner, or child.<br/>Requests to use catastrophic leave for a family member other than the employee’s<br/>immediate family will be submitted for consideration to the Superintendent and Association<br/>President. If the Superintendent and Association President mutually agree to either<br/>approve or disapprove the request, the matter is settled. Whenever the Superintendent and<br/>Association President disagree, the matter will be referred to the Board of Education for a<br/>final decision.</p>
<p>a. Donations to the Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>The District shall establish a Catastrophic Leave Bank to which all unit members<br/>may donate one (1) day of their earned and unused sick leave days. This donation<br/>shall be irrevocable, and shall be accomplished by the unit member filing a<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank: Sick Leave Donation Form (see Appendix F) prior to<br/>October 1 of the school year or within thirty (30) days of employment. This process<br/>shall be administered by the Fluman Resources Office. This form shall clearly state<br/>that sick leave days being donated are irrevocably given to the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank and cannot be rescinded for any reason whatsoever. A donation to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be a general donation and shall not be donated to a<br/>specific employee for his or her exclusive use. Participation is voluntary, but<br/>requires a donation to the Bank. Only donors will be permitted to withdraw from the<br/>Bank. Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first<br/>becoming eligible must wait until the next open enrollment period and are not<br/>eligible to withdraw from the Bank until they are enrolled.</p>
<p>The annual rate of donation by each participating unit member for each school year<br/>shall be limited to one (1) day of sick leave. Part-time unit members may contribute<br/>and use catastrophic leave on a pro-rata basis. Donations will be accepted during a<br/>thirty (30) day period beginning September 1 of each school year. The donation<br/>period will not occur in any year in which the Bank contains ninety (90) or more<br/>days. For employees who did not donate during the initial enrollment period, the<br/>Bank will reopen every three (3) years. Existing participants will not be asked to<br/>donate unless the Bank has fallen below ninety (90) days. New employees will be<br/>offered the opportunity to participate in the Catastrophic Leave Program regardless<br/>of the number of days in the Bank. At any time that the Bank is in danger of not<br/>being able to meet the demand, the Superintendent and Association President may<br/>call for a special donation period. Participating unit members shall make a donation<br/>each time a donation period is opened until such time that a unit member notifies<br/>the Fluman Resources Office in writing of his or her desire to cancel participation.<br/>The unit member shall not be eligible to draw from the bank as of the effective date<br/>of the cancellation. Any participating unit member who does not have earned and</p>
<p>unused sick leave available when a donation period occurs shall be allowed to<br/>continue in the program until he or she has earned additional sick leave. At that<br/>point the donation will be automatically deducted from the unit member’s accrued<br/>sick leave.</p>
<p>b. Withdrawals from the Bank</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Program participants who are in danger of exhausting their sick<br/>leave may apply to withdraw from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury (see<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank: Request Form; Appendix F). Unit members must use all<br/>sick leave, but not differential leave, available to them before being eligible for a<br/>withdrawal from the Bank. Participants who are approved and who have exhausted<br/>all accrued sick leave are entitled to supplement their differential leave with<br/>Catastrophic Leave charged at one-half day increments. Withdrawals from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of not more than thirty (30) days.<br/>Unit members may submit requests for up to three (3) extensions or withdrawals as<br/>their prior grants expire. A Unit member’s withdrawal from the Bank may not exceed<br/>a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) days for the same injury or illness.</p>
<p>Requests for withdrawals shall be submitted to the Superintendent. The<br/>superintendent or designee may then grant the withdrawal, provided that the unit<br/>member meets the eligibility criteria established in the Agreement. Unit members<br/>who apply to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>will be required to submit a doctor’s statement indicating the nature of the illness or<br/>injury and the probable length of absence from work.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave credits shall not be used for illness or disability which qualifies<br/>the unit member for worker’s compensation or disability benefits. Unit members do<br/>not accrue sick leave while using catastrophic leave credits.</p>
<p>If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal<br/>request, the District is under no obligation to pay the participant any funds<br/>whatsoever. If a request for withdrawal is denied because of insufficient days to<br/>fund the request, the District shall notify the unit member, in writing, of the reason<br/>for the denial.</p>
<p>Participants who are denied a withdrawal or whose withdrawal is not renewed, or<br/>who are terminated from the Bank, may, within ten (10) days of denial, appeal in<br/>writing to the Board of Education. The Board shall hold a hearing in closed session<br/>within fifteen (15) workdays and issue a confidential written decision within fifteen<br/>(15) workdays of the hearing. If the unit member’s incapacitation does not allow<br/>participation in this appeal process, the unit member’s agent or member of the<br/>immediate family may attend the hearing. Approval or denial of catastrophic leave<br/>requests shall be final and not subject to grievance.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity</p>
<p>Up to seven (7) days of earned sick leave per year may be used for reasons of “Personal<br/>Necessity” as defined below. Personal Necessity leave may be utilized for family or personal<br/>emergencies, or special situations, when the member’s presence is urgently required, as<br/>opposed to situations where the particular matter could be taken care of during non-school<br/>hours. Such situations are those that could not be avoided by a prudent person through</p>
<p>planning. Something that would be easier to do, but not necessary to do during the normal<br/>workday, would not be considered Personal Necessity. The member shall not be required to<br/>explain the reason(s) for which said leave will be used on the Certificated Leave Request<br/>Form. Verbal verification may be required from the unit member by his/her immediate<br/>supervisor. The form will be signed by the member’s immediate supervisor and forwarded to<br/>the superintendent or his/her designee. The term “Personal Necessity” shall include the<br/>following situations:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious illness or injury of a member of the unit member’s immediate family. For<br/>purposes of this provision, immediate family means spouse, domestic partner, children,<br/>parents, brothers, sisters, parents-in-law, sons and/or daughters-in-law, or<br/>grandparents, grandchildren, or any relative living in the immediate household of the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving the member’s personal property or that of his/her immediate<br/>family.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appearance in court as a witness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or litigant.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child-rearing issues.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other situations where the member’s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presence is urgently required.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally Compelling</p>
<p>Up to two (2) days per year of the seven (7) Personal Necessity days may be used for<br/>other personal reasons deemed by the member as Personally Compelling.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member must request and receive written approval 2 weeks in<br/>advance from his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally Compelling days may not be used for recreation, vacation, or<br/>hobbies. Regarding hobbies, an exception may be allowed to enable a<br/>certificated unit member to participate in a significant event that cannot<br/>otherwise be accommodated during a school day. This is intended to be<br/>an exceptional request and is not intended to allow repeated participation<br/>in such events.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally Compelling days may not be used for earning extra income.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesson plans for the substitute teacher must be in place two (2) days<br/>ahead of the leave.</p>
<p>g. Under circumstances of catastrophic illness or injury of a family member (as</p>
<p>defined in Article VI,A,5) unit members may request to access more than seven (7) days<br/>of earned sick leave per year. Requests will be submitted for consideration to the<br/>Superintendent and Association President. If the Superintendent and Association<br/>President mutually agree to either approve or disapprove the request, the matter is<br/>settled. Whenever the Superintendent and Association President disagree, the matter<br/>will be referred to the Board of Education for a final decision.</p>
<p>B. EMERGENCY LEAVE</p>
<p>A certificated unit member may be granted by the principal or site administrator an emergency leave<br/>of up to three (3) days each school year with full pay when serious illness or accident happens to a<br/>member of the immediate family or necessary surgery for such a member is performed and the<br/>surgeon requests the presence of the unit member.</p>
<p>Emergency leaves granted under this provision are not cumulative from year to year, and this leave is<br/>not to be subtracted from sick leave. The District may require verification by the attending physician.</p>
<p>C. BEREAVEMENT LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement leave, without loss of pay, shall be granted up to three (3) days, five (5) days if<br/>over three hundred (300) miles, in the event of death of a member of an immediate family.<br/>Members of the immediate family shall include: the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather,<br/>or grandchild of the unit member or the unit member’s spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter,<br/>daughter-in-law, brother, or sister; or any relative living in the unit member’s immediate<br/>household. (Education Code 44985, 45194).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement leave to attend the funeral of a close family friend or relative, not a member of<br/>the immediate family, may be granted for the time necessary to attend the funeral; up to one-<br/>half (1/2) day if the funeral is on the Monterey Peninsula and up to one (1) full day if the funeral<br/>is out of the immediate area.</p>
<p>D. JURY DUTY</p>
<p>The following provision shall prevail in the event a certificated unit member of the District is called to</p>
<p>serve as a juror in a court during a period in which the unit member is on duty:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall receive his/her rate of pay for any day of jury duty which occurs on a<br/>normal work day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall endorse and present to the District any warrants which represent<br/>payments for jury duty.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a substitute teacher has been hired to replace the teacher who is released early</p>
<p>from jury duty, the substitute shall be retained for the complete day to maintain the classroom<br/>or accomplish other tasks as assigned by the principal.</p>
<p>E. EXTENDED ILLNESS OR INJURY LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an unit member is absent from his/her duties on account of illness or accident for a<br/>period of five (5) school months or less, after exhaustion of accumulated sick leave, the<br/>amount due to the unit member for any month in which the absence occurs shall be fifty<br/>percent (50%) of the unit member's regular salary.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five (5) month period shall run</p>
<p>consecutively.</p>

<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATERNITY LEAVE</p>
<p>A father shall be permitted time off with no loss of pay up to a total of two (2) day's absence. Such<br/>leaves may be taken during the birth and/or at the time of discharge from the hospital.</p>

<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT - JOB SHARING PLAN</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing is a plan whereby two (2) certificated teachers of the District share the full<br/>teaching responsibilities for one (1) identifiable full-time classroom position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in job sharing requires four (4) full teaching years within the District within<br/>the last seven (7) years.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the job sharing plan can be implemented there must be mutual agreement among the<br/>two (2) teachers, the building principal, District Superintendent, and the Board of Education.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any participant approved for and assigned to a job sharing plan shall become a part-time<br/>teacher in the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faculty meeting attendance is required unless excused by the principal.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participating unit member's benefits (medical, dental, and vision, and sick leave credit)<br/>shall be pro-rated.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries shall be computed in accordance with Article II, Section B.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and unit member contributions to STRS will be pro-rated.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salaries of the participants will be paid on a basis that is proportional to full-time service.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revision or termination of a job sharing plan will not modify or affect any vested unit member<br/>rights acquired prior to or during participation in the program, except that a teacher<br/>withdrawing from a job sharing plan or displaced if the plan is terminated by the Board, may be<br/>re-assigned to a regular full-time position, if available. Such teacher(s) shall have preference<br/>over temporary teachers only.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one of the teachers in the job sharing plan resigns, retires, dies, or goes on leave or returns<br/>to other full-time employment, the remaining teacher may have the option of recruiting a<br/>partner to be approved by the Superintendent or taking the position full-time.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other advantages pertaining to unit members not expressly modified within this</p>
<p>Article shall be retained under the terms of this Agreement and shall be made available to unit<br/>members participating in job sharing plans.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement or contract for one-half (1/2) time service shall be executed by the member<br/>and the employer, in writing, prior to the period of reduced service, before March 1 for the<br/>beginning of the school year, or before October 15 for the beginning of the second half of the<br/>school year. A unit member currently on the job sharing plan shall notify the District prior to<br/>March 1 if he/she wishes to continue in the job sharing program for the following year.</p>
<p>L. EXCHANGE TEACHING LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exchange leave is a leave granted to permit a teacher to serve as an exchange<br/>teacher in a foreign country or in any state, territory, or possession of the United States.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange leave of absence may be granted to certificated unit members who meet the<br/>following requirements.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members must have permanent status in this District on the effective date of leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members must have rendered full-time service in a certificated position for at least<br/>one (1) year immediately preceding the leave.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must be a superior teacher and an excellent representative of the<br/>United States and Carmel Unified School District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for exchange leave shall be made in writing and be presented to the building principal<br/>for his/her review and recommendation. The request shall be submitted to the District Office<br/>by April 1 of the year prior to the year for which the leave is requested.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaves other than those arranged through the Federal Government, the District teacher must<br/>ascertain from the other district its willingness to participate in the exchange. When such a<br/>district is found, the CUSD unit member shall notify the District Office and send the necessary<br/>papers to the other district. These papers shall be returned to the District Office on or before<br/>May 1. When all arrangements have been approved, the contract will be negotiated by the<br/>District Office.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants from CUSD will be evaluated by the Association and referred to the superintendent<br/>and Board of Education.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants from other districts will be evaluated and approved by the superintendent and Board<br/>of Education based on reference forms and other appropriate means, including personal<br/>interview if possible.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Exchange Agreement must be signed by the unit members and the districts concerned.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange is for one (1) year unless extended for one (1) additional year by unanimous<br/>consent of the Boards of Education and the unit members concerned.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation, including fringe benefits, shall be arranged according to one of the following</p>
<p>plans:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan A - The CUSD unit member is paid by the other district and will receive the rate of<br/>pay on the other district salary schedule which is nearest to the rate received in the<br/>CUSD, but not more than the other district unit member would have received.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan B - Applies to exchanges outside of California. The CUSD unit member is paid by<br/>the CUSD at his/her regular rate. This plan is limited to exchanges with states or<br/>countries where the other teacher will receive an adequate salary for living in this<br/>community.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan C - Applies to exchanges outside of California. The CUSD unit member is paid by<br/>the other district at a negotiated rate. Since this plan allows the outside unit member to<br/>be paid by the CUSD and to be placed on the District salary schedule, there are wider<br/>opportunities for working out exchange agreements.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for service on exchange leave counts toward advancement on the salary schedule as if<br/>such service were given in the District, provided that the unit member serves a sufficient<br/>number of days in the exchange position to have been paid at least seventy-five percent (75%)<br/>of the salary agreed to in the contract signed with the outside district. A notarized affidavit<br/>shall be filed certifying this service.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service on an exchange leave grants credit toward retirement. If retirement contributions are<br/>not deducted from compensation, the unit member must personally arrange for payment of<br/>required contributions.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) year on an exchange leave counts toward the seven (7) year service required for<br/>sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CUSD unit member and the exchange unit member shall be covered by the existing health<br/>and accident program.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the completion of any exchange, the CUSD unit member shall return to duty in the District<br/>and shall serve full-time for at least two (2) consecutive years before being eligible for another<br/>exchange teaching assignment.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to service in the District, the Board may require the CUSD unit member to<br/>submit to a physical examination (at the Board's expense). If so requested, the unit member<br/>shall present evidence provided by a licensed physician as to his/her health and physical<br/>fitness.</p>
<p>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may request the Association to review his/her case if a leave request is denied. The<br/>Association may represent the unit member in an appeal action if it deems the case merits<br/>further negotiations.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MILITARY LEAVE</p>
<p>Unit members shall be entitled to such leaves of absence with pay and other benefits as are provided</p>
<p>and allowed in Division II, Part I, Chapter VII of the Military and Veterans' Code, Section 389, et. seq.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT OR INDUSTRIAL ILLNESS LEAVE</p>
<p>Industrial accident or industrial illness leave is granted to an individual as a result of a job-related</p>
<p>accident or illness and is in addition to regularly accrued sick leave.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Allowable industrial accident or industrial illness leave with pay shall not exceed sixty</p>
<p>(60) working days in any one (1) fiscal year for the same accident or illness.</p>
<p>b. When an industrial accident or industrial illness occurs at a time when the full sixty (60)<br/>days will overlap into the next fiscal year, the unit member shall be entitled to only that<br/>amount remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the injury occurred, for the same<br/>accident or illness.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable industrial accident or industrial illness leave shall not be accumulative from year to<br/>year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or industrial illness leave shall commence on the first day of<br/>absence.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment for wages lost on any day, when added to an award granted the unit member under<br/>Workers' Compensation laws of this State, shall not exceed the unit member's actual wage if<br/>he/she were on the job.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or industrial illness leave will be reduced by one (1) day for each day of<br/>authorized absence, regardless of a compensation award made under Workers'<br/>Compensation.</p>
<p>6. Entitlement to this leave will be based upon finding that the disability has been due to industrial<br/>accident or industrial illness. In such case, regular sick leave will not be deducted for absence<br/>due to the industrial accident or industrial illness until the full sixty (60) days, if granted, has<br/>been exhausted.</p>
<p>O. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVES</p>
<p>The Association may be granted up to fifteen (15) days of leave each school year, to utilize for local,<br/>state, or national conferences, or for conducting other business pertinent to Association affairs.

These<br/>representatives may be excused from school duties upon two (2) days advance notification to the<br/>superintendent by the Association President. The length of the leave is to be determined<br/>cooperatively by the superintendent and the unit member. Each such officer shall be limited to four</p>
<p>(4) days of leave per year for these purposes.</p>
<p>Q. RELEASE TIME FOR DISTRICT PURPOSE</p>
<p>Certificated unit members may be released from duty at no loss in pay to attend professional<br/>meetings, appear in court in behalf of the District, or participate in other professional or educational<br/>activities that will benefit the Carmel Unified School District.</p>
<p>All such paid leaves shall be approved by the Superintendent. Such release time shall be kept to a<br/>minimum for each individual so that the instructional program of the District will be disrupted as little<br/>as possible. Generally, such leaves will be limited to no more than three (3) days per year for each<br/>unit member.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>SAFETY CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALLEGED VIOLATIONS</p>

<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best interest of the District</p>
<p>D. RELOCATION PROCESS</p>
<p>The District recognizes that relocation from one classroom to another requires an extra time<br/>commitment on the part of the teacher. Relocation occurs when a teacher is required to vacate a<br/>workspace and re-establish that workspace in another location. Relocation may occur as a result of<br/>a transfer, a reassignment, or the need to vacate a workspace. The District will make every attempt<br/>to give timely notification of relocation. Once teachers are notified of their relocation, they will meet<br/>with the site administrator to formulate a transition plan, including the compensation option stated<br/>below. This plan will include a timeline, and the assistance and materials that the district will provide<br/>for the move. Sufficient boxes for packing will be provided in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A. There are three options for compensation for relocation to be determined by the principal. Full<br/>time teachers (1.0 FTE) will be entitled to:</p>
<p>For Elementary Level Teachers:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to three (3) days of stipend at the hourly teacher rate; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to three (3) days of release time; or</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a combination of the above (whole days only)</p>
<p>For Secondary Level Teachers:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to two (2) days of stipend at the hourly teacher rate; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to two (2) days of release time; or</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a combination of the above (whole days only)</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An allowance of up to one additional day may be made by the principal for classrooms<br/>that require an extraordinary amount of packing</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time teachers will receive the percentage of the selected option that corresponds to the<br/>percentage of full time equivalency.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals will select one of the above-listed compensation options at least two weeks prior to<br/>the scheduled move date by noting it on the Pre-Move Designation form.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher chooses not to pack, he/she must notify the District via the pre-Move Designation<br/>form no later than two weeks before the scheduled move. In such cases, District personnel will<br/>pack the classroom materials. Teachers who do not pack their own classroom materials will<br/>not be eligible for stipends or release time related to the move.</p>
<p>E. Teachers must get their principal’s prior approval when scheduling their release day(s). When<br/>deciding whether to approve a requested release day, the principal will communicate with the<br/>Personnel Office to determine if there is adequate substitute availability.</p>

<p>Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended<br/>period of time, hereby defined as not less than ten (10) consecutive duty days, or that incapacitates a member of the<br/>employee’s immediate family that requires the employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time [ten<br/>(10) consecutive days] to care for that family member.</p>
<p>Participants who have exhausted regular sick leave, but still have differential leave available to them, shall be eligible<br/>for the catastrophic leave program credits. The District shall pay the participant full pay, and the credits shall be<br/>charged at one-half (1/2) day of sick leave for each day of absence.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this program, immediate family means spouse, domestic partner, or child. Requests to use<br/>catastrophic leave for a family member other than the employee’s immediate family will be submitted for consideration<br/>to the Superintendent and Association President If the Superintendent and Association President mutually agree to<br/>either approve or disapprove the request, the matter is settled. Whenever the Superintendent and Association President</p>
<p>disagree, the matter will be referred to the Board of Education for a final decision.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations to the Sick Leave Bank</p>
<p>The District shall establish a Sick Leave Bank to which all imit members may donate one (1) day of their<br/>earned and unused sick leave days. This donation shall be irrevocable, and shall be accomplished by the unit<br/>member filing a Sick Leave Donation Form (see Appendix F) prior to October 1 of the school year or within<br/>thirty (30) days of employment.

A donation to the Sick Leave Bank shall be a general<br/>donation and shall not be donated to a specific employee for his or her exclusive use.</p>
<p>Participation is voluntary', but requires a donation to the Bank. Only donors will be permitted to withdraw<br/>from the Bank. Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first becoming eligible<br/>must wait until die next open enrollment period and are not eligible to withdraw horn the Bank until they are<br/>enrolled.</p>

For<br/>employees who did not donate during the initial enrollment period, the Bank will reopen every' three (3) years.<br/>Existing participants will not be asked to donate unless the Bank has fallen below ninety (90) days. New<br/>employees will be offered the opportunity to participate in die Catastrophic Leave Program regardless of the<br/>number of days in the Bank.

<p>Any participating unit member who does not have earned and unused sick leave available when a donation<br/>period occurs shall be allowed to continue in the program until he or she lias earned additional sick leave. At<br/>that point, the donation will be automatically deducted from the unit member’ s accrued sick leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Bank</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Program participants who are in danger of exhausting their sick leave may apply to<br/>withdraw from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury (see Sick Leave Request Form; Appendix F). Unit<br/>members must use all sick leave, but not differential leave, available to them before being eligible for a<br/>withdrawal from the Bank.

<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK<br/>SICK LEAVE DONATION FORM</p>
<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK: SICK LEAVE DONATION FORM</p>
<p>The purpose of the catastrophic leave program is to permit employees to donate to a CATASTROPHIC<br/>leave bank (CLB) that will be used to support an employee when that employee, or a member of his or<br/>her immediate family, suffers from a catastrophic illness or injury, and the employee has exhausted all<br/>sick leave and other paid leave options. The CLB, while supporting your colleagues, also acts like an<br/>insurance policy for you, in case of unforeseen events.</p>
<p>Donated Sick leave days are irrevocably given to the Catastrophic Leave Bank and cannot be<br/>rescinded for any reason whatsoever. A donation to the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be a general<br/>donation and shall not be donated to a specific employee for his or her exclusive use.</p>
<p>Only donors will be permitted to withdraw from the CLB. Unit members who elect not to join the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first becoming eligible must wait until the next open enrollment period<br/>and are not eligible to withdraw from the Bank until they are enrolled.</p>
<p>Donations will be accepted during a thirty (30) day period beginning September 1 of each school year.<br/>The donation period will not occur in any year in which the Bank contains ninety (90) or more days.<br/>For employees who did not donate during the initial enrollment period, the Bank will reopen every<br/>three (3) years. Existing participants will not be asked to donate unless the Bank has fallen below<br/>ninety (90) days.</p>
<p>Participating unit members shall make a donation each time a donation period is opened until such time<br/>that a unit member notifies the Human Resources Office in writing of his or her desire to cancel<br/>participation. The unit member shall not be eligible to draw from the bank as of the effective date of<br/>the cancellation.</p>
<p>I,</p>
<p>a □ Certificated &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classified&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee,</p>
<p>do hereby donate one (1) day of my accumulated Sick Leave to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>I understand that this contribution is irrevocable and waive my right to appeal this decision to any<br/>court, administrative agency or arbitrator.</p>
