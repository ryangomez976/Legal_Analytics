<p>Management Rights</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association understands and agrees that consistent with the laws of the State<br/>of California, the rights, powers, prerogatives, and authority to manage, control,<br/>and direct the operations and affairs of the District are reserved exclusively to the<br/>District and the Board of Trustees, except as specifically limited, or modified by<br/>this Agreement or as otherwise provided by the parties.</p>
<p>6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention of the parties in setting forth the above-mentioned rights of<br/>management to detract or diminish in any way the rights of the Association or of<br/>unit members as expressly set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. It is the Parties'<br/>intention that the clear and explicit provisions of the other articles of this<br/>Agreement constitute the only contractual limitations upon the District's rights.</p>
<p>6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other rights of management, not expressly limited by the language of this<br/>Agreement, are also expressly reserved to the District, even though not numerated<br/>above. The exercise of any right reserved to the District herein in the particular<br/>manner, or the non-exercise of any such right, shall not be deemed a waiver of the<br/>District's right or preclude the District from exercising the right in a different<br/>manner.</p>
<p>6.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a direct conflict between the rights set forth in this article and the<br/>provisions of another article of this Agreement, the language of the latter shall<br/>prevail.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>7.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure at the lowest possible administrative<br/>level, equitable solutions to the problems which may from time to time arise<br/>affecting the welfare or working conditions of unit members and the Association.<br/>Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential<br/>as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the formal grievance procedure will preclude a bargaining unit<br/>member from scheduling an informal conference with his/her supervisor, the<br/>Superintendent or designee, or communicating in writing with the Board of<br/>Trustees if the unit member has a problem or complaint. The bargaining unit<br/>member may be accompanied by a representative of the Association if the unit<br/>member so chooses.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance is defined as a written complaint by a bargaining unit member, a<br/>group of bargaining unit members or the Association that there has been a<br/>violation or misinterpretation of this Agreement. Days is defined as any day on<br/>which the central administrative offices of the District are open for business. It is<br/>the intent of the parties to equitably resolve grievances at the lowest possible<br/>level.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure:</p>
<p>Step I: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty (20) days following knowledge of the act or</p>
<p>condition which is the basis for the grievance, a bargaining unit member, a group<br/>of unit members, or the Association may file a grievance in writing with the<br/>appropriate immediate supervisor. An informal meeting may be held between the<br/>grievant and supervisor before the formal process begins. Within ten (10) days of</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>the date the grievance is filed, the supervisor will communicate his/her decision to<br/>the grievant in writing.</p>
<p>Step II: If no response has been received or the grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>decision at Step I, he/she may appeal in writing to the Superintendent or designee<br/>within ten (10) days following the last date for response from Step I. The<br/>Superintendent or designee will, within ten (10) days from receipt of the appeal,<br/>respond to the grievant in writing.</p>
<p>Step III: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response has been received or the grievant is not satisfied</p>
<p>with the decision at Step II, he/she may request in writing that the Association<br/>submit his/her grievance to arbitration within ten (10) days following the last date<br/>for response from Step II. Within ten (10) days following receipt of such request,<br/>the Association may notify the Superintendent or designee in writing that the<br/>grievance is being submitted to arbitration under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration<br/>Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The parties may attempt to<br/>choose a mutually satisfactory arbitrator. If, however, the parties cannot agree<br/>upon the choice of an arbitrator within ten (10) days, they will file a request with<br/>the California Conciliation and Mediation Service to receive a list of five (5)<br/>names of people who are willing to serve as arbitrator. The parties will then each<br/>alternately strike one name from the list until one name remains.</p>
<p>The order of striking will be determined by lot. The grievance will then be<br/>submitted to the arbitrator. The submitted documents will state the issue(s) and<br/>propose a remedy. The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth<br/>the findings of fact and conclusions of law. The arbitrator will be without power<br/>or authority to recommend any decision which requires the commission of any act<br/>prohibited by law or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement. However,<br/>it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to include in any award, such<br/>financial reimbursement as he/she judges to be proper. The decision of the<br/>arbitrator will be submitted to the Superintendent or designee and the Association<br/>and be final and binding upon the parties.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous - No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or<br/>designee or by any member or representative of the administration or the Board<br/>against any bargaining unit member, any party in interest, any member of the<br/>Association or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such<br/>participation.</p>
<p>A bargaining unit member may be represented at all stages of the grievance<br/>procedure, prior to arbitration, by himself/herself, his/her designee, or, at his/her<br/>option, by a representative selected by the Association. The Association will be<br/>entitled to represent any grievant at the arbitration level. If a bargaining unit<br/>member is not represented by the Association or its representative, the<br/>Association will have the right to receive a copy of the grievance and any<br/>proposed resolution and to state its view before the grievance is resolved at all<br/>stages of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at a level above the principal or immediate supervisor, the<br/>aggrieved bargaining unit member will submit such grievance in writing to the<br/>Superintendent or designee and the Association directly and the processing of<br/>such grievance will be commenced at Step II. The Association may process such</p>

<p>a grievance through all levels of the grievance procedure even though the<br/>aggrieved bargaining unit member does not wish to do so.</p>
<p>When it is necessary for a representative designated by the Association to<br/>investigate a grievance or attend a grievance meeting or hearing during the day,<br/>he/she will, upon notice to his/her principal or immediate supervisor by the<br/>president of the Association or designee, be released without loss of pay in order<br/>to permit participation in the foregoing activities. Any bargaining unit member<br/>who is requested to appear in such investigation, meetings or hearings as a<br/>witness will be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will be maintained in the<br/>personnel office. No grievance records will be kept in the personnel file of a<br/>bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents, will be prepared jointly by the<br/>Superintendent or designee and the Association so as to facilitate operation of the<br/>grievance procedure. The costs of preparing such forms will be borne equally by<br/>both parties.</p>
<p>All costs of the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expense, travel and<br/>subsistence, will be borne equally by both parties.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8</p>
<p>Personnel Files</p>
<p>Any person or persons who draft and/or place materials in a bargaining unit<br/>member’s personnel file will sign the material and signify the date on which such<br/>material was drafted and placed in the file.</p>
<p>The disposition of material in a bargaining unit member’s personnel file is to be<br/>governed by the provisions of Education Code Section 44031 which states:<br/>Materials in personnel files of bargaining unit members which may serve as a<br/>basis for affecting the status of their employment are to be made available for the<br/>inspection by the person involved.</p>
<p>Such material is not to include ratings, reports, or records which (1) were obtained<br/>prior to the employment of the person involved, (2) were prepared by identifiable<br/>examination committee members, or (3) were obtained in connection with a<br/>promotional examination.</p>
<p>Every bargaining unit member will have the right to inspect such materials upon<br/>request, provided that the request is made at a time when such person is not<br/>actually required to render service to the employing district.</p>
<p>Information of a derogatory nature, except material mentioned in the second<br/>paragraph of this section, will not be entered or filed in the personnel file unless<br/>and until the bargaining unit member is given notice and an opportunity to review<br/>and comment thereon. Such material will be added in a timely fashion. A<br/>bargaining unit member will have the right to enter, and have attached to any such<br/>derogatory statement, his/her own comments thereon. Such review will take<br/>place during normal business hours, and the bargaining unit member will be<br/>released from duty for this purpose without salary reduction.</p>

<p>The Superintendent, or a designated confidential representative, will be<br/>responsible for maintaining a log attached to each personnel file which indicates<br/>access to the file. The log will include the specific reason the file was accessed,<br/>the date of access, and the signature of the person accessing the file.</p>
<p>Upon written authorization by the bargaining unit member, a representative of the<br/>Association will be permitted to examine and/or obtain copies of materials in such<br/>unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>Access to personnel files will be limited to the members of the District<br/>administration on a need-to-know basis. Board of Trustees members may request<br/>the review of a bargaining unit member’s file at a personnel session of the entire<br/>Board of Trustees. The contents of all personnel files will be kept in the strictest<br/>confidence.</p>
<p>The District will maintain the bargaining unit member’s personnel file at the<br/>District central office. A bargaining unit member’s file kept by their immediate<br/>supervisor will be accessible to the bargaining unit member or Association<br/>representative. Copies of such documents will be made available upon request.<br/>Upon the transfer of a unit member to another site, all supervisor’s files will be<br/>forwarded to the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel for review and<br/>disposition.</p>
<p>Four years following a signed, written, proven public complaint against a<br/>bargaining unit member, at the request of the unit member, all copies of the<br/>material relative to the complaint will be placed in a sealed envelope inside the<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>Complaints From the Public</p>
<p>Any signed written complaint about a bargaining unit member will be reported<br/>within five (5) working days to the unit member by the administrator receiving<br/>the complaint. If the complaint is to be placed in the unit member’s personnel<br/>file, an investigation will be completed within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>Should the involved bargaining unit member believe that the allegations in the<br/>complaint are sufficiently serious to warrant a meeting, the immediate supervisor<br/>will schedule a meeting with the unit member and the complainant. At the request<br/>of the bargaining unit member, an Association representative may be present at<br/>the meeting. If the complainant does not appear at the meeting and does not have<br/>a reasonable excuse, the complaint is dismissed.</p>
<p>Any unsubstantiated complaint will not be placed in the bargaining unit member’s<br/>personnel file. The Board will not dismiss or refuse to re-employ a bargaining<br/>unit member on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.</p>
<p>Administrators have the responsibility to review parental complaints with<br/>bargaining unit members within the framework of meeting the needs of students,<br/>parents and unit members. They have the obligation to support bargaining unit<br/>members when charges are unfounded, to help the communication process when<br/>misunderstandings occur and to help correct problems which are referred.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 9</p>
<p>Professional Dues and Payroll Deductions</p>
<p>Any bargaining unit member who is a member of the Association, or who has<br/>applied for membership, may sign and deliver to the Board an assignment<br/>authorizing deduction of unified member dues, initiation fees and general<br/>assessments assessed by the Association. Such authorization will continue in<br/>effect from year-to-year and may not be revoked. Pursuant to such authorization,<br/>the District will deduct one-tenth of such dues from the regular salary check of the<br/>bargaining unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for<br/>bargaining unit members who sign such authorization after the commencement of<br/>the school year will be prorated to complete payments by the end of the school<br/>year.</p>
<p>Any bargaining unit member, within thirty (30) days from the date of<br/>commencement of assigned duties, will become a member of STA/CTA/NEA, or<br/>pay to the Association a fee in an amount equal to unified membership dues,<br/>initiation fees and general assessments, payable to the Association in one lump<br/>sum cash payment in the same manner as required for the payment of membership<br/>dues. However, the unit member may authorize payroll deduction for such fee in<br/>the same manner as provided in paragraph 9.0. In the event that a bargaining unit<br/>member will not pay such fee directly to the Association, or authorize payment<br/>through payroll deduction as provided in paragraph 9.0 the Association will so<br/>inform the District, and the District will immediately begin automatic payroll<br/>deduction as provided in Education Code Section 45061 and in the same manner<br/>as set forth in paragraph 9.0. There will be no charge to the Association for such<br/>mandatory agency fee deductions.</p>
<p>Any bargaining unit member who is a member of a religious body whose<br/>traditional tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially<br/>supporting employee organizations will not be required to join or financially<br/>support STA/CTA/NEA as a condition of employment; except that such unit<br/>member will pay, in lieu of a service fee, sums equal to such service fee to one of<br/>the non-religious, non-labor organization charitable funds exempt from taxation<br/>under section 501 (c)(3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such payment<br/>will be made on or before October 1, of each school year.</p>
<p>Proof of payment and a written statement of objection to joining or to financially<br/>supporting employee organizations will be made on an annual basis to the<br/>Association and District as a condition of continued exemption from the<br/>provisions of paragraphs two (2) and three (3) above. Proof of payment will be in<br/>the form of receipts and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of<br/>payment, and to whom payment in lieu of the service fee has been made. Such<br/>proof will be presented on or before October 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to paragraphs 9.0 and</p>
<p>9.1 whether for membership dues or agency fee, the District agrees to promptly<br/>remit such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit<br/>members for whom such deductions have been made, categorizing them as to<br/>membership or non-membership in the Association, and indicating any changes in<br/>personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Hold Harmless Clause</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to pay to the District all reasonable legal fees and<br/>legal costs incurred in defending against any court action and/or<br/>administrative action before the Public Employment Relations Board<br/>challenging the legality or constitutionality of the agency fee provisions of<br/>the Agreement or their implementation.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine<br/>whether any such action or proceeding referred to in Paragraph A (above)<br/>shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10</p>

<p>9</p>
<p>Minimum Days</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All minimum days will be standardized to 240 minutes for grades Kindergarten<br/>through Sixth Grade.

At the beginning of each school year, every bargaining unit<br/>member will receive a sick leave allotment credit equal to his or her sick leave<br/>entitlement for the school year. A bargaining unit member may use his or her<br/>credited sick leave at any time during the school year. If a bargaining unit<br/>member is terminated and has used more sick leave days than were earned, the<br/>amount used, but not earned, will be deducted from his or her final warrant.</p>
<p>It is imperative that the District be notified through the Automated Substitute<br/>System of an absence from the classroom. This notification must be made prior<br/>to one hour prior to the start of school. The Automated Substitute System may be<br/>notified up to one year in advance of a known absence. Upon calling the<br/>Automated Substitute System, you must enter a start date and end date of the<br/>absence. The principal may request the bargaining unit member to estimate the<br/>number of illness days. In the event no sick days remain, a substitute will be<br/>hired for the following day and bargaining unit member’s salary reduced by any<br/>money necessary to pay the substitute.</p>
<p>Unused sick leave will accrue from school year to school year. There is no limit<br/>to the number of sick days that will be accrued. New bargaining unit members<br/>with accumulated sick leave from other California school districts may transfer</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated and unused sick leave of certificated bargaining unit members will<br/>be counted as service credit for purposes of computing length of service for<br/>retirement benefits under the State Teachers Retirement System.</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Superintendent of Personnel or designee may require a doctor’s<br/>release prior to returning to work for the following reasons:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worker’s compensation case</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disability or illness including pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth</p>
<p>Workers Compensation Leave</p>

<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member will report a personal injury which occurs at<br/>school to the site administrator or designee as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of the bargaining unit member’s temporary disability indemnity<br/>and the portion of salary due him or her during his or her absence will equal<br/>his or her full salary.</p>
<p>(C) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided in this paragraph are in addition to sick leave benefits.<br/>The Board will not deduct accumulated sick leave from the sick leave<br/>allotment of a bargaining unit member who is absent as the result of an<br/>industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>Maternity Leave</p>
<p>13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will provide for leave of absence from duty for any certificated<br/>bargaining unit member of the District who is required to be absent from duties<br/>because of adoption, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom.<br/>The length of leave of absence, including the date on which the leave will<br/>commence and the date on which the bargaining unit member will resume duties,<br/>will be determined by the unit member and the unit member’s physician.<br/>Disabilities caused by or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and<br/>recovery therefrom are, for all job related purposes, temporary disabilities and<br/>will be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick<br/>leave plan available in connection with employment by any school district. All<br/>written employment policies of the District will be applied to disability due to<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom on the same terms and<br/>conditions applied to other temporary disabilities.</p>
<p>13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member will have the right to utilize sick leave for absences<br/>necessitated by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery therefrom. (See<br/>Article 18.17)</p>
<p>Family Care and Medical Leave</p>
<p>13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision for Family Care and Medical Leave will be applied in accordance with<br/>the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the California Family and<br/>Medical Leave Act of 1994. (See applicable Board Policy and Administrative<br/>Regulations).</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saugus Union School District Board of Trustees shall grant family care and<br/>medical leave to eligible employees in accordance with current federal and state<br/>law. Employees taking this leave shall be reinstated in the same or comparable</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who has served the district more than one continuous year shall be<br/>eligible to take unpaid family care and medical leave under the provisions of<br/>federal and state law.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>13.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition: A “catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, or that<br/>incapacitates an employee’s immediate family member (as identified in STA<br/>Agreement Article 13.0 “A”) and requires the employee to take time off from<br/>work for an extended period of time to care for that family member.</p>
<p>13.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation: All certificated employees are eligible to request Catastrophic<br/>Leave in accordance with this Article. Participants may request either leave from<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank (“Bank”) or may request Direct Donation Sick<br/>Leave (“Direct Donation”). Participants may also request to utilize their<br/>accumulated sick leave for family emergency situations. Participation is voluntary<br/>and requires a one-time donation of one (1) day to the Bank, to be deposited<br/>within the first sixty (60) calendar days of the school year in which an employee<br/>chooses to join or from the start of employment. No additional days are required<br/>for continued participation. Employees wishing to donate days must have a<br/>balance of at least five (5) days in their own sick leave account. Donated sick<br/>days will not affect an employee’s “perfect attendance” status.</p>
<p>A. Bank Participation</p>
<p>A maximum of three (3) days may be donated per year. Donations are<br/>irrevocable and must be in the employee’s full day equivalent, whatever<br/>their classification. Those employees donating days must submit a signed<br/>donation form to payroll. In the event the Bank is depleted and a specific<br/>need for additional days arises during the course of the school year, any<br/>certificated employee who presently has five or more days of earned and<br/>unused sick leave, who had not previously participated, may donate to the<br/>Bank and become a member of the Bank.</p>
<p>B. Direct Donation</p>
<p>Direct Donation days can only be requested/donated for current needs and<br/>may not be accumulated for future purposes. A maximum of two (2)<br/>Direct Donation days may be deposited by an employee each school year.<br/>A direct donation does not qualify the donator for eligibility in the Bank.</p>
<p>13.14 Participation Limitations: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exhausted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick leave,</p>
<p>which includes the exhaustion or denial of income protection, may apply for<br/>catastrophic illness or injury leave. The combined total number of Catastrophic<br/>Leave days (Bank plus Direct Donation) received shall be limited to a maximum<br/>of sixty (60) days in a two-year period with a lifetime maximum of 120 days.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank Withdrawals</p>
<p>Withdrawals from the Bank shall be granted in units of no more than 30<br/>workdays and may not be carried over to the following school year.<br/>Participants may submit requests for a one-time extension of a maximum<br/>of 30 days as their grant expires. Withdrawals will be made in increments<br/>of one day at a time, which reflects the employee’s regular work<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct Donation Requests</p>
<p>An employee wishing to receive Direct Donation Sick Leave must solicit<br/>donations on the Sick Leave Direct Donation form(s) and submit<br/>completed forms to personnel prior to, during, or within seven (7) days of<br/>return from leave. An employee may receive a maximum of eleven (11)<br/>Direct Donation days per school year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave Requests</p>
<p>An employee wishing to use more than their annual allotment of sick leave<br/>for family emergency situations may submit an application to the<br/>Catastrophic Review Committee for approval.</p>
<p>13.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review Committee: Catastrophic Leave shall be administered by a three (3)<br/>member committee, consisting of two teachers named by the Association, and one<br/>certificated administrator named by the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel, or<br/>Designee. The District Assistant Superintendent, Personnel, or Designee shall<br/>also serve on the committee as a non-voting member. Administration of the<br/>program will be through the Personnel Office.</p>
<p>13.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for Leave and Review Process:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;participant shall submit a</p>
<p>Certificated Catastrophic Leave Application for Bank withdrawal. Direct<br/>Donation days, and/or Sick Leave along with the Sick Leave Direct Donation<br/>form(s) if applicable to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel, or Designee, and<br/>provide verification of the catastrophic injury or illness. Verification shall be<br/>made by a letter, dated and signed by the sick or injured person’s physician,<br/>indicating the incapacitating nature and probable duration of the illness or injury.<br/>The Assistant Superintendent, Personnel, or Designee will then convene the<br/>committee, which will determine if the illness or injury meets the appropriate<br/>criteria and/or if additional verification is required.</p>
<p>13.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may apply to the Catastrophic Leave Committee to utilize their<br/>accumulated sick leave for family emergency situations consistent with<br/>Catastrophic Leave guidelines.</p>

<p>13.23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a bargaining unit member on a child rearing leave returns to the school<br/>system at any time other than the start of the school year, such unit member may<br/>be assigned to any position decided upon by the Superintendent or designee so<br/>long as such assignment is within the certification of such unit member, it being<br/>the purpose of such assignment not to interfere with or disrupt the instruction of<br/>the pupils, particularly when such pupils may have commenced their instruction<br/>with a teacher who was assigned to such pupils at the start of the school year.</p>
<p>13.24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, a request for a child rearing leave from<br/>a non tenured bargaining unit member need not be extended beyond the end of the<br/>contract school year in which the leave is obtained.</p>

A bargaining unit member will receive his/her regular<br/>pay. The bargaining unit member will reimburse the District the amount received<br/>from jury or witness fees.</p>
<p>13.30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member will be eligible to utilize any days of personal<br/>necessity to which the unit member may be entitled if the unit member is a litigant<br/>and must appear in court. The bargaining unit member will be entitled to unpaid<br/>leave after the exhaustion of personal necessity days or if the unit member elects<br/>not to use personal necessity days.</p>

<p>Inservice Leave</p>
<p>13.34 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member will, upon request to the principal, be entitled to<br/>inservice leave during the school year for the purpose of improving his/her<br/>performance when (1) he/she has received an unsatisfactory rating in an area of<br/>evaluation, or (2) when requested to implement a new program.</p>
<p>13.35 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other bargaining unit members who wish to enhance their programs will be<br/>entitled to utilize substitute time which has been allotted for that purpose.<br/>Procedures for allotting said substitute time will be determined by consensus of<br/>the principal and total teaching staff.</p>
<p>13.36 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to notify bargaining unit members at least 48 hours in<br/>advance of proposed inservice meetings.</p>
<p>Return from Unpaid and/or Child Rearing Leave</p>
<p>13.37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require bargaining unit members on leave to enter into an<br/>agreement requiring the unit member to return from leave on a designated day.</p>
<p>For bargaining unit members on full-year leaves, notification of intent to return<br/>must be submitted to the District on or before March 1 of that year. The District<br/>may require a bargaining unit member to submit a letter of resignation indicating<br/>that should the unit member not notify the District within 15 days of the<br/>designated day of return, or notify the District by March 1 if on full-year leave,<br/>the unit member shall be deemed to have voluntarily submitted his/her<br/>resignation. At least 15 days prior to the return date, or by February 15 if on a<br/>full-year leave, the District will send each bargaining unit member on leave a<br/>reminder notice to be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, of his/her<br/>obligation to notify the District of his/her intent to return. Nothing in this<br/>paragraph will preclude a bargaining unit member from requesting additional<br/>leave time prior to the end of a particular leave of absence. The District is not<br/>required to grant additional leave except as provided above.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>ARTICLE 14</p>

<p>By March 30, a faculty meeting will be held at each school to discuss possible<br/>grade-level assignments.</p>
<p>All teachers will know their school and grade-level assignments by the last day of<br/>school.

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers will be solicited</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary employees</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary employees (if the reduction occurs prior to the first observation<br/>of the first probationary year, otherwise they shall be excluded)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District seniority</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>The following additional criteria may also be used in conjunction with and/or to<br/>modify the above order</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CTC Credentials &amp; Certifications held</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience and special Qualifications</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level(s) affected</p>

Sec. 7801, and whose previous evaluation rated<br/>the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if the evaluator and certificated<br/>employee being evaluated agree. The certificated employee or the evaluator may<br/>withdraw consent at any time. Any changes to current statutory language would<br/>make the entire section null and void.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 16</p>
<p>Safety and Teaching Conditions</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members will not be required to work under unsafe conditions or<br/>to perform tasks which endanger their health, safety or well-being. If a<br/>bargaining unit member feels an unsafe condition exists, he/she will notify the<br/>building principal or designee.

The District will also<br/>pay a percentage of dental and vision premiums based on the age and years of<br/>service at retirement. Service and age requirements and percentage of premiums<br/>paid are as follows:</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each additional year of service above ten = 4%</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year of age over 55 at retirement, up to age 60 = 5%, not to exceed<br/>80%</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years service if the employee is at least 55 years old = 80%</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum insurance benefit available to bargaining unit members = 80%,<br/>except as indicated below:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five years of service if the employee is at least 58 years old = 90%</p>

The same percentage<br/>rates of premiums paid for retirees will be adjusted to the amount of cash<br/>retirees receive per year.</p>
<p>18.19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cash in Lieu of Benefits for Eligible Retirees</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees must request to participate in the Cash In Lieu program during the<br/>District's standard Open Enrollment Period</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cash In Lieu benefit will be earned at the same rate as the retiree’s<br/>earned prorated benefits entitlement (e.g. if an employee receives 40% of<br/>their medical cap, they will receive 40% of the negotiated Cash In Lieu<br/>benefit)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers retiring at the end of the school year will begin to accrue the Cash<br/>In Lieu benefit on September 1. Teachers retiring at any other time during<br/>the school year will begin to accrue the Cash In Lieu benefit on the first day<br/>of the second month following retirement (e.g. if an employee retires<br/>December 15, he/she will begin to accrue Cash In Lieu benefits on February</p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment will be made once a year in December</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cash In Lieu benefit will be taxable</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cash In Lieu of benefits will end when the retiree turns age 65</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Benefits Department will send a reminder notice to eligible retirees of<br/>the Open Enrollment Period</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Benefits Department will run a supplemental payroll run for the Cash In<br/>Lieu payment which will automatically generate a W-2</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a Qualifying Event, retirees can opt out of Cash In Lieu at any<br/>time during the year, but they can only switch into Cash In Lieu during the<br/>Open Enrollment Period</p>
<p>18.20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All district paid premiums will stop when members become eligible for Medicare<br/>or are 65 years of age, whichever comes first. However, medical and dental may<br/>be continued indefinitely at the bargaining unit member’s own expense.</p>
<p>Extension of Benefits</p>
<p>18.21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminated full-time employees and his/her enrolled dependents, have the right to<br/>pay for continued membership in District provided benefit plans under certain<br/>circumstances of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act<br/>(COBRA).</p>

<p>Evaluation Overview</p>
<p>Saugus Union School District has developed an evaluation system which meets requirements<br/>specified in the legislation and follow's standards w hich constitute a legal system of employee<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation system contains the components mandated by the Legislature and is in har¬<br/>mony with statutory procedural standards.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards for satisfactory performance are available to employees and are applied equally to<br/>all.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices of deficiencies are provided to employees in written form along with specific direc¬<br/>tions and assistance to improve unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p>The present instrument for the improvement of instruction is based on The California Stan¬<br/>dards for the Teaching Profession w hich are organized around the following six categories:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and Supporting All Students in Learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for All Students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing Student Learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a Professional Educator</p>
<p>The puipose of evaluation is to improve the quality of education prov ided to students. It is an<br/>ongoing process focused on the means by which each individual can more effectiv ely contribute<br/>to the educational effort of the District. It is based upon a fair and objective assessment of per¬<br/>formance.</p>
<p>Site Administrators are responsible for completing all evaluation documents. Teacher support<br/>programs which assist in the dev elopment of good teaching skills include: Beginning Teacher<br/>Support and Assessment (BTSA), Pre-intem, Intern, and Peer Assistance and Rev iew (PAR).</p>

<p>Professional Goals</p>
<p>Establish four professional goals yearly from the CSTP which must include three mutually<br/>agreed upon goals selected from Standards One through Five, plus, one goal from Standard Six.<br/>These will support the narrative on the Summative Evaluation. In a non-evaluation year the<br/>teacher will self-evaluate progress tow aid goals. Adjustment of goals may be made midyear if<br/>necessary.</p>

<p>Formal Observation Process</p>
<p>A pre-conference is held prior to a formal observation.</p>
<p>Formal observations are made according to the prescribed timelines and include a pre-observation<br/>conference, observation, and post-observation conference. To increase the reliability of the infor¬<br/>mation gained through the formal observation, the following procedure is required for all formal<br/>observations:</p>
<p>f A pre-observation conference held prior to the formal observation by the teacher and adminis¬<br/>trator to discuss:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanics of the observation - time, length and subject to be observed.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesson objectives</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher concerns</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background information</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A post-observation conference is held within five school days from the date of the formal ob¬<br/>servation to discuss:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengths and suggestions for improvement of the lesson.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target objectives, solutions, resources and assessment procedures.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future observations</p>
<p>4. The sunnnative evaluation is a compilation of at least two formal observations. The<br/>teacher will receive a copy of the completed observation form.</p>
<p>The summative evaluation, together with necessary support materials, is placed in the<br/>teacher’s personnel file. Prior to placement in the personnel file, and within twenty calendar<br/>days of receiving a copy of the summative evaluation, the teacher may attach a written com¬<br/>ment to the final evaluation.</p>
<p>Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) / Assistance Plans</p>
<p>The Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program identifies the areas of classroom management,<br/>instructional strategies, and student progress as critical components. The California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession align with those categories as follows:</p>
<p>Classroom management &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard 2</p>
<p>Instructional strategies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards f,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3, and 4</p>
<p>Student progress &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard 5</p>
<p>On the Summative Evaluation, an &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; rating in any category (Standards f-5) requires<br/>mandatory participation in PAR.</p>
<p>On the Summative Evaluation, two consecutive &quot;Needs to Improve&quot; in the same category (Stan¬<br/>dards f-5) requires mandatory participation in PAR</p>
