<p>ARTICLE X: GRIEVANCE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; shall mean a written alleged violation, misapplication, or misinterpretation<br/>of a specific provision of this Agreement which adversely affects the grievant.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; shall mean a unit member or group of unit members or the Association<br/>covered by this Agreement filing a grievance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;conferee&quot; shall mean an Association representative, an Association staff<br/>representative, or legal counsel approved by the Association in writing, selected by the<br/>grievant to assist him in presenting and processing his grievance. A unit member's<br/>immediate administrator, with whom a grievance is filed, may also choose a<br/>representative in processing grievances.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this article only, &quot;day&quot; means a day on which the administrative office<br/>of the Office of Education is open for business.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties agree that these proceedings will be kept confidential, and that the grievant<br/>and his immediate administrator should attempt to resolve the grievance at the informal<br/>level.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All materials concerning a unit member's grievance shall be kept in a confidential file<br/>separate from his personnel file.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a grievance shall in no way interfere with the rights of the Board and/or the<br/>Superintendent to proceed in carrying out their responsibilities subject to the final<br/>decision of the grievance. In the event the grievance involves an order, requirement, or<br/>other directive, the grievant shall fulfill or carry out such order, requirement, or other<br/>directive, pending the final decision of the grievance, unless it endangers the safety of<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any grievant to<br/>discuss a grievance informally with his immediate administrator, or to have the<br/>grievance adjusted, prior to Level IV without intervention of the Association, provided<br/>that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. Any proposed<br/>resolution at Level I, II, or III, shall not be agreed upon by the Office of Education until</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>the Association has been provided a copy, and has been allowed three (3) days for an<br/>opportunity in which to respond.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a case of multiple grievance claims on the same issue, the Office of Education may<br/>elect to hear only one written grievance filed, as determined by the Association, if any of<br/>the grievants are represented by the Association, and the decision rendered shall be<br/>applicable to all grievances filed on the same issue arising from the same set of<br/>circumstances.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a specific time period is provided for administrative decisions at each level of<br/>the grievance procedure, it is recognized that multiple grievance claims must be<br/>processed in a sequential manner. Consequently, at each level of the procedure,<br/>grievance claims shall be assigned consecutive numbers based upon the order in which<br/>they are received. Administrative personnel shall process such numbered grievances</p>
<p>in a sequential manner, following a pattern that first filed will be first considered, in a<br/>timely fashion. Regardless of specific time periods provided for decisions at the various<br/>levels of this procedure, administrative personnel shall not be required to consider more<br/>than one grievance claim per day.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who fails to comply with the time limits established in this procedure<br/>shall forfeit all rights to apply the grievance procedure for the alleged Agreement<br/>violations. Time lines may be extended by mutual written agreement. Also, the time<br/>lines would be extended upon request of the grievant who is on scheduled recess or<br/>approved leave. Failure by the administration to adhere to decision deadlines<br/>constitutes the right for the grievant to appeal automatically to the next higher step.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than one conferee of the grievant shall have the right to receive released time<br/>for the meetings and conferences specifically provided for herein.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any hearing at Level IV is scheduled during the day, any unit member required by<br/>either party to testify at the hearing shall be released from regular duties without loss of<br/>compensation. No more than two bargaining unit members may be on release time<br/>under this subsection at any one time unless their presence is required for immediate<br/>testimony at hearing.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With prior notification to the immediate administrator, designated Association officers<br/>and/or Association representatives shall be given reasonable_release time<sub>7</sub> in order to<br/>assist in the investigation and presentation of grievances.</p>
<p>K. The forms to be utilized in the grievance procedure shall be included in Appendix D of<br/>this agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Procedure<br/>Informal Level</p>
<p>The unit member shall meet with his immediate administrator to discuss the potential<br/>grievance in an attempt to resolve it informally. The grievant has the right to a representative<br/>at the informal level. If the potential grievance is not resolved at this level, the unit member<br/>may proceed to Level I. The Office of Education and the Association may mutually agree in<br/>writing to waive any level of the grievance procedure. The Office of Education and the<br/>Association agree that every effort will be made by management and the grievant to settle<br/>grievances at the lowest possible level.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Procedure</p>
<p>For purposes of Section 7.4 the required timelines shall begin on the first (1st) day following<br/>the date of receipt of a grievance by the Office of Education or the first (1st) day following<br/>receipt of the Office of Education decision by the grievant.</p>
<p>A. Level I</p>
<p>Within twenty-five (25) days of the occurrence, or within twenty-five (25) days of when<br/>the unit member could reasonably have known of the occurrence of the act or omission<br/>giving rise to the grievance, the grievant must present his grievance in writing utilizing<br/>the designated grievance form, included as Appendix “D” in this agreement to his/her<br/>immediate administrator. On this form the unit member shall make a clear and concise<br/>statement of the grievance, the circumstances involved, and the specific article(s) that<br/>was allegedly violated, the decision rendered at the informal conference, and the<br/>specific remedy sought. The immediate administrator shall communicate a decision to<br/>the unit member in writing within ten (10) days from the date the written grievance is<br/>received by the immediate administrator. If the immediate administrator does not<br/>respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level. Within the<br/>foregoing time limit either party may request a personal conference to discuss the<br/>grievance. Either the grievant or the immediate administrator may have a conferee<br/>present at such a conference.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>Level II</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the grievant may<br/>appeal the decision to the Division Administrator, within ten (10) days after receiving the<br/>decision at Level I. This written appeal statement shall include a copy of the original<br/>grievance, the decision rendered at Level I and a clear, concise statement of the<br/>reasons for the appeal. The parties shall convene a meeting to discuss the grievance<br/>within ten (10) days of the filing of the Level II documents. Either party may have a<br/>conferee present at such a conference. By mutual agreement of the parties, additional<br/>conferees may be present at the conference. The Division Administrator, or his/her<br/>designee, shall communicate a decision within ten (10) days from the date the Level II<br/>conference is held by the Division Administrator. If the Division Administrator, or his/her<br/>designee, does not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next<br/>level.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, the grievant may<br/>appeal the decision to the Superintendent, within ten (10) days after receiving the<br/>decision at Level II. The written appeal statement shall include a copy of the original<br/>grievance, the decisions rendered at previous levels, and a clear, concise statement of<br/>the reasons for the appeal. The parties shall convene a meeting to discuss the<br/>grievance within ten (10) days of the filing of the Level III documents. Either party may<br/>have two conferee(s) present at such a conference. By mutual agreement of the<br/>parties, additional conferees may be present at the conference. The Superintendent, or<br/>his/her designee, shall communicate a decision within ten (10) days from the date the<br/>conference is held by the Superintendent. If the Superintendent, or his/her designee,<br/>does not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV - Arbitration</p>
<p>In the event that the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level III, the unit<br/>member may request, in writing within five (5) days, that the Association submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration. If the Association agrees to proceed, the Association will<br/>request arbitration of the grievance in writing to the Office of Education within fifteen<br/>(15) days of the issuance of the Level III decision. Such request must be in writing and<br/>be accompanied by a written statement from the Association agreeing to take the<br/>grievance to arbitration. In electing to pursue the grievance through arbitration, the<br/>grievant and the Association thereby agree that the arbitration process shall be the only</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>forum for resolving the grievant's claim, that the arbitrator's decision shall be final and<br/>binding, and that they will not thereafter attempt to achieve a different resolution<br/>through a separate remedial procedure, whether established by statute or by regulation<br/>having the force of law.</p>
<p>No later than fifteen (15) days after the Office of Education's receipt of the request for<br/>arbitration from the Association, the Association and the Office of Education shall meet<br/>to determine a mutually acceptable arbitrator. In the event the Association and the<br/>Office of Education are unable to reach agreement on a mutually acceptable arbitrator,<br/>the Association shall request, within the same fifteen (15) day period, that the American<br/>Arbitration Association shall supply a listing of names pursuant to its rules. The<br/>Arbitrator selected must be a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators and must<br/>have recent experience in arbitration of grievances involving public school employers.</p>
<p>The Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association shall<br/>apply except where the specific language herein is in conflict, which specific language<br/>will prevail.</p>
<p>Any award of the arbitrator shall be binding on the grievant, the Association and the<br/>Office of Education.</p>
<p>It shall be the function of the arbitrator to make an award, if necessary, which will<br/>resolve the grievance. The arbitrator shall be subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, alter, subtract from, disregard,<br/>change, or modify any terms of this Agreement; but shall determine only whether<br/>or not there has been a violation, misapplication or misinterpretation of this<br/>Agreement in the respect alleged in the grievance.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to establish salary structures or change any<br/>salary.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The award of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and<br/>arguments presented to him/her in the presence of the parties, and upon any<br/>post-hearing briefs of the parties.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to change any practice, policy, or rule of the<br/>Office of Education; nor to substitute his judgment for that of the Office of<br/>Education as to the reasonableness of any such practice, policy, rule, or any</p>
<p>action by the Office of Education; nor to adjust, modify or amend salary<br/>schedules or classification structures.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard of review for the arbitrator is whether the Office of Education acted<br/>in an arbitrary and capricious manner which is a violation of the express terms of<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not consider any issue raised by the grievant unless it was<br/>made known in writing to the Office of Education in an earlier Level of this<br/>Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to recommend or resolve any of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The termination of services or any other disciplinary action or failure to re¬<br/>employ any member of the Unit.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any matter involving evaluation, except where procedure has been<br/>violated.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent or limit deferral to arbitration<br/>by the Public Employment Relations Board pursuant to Government Code<br/>Section 3541.5(a)(2)</p>
<p>(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Office of<br/>Education and the Association. The Office of Education shall only bear its own<br/>expenses. Arbitration hearings shall be held at the Office of Education, unless<br/>the parties mutually agree otherwise. If the Office of Education claims that a<br/>grievance should be dismissed because, for example, it falls outside the scope<br/>of the procedure, or was filed or processed in an untimely manner, such a claim<br/>shall, at the option of the Office of Education and upon reasonable notice, be<br/>heard and promptly ruled upon by the arbitrator prior to any hearing on the merits<br/>of the grievance. Upon the request of either party, there shall be a suitable<br/>stay/continuance between such a ruling and any further proceedings which may<br/>be necessary. The Office of Education may forego the above preliminary motion<br/>procedure, and have such a claim heard and ruled upon at the hearing prior to<br/>the receipt of evidence on the merits. If the Office of Education should choose to<br/>refuse top arbitrate a dispute, nothing in this section shall preclude the<br/>Association from seeking, through appropriate administrative or judicial<br/>proceedings, to compel the Office of Education to proceed to arbitration.</p>
<p>(9) The arbitrator shall have no power to render an award on a grievance claim<br/>rising out of an act or omission prior to the effective date of this Agreement or<br/>after the termination of this Agreement.</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an insufficient number of available qualified unit members for intersession<br/>assignments, applicants from outside the SDCOE may be recruited for assignments.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intersession assignments shall be made on a year-to-year basis. An intersession<br/>assignment automatically terminates at the end of the intersession worked.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intersession sites may be closed as determined by the Superintendent due to<br/>insufficient enrollment within ten (10 days) of the beginning of the intersession and the<br/>unit member shall be released from that intersession assignment. Unit members<br/>scheduled to teach specific classes that are subsequently closed due to low<br/>enrollments will be first given consideration for other vacancies that occur for which they<br/>are qualified based on the criteria above, except they may not displace unit members<br/>who have been notified of an Intersession placement.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assigned duty day for an intersession assignment shall be as defined in Section B<br/>of this Article.

<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator completes a an Observation Form for each formal observation. A<br/>copy of that Observation Form is provided to the unit member within two days of<br/>the formal observation.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Post-Observation Form may be completed by the unit member to enhance<br/>the discussion at the Post-Observation Conference.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Observation Conference will be scheduled within seven (7) workdays of<br/>the formal observation or as mutually agreed upon by unit member and<br/>evaluator.</p>
<p>D. Summary Evaluation Process</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator will complete the Summary Evaluation of Performance Form.</p>
<p>This form will summarize, in writing, observation visits and record summary<br/>evaluation remarks. Content of the following forms will be discussed at this<br/>conference: the Observation Form, the Post-Observation Form, and the<br/>Summary Evaluation of Performance Form.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be given an opportunity to thoroughly discuss the<br/>evaluation with the evaluator prior to placement of the Summary Evaluation of<br/>Performance Form in the Personnel File.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has the right to have a representative of the Association<br/>present at the Summary Evaluation Conference.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For permanent status unit members in classroom teaching assignments, an<br/>overall “unsatisfactory” summary evaluation rating will require a referral to PAR.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the Summary Evaluation conference, the unit member shall<br/>sign and date the Summary Evaluation of Performance form.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member disagrees with the final Summary Evaluation of Performance,<br/>he/she may write a response to be attached to the Evaluation form prior to<br/>placement in the unit member’s Personnel file.</p>
<p>(7) All forms pertaining to the unit member’s evaluation will be forwarded to the</p>

<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All conclusions and the overall summary from the second evaluation are final.<br/>There is no appeal.</p>
<p>3. Track II - Evaluation (available only for permanent status teachers and unit members in non¬<br/>classroom assignments)</p>
<p>A. The alternative evaluation process is designed to encourage creativity and innovation<br/>in support of instruction or counseling and professional growth. The process offers to<br/>unit members an alternative to the Track I evaluation process when they have<br/>demonstrated effective performance of the SDCOE Enhanced Standards of the<br/>Teaching Profession and the California Content Standards or the SDCOE Standards</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>for Professional School Counselor or when they are serving in non-classroom<br/>assignments. The process is flexible in order to encourage unit members to grow in<br/>areas of interest that promote and relate to student learning and instructional<br/>leadership through individual or group efforts. The goals, objectives, projects, and<br/>criteria established under Track II serve as the certificated performance evaluation in<br/>lieu of Track I, however, the Summary Evaluation of Performance form shall be<br/>completed at the conclusion of the evaluation process. The process is structured to<br/>strengthen cooperative collegial relationships.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent status unit members may elect, with mutual agreement of the evaluator, to<br/>participate in Track II if they meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received an overall evaluation rating of “meets standards” on the most recent<br/>evaluation, and</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participated in at least one cycle of Track I evaluation as a permanent status unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track II encourages the design of personalized systems of evaluation to promote<br/>professional growth, such as, but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-appraisal</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journal</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partner observations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peer appraisal</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parental and student commentaries</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;portfolio of accomplishments</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peer coaching</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a planning conference held in compliance with the timelines established in Section</p>
<p>1 (D), the unit member will collaborate with the evaluator on developing the preliminary<br/>evaluation plan, including constraints. Unit members and evaluators are encouraged<br/>to be creative and take risks when developing options, and to consider a focus on<br/>expansion and improvement of skills and/or the program. Within 7 working days</p>
<p>following the conference, the unit member will provide a final copy of the Annual<br/>Planning and Goals Form to the evaluator.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular informal classroom observations, or observation of other unit member-student<br/>interactions, are considered a normal function of general administrative supervision.<br/>Formal observations, as a part of the Track II evaluation process, are within the<br/>purview of the mutual agreement of the evaluator and unit member.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will provide a minimum of two (2) written updates to the evaluator<br/>between November 15 and April 1.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While participating in Track II, unit members continue to be responsible for<br/>performance of basic job description requirements, general unit member expectations,<br/>Education Code requirements, the California Standards for the Teaching Profession or<br/>the SDCOE Standards for the Professional Counselor as appropriate, and SDCOE<br/>goals and expectations.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the evaluation period, the unit member shall provide the evaluator<br/>with the appropriate documentation of satisfactory completion of the evaluation plan.<br/>The evaluator shall discuss the documentation with the unit member and complete a<br/>Summary Evaluation of Performance for inclusion in the unit member’s file.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summary Evaluation of Performance shall be completed and presented in<br/>accordance with the timeline of 12.1. B.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the development of the evaluation plan, the unit member may notify the<br/>evaluator of his/her desire to modify the evaluation plan. The changes must be made<br/>by mutual agreement. The unit member may, at his/her option, change to Track I prior<br/>to November 30. If the change is made to Track I, timelines will be mutually<br/>established in accordance with the appropriate sections of this Agreement.</p>
