<p>ARTICLE 12. SALARIES</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Schedule</p>
<p>Each unit member shall be paid in accordance with his/her placement on the salary<br/>schedule which is Appendix A.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service for One Full Semester</p>
<p>Contracted teachers who serve for one (1) full school semester shall receive no less<br/>than one-half (’A) the annual salary for their position.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy and Standards of Salary Schedule Administration</p>
<p>12.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancement on this schedule shall be based solely on professional<br/>preparation and experience.</p>
<p>12.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awarding of a contract for another year’s service will result in the<br/>advancement of a teacher on the salary schedule by one (1) step per year<br/>provided the unit member has rendered service on not less than seventy-five<br/>percent (75%) of the teaching days of the school year.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>12.3.2.1</p>
<p>An employee who renders service on at least fifty percent<br/>(50%) of the teaching days of the school year (but less than<br/>seventy-five percent [75%]) shall receive one-half credit for<br/>longevity advancement on the salary schedule (i.e., two [2]<br/>such years equals one [1] year).</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for Teaching Experience:</p>
<p>12.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for teaching experience will be granted on a year-to-year basis up to<br/>and including five (5) for experience outside the District.</p>
<p>12.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for teaching experience will be granted on a year-for-year basis for<br/>teaching within the District.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification</p>
<p>12.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training classifications are based on units of training of collegiate rank. All<br/>units shall be University of California semester units or the equivalent. A<br/>semester unit shall be eighteen (18) hours of lecture work or thirty-six (36)<br/>hours of laboratory work. A quarter hour is equal to 67/100 of a semester<br/>hour.</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For placement advancement on the salary schedule, the choices of courses<br/>of experience (travel) will be evaluated by the District Superintendent. The<br/>level of such courses should not be the sole basis for approval. Course<br/>content and its relationship to the teacher assignment should be of utmost<br/>importance.</p>
<p>12.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses taken for advancement shall receive prior written approval of the<br/>District Superintendent. Courses taken without prior written approval from<br/>the District Superintendent may not meet the requirements for advancement.</p>
<p>12.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper division units taken after the award of the requirement for a<br/>Bachelor’s Degree may be considered for advancement on the salary<br/>schedule. Since the requirements for the degree vary, the regulations of the<br/>degree-granting institution shall be the controlling factor.</p>
<p>12.5.4.1 Upon the award of a CLAD/B-CLAD, undergraduate units<br/>taken to satisfy the CLAD/B-CLAD requirements (after the<br/>award of a Bachelor’s Degree) shall be credited to salary<br/>schedule advancement. This provision shall only apply to a<br/>person employed by the District on January 1, 1997 in a<br/>probationary /permanent/temporary capacity.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Note: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher who has earned District Staff Development Credits as of</p>
<p>January 1, 2008, shall be &quot;grandfathered&quot; and shall continue to receive<br/>his/her annual stipend.</p>
<p>12.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final placement on the salary schedule will be made on the basis of units<br/>which have been verified by the granting institution and which are on file in<br/>the Superintendent’s office by September 30<sup>th</sup>. Proper verification of units,<br/>and their submission, are the sole responsibility of the teachers concerned.<br/>Proper verification may include a letter from the instructor, grade cards, or<br/>official transcripts of the granting institution.</p>
<p>12.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancement on the Salary Schedule</p>
<p>12.5.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To advance on the salary schedule, each unit member shall<br/>earn at least six (6) acceptable semester units every three (3)<br/>years after initial placement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>12.5.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a unit member not meet this requirement, he/she shall<br/>not advance further on the schedule because of years of service<br/>until the requirement is met.</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subsequently&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;met,</p>
<p>the unit member shall move to that step<br/>commensurate with his/her years of allowable<br/>experience (unless one or more additional<br/>intervening education requirements have also been<br/>missed - in which case the employee shall advance<br/>to the highest possible step that is consistent with<br/>the educational requirements that have been<br/>satisfied).</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column 3, step 3 in</p>
<p>1998/99. May not advance beyond step 5 unless six</p>
<p>(6) units were taken between the date of hire and the<br/>commencement of the 2001/02 school year. If the<br/>requirement is met in time for the 2004/05 school<br/>year, the unit member “jumps” from Column 3/Step<br/>5 to Column 3/Step 8. If the requirement is not met<br/>until the 2005/06 school year, however, the unit<br/>member will only “jump” from Column 3/Step 5 to<br/>Column 3/Step 8 because of the additional<br/>intervening education requirement that has also<br/>been missed.</p>
<p>12.5.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement is not applicable to the AB+75 column.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Board Certification</p>
<p>The District and the Association wish to recognize the effort and commitment of the<br/>bargaining unit members who achieve certification by the National Board for<br/>Professional Teaching Standards. As part of this recognition, the parties agree as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>12.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who attain certification from the National Board for<br/>Professional Teaching Standards are eligible to receive from the State<br/>Department of Education a one-time merit award of Ten Thousand Dollars<br/>($10,000). This payment is pursuant to Education Code Section 44395.</p>
<p>12.6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who receives national certification shall<br/>provide a copy of the certificate or other supporting documents<br/>to the District in order to receive this award.</p>
<p>12.6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall assist the unit member in expediting the<br/>paperwork to receive the Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000)<br/>award from the State Department of Education.</p>
<p>12.6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall pay this award within thirty (30) calendar<br/>days of receipt of the specified proof.</p>
<p>12.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist unit members in their quest for national certification, the District<br/>shall advance to the unit member a one-time salary award of One Thousand<br/>Dollars (SI,000) to defray costs. Should the unit member not receive the<br/>certification within twenty-four (24) months of payment, he/she shall repay<br/>these dollars to the District within thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>12.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awards for national certification are not subject to STRS contributions.</p>
<p>12.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section 12.6 shall be in full force and effect until one party&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives</p>
<p>written notice to the other of a desire to renegotiate the terms of this section</p>
<p>12.6.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>13.1 Definitions</p>
<p>13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance</p>
<p>An alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a specific<br/>provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>13.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gricvant</p>
<p>A unit member, or WESTA, who has been negatively affected by an alleged<br/>violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a specific provision of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>13.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day</p>
<p>Any day that the District Office is open for business unless “calendar day” is<br/>specified.</p>
<p>13.2 Purpose</p>
<p>13.2.1 The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may arise</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>affecting the welfare or working conditions of teachers. Both parties agree<br/>that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be<br/>appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>13.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible. As a<br/>result, the time limits specified at each level are jurisdictional and should be<br/>considered to be maximum and every effort should be made to expedite the<br/>process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>13.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>teacher having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any<br/>appropriate member of the administration, and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted without intervention by WEST A, provided that the adjustment shall<br/>be consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and WESTA has been given<br/>an opportunity to state its views.</p>
<p>13.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance is claimed by an individual, or WESTA, the following<br/>procedures will apply in this order:</p>
<p>13.2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Meeting</p>
<p>The grievant, either directly or through a member of the<br/>WESTA grievance committee, shall meet with the appropriate<br/>administrator to attempt resolution of the matter. This meeting<br/>shall occur within twenty (20) calendar days of the time the<br/>grievant knew, or should reasonably have known, of the facts<br/>giving rise to the alleged grievance.</p>
<p>13.2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.evel One</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the results of the informal<br/>meeting, a Level One grievance may be submitted to the<br/>Superintendent for resolution. This Level One grievance shall<br/>be submitted within twenty (20) days of the date of the<br/>informal meeting. The Superintendent shall respond within<br/>twenty (20) days of the Level One filing.</p>
<p>13.2.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two</p>
<p>13.2.4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the District’s<br/>Level One response, or if no written decision has<br/>been rendered within twenty (20) days, WESTA<br/>may submit the grievance to binding arbitration.</p>
<p>13.2.4.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any submission to binding arbitration shall be filed<br/>with the State Mediation and Conciliation Service</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>and the District within forty-five (45) days of the<br/>date the District’s Level One response was due.</p>
<p>13.2.4.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is necessary for the grievant, the designated<br/>WESTA grievance committee representative, or<br/>both, to attend a grievance investigation or hearing<br/>set during school hours, release time without loss of<br/>pay will be provided. Any teacher who is requested<br/>to appear in such investigations or hearings as a<br/>witness will be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>13.2.4.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of WESTA and the school district to<br/>keep any such grievance proceedings at an informal<br/>and confidential level. Consequently, any written<br/>information dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file<br/>and not in the personnel file of any participant.<br/>However, appropriate entries in the personnel file<br/>may be made regarding the subject of the grievance<br/>if it pertains to employee qualifications or fitness as<br/>determined by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>13.2.4.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, and a<br/>court reporter, will be borne equally by the Board<br/>and the Association. All other costs will be borne<br/>by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>13.2.4.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract<br/>from, or modify the terms of this Agreement or the<br/>written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures<br/>of the District, nor shall the arbitrator have the<br/>power to determine arbitrability of a grievance.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 14. DISCIPLINE LESS THAN DISMISSAL</p>
<p>14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee may initiate discipline against a bargaining unit<br/>member for cause. Discipline does not include counseling memos or letters of<br/>reprimand. Discipline may include, but is not limited to, suspension without pay.<br/>Suspension without pay pursuant to this Article shall be for not more than fifteen (15)<br/>work days. A copy of any notice of discipline shall be sent to the local office of the<br/>California Teachers Association.</p>
<p>14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to any such discipline being imposed, the Superintendent or his/her designee will<br/>discuss his/her proposed action and the reasons for the action with the employee, and<br/>take into account any response of the employee.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) days after notice of the proposed discipline has been mailed to the<br/>employee (certified mail, return-receipt requested), the employee may file a written<br/>appeal.</p>
<p>14.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an appeal is filed, it will be heard by the neutral, agreed-upon person whose decision<br/>will be binding. If the parties cannot agree upon a person, the State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Service will be notified and a list of arbitrators shall be obtained.<br/>Alternate check-off shall be used to select one from the list if the parties cannot agree<br/>upon one.</p>
<p>14.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All aspects of the appropriateness of the discipline imposed shall be within the<br/>exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitrator. The arbitrator may consider the following as<br/>guidelines in reaching a decision:</p>
<p>14.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Cause” includes two elements:</p>
<p>14.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the conduct in question constitutes sufficient reason<br/>(“cause”) for the employer’s action; and</p>
<p>14.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the penalty imposed is fair and reasonable under all<br/>the relevant circumstances of the individual case.</p>
<p>14.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether certain conduct is sufficient cause for disciplinary<br/>action, an arbitrator will look for several factors:</p>
<p>14.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would a reasonable person familiar with all the circumstances<br/>so conclude?</p>
<p>14.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the conduct in any way related to the work of the employee,<br/>and is it consistent with the employee’s obligation to the<br/>employer?</p>
<p>14.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether the penalty imposed was fair and reasonable, an<br/>arbitrator may review:</p>
<p>14.5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it excessive or reasonably related to the offense?</p>
<p>14.5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it consider the employee’s prior work record and the<br/>seriousness of the offense?</p>
<p>14.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disciplinary proceedings will be confidential.</p>
<p>14.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall pay the cost of the arbitrator.</p>
<p>33</p>

<p>APPENDIX C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEATLAND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>Shared Contract for Reduced Workload</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this program is to provide options for classroom teachers to reduce their<br/>workloads by sharing the responsibility for one (1) full-time position with another<br/>employee. Under this program, subject to District approval, certificated employees may<br/>share a position by working half-a-day, one (1) semester, or alternating quarters.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure:</p>
<p>Certificated employees, subject to District approval, may request to reduce their<br/>workload from full-time to half-time under the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee requests a reduction of the work year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee finds another certificated employee who also requests a reduction<br/>of the work year (a leave of absence) and who desires to work the remaining<br/>portion of the assignment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees requesting a reduction of the work year under the shared teaching<br/>policy must have permanent status with the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percentage employment under this program shall be on the terms mutually agreed<br/>to by the District and the employees.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated employees enrolled under this program must work the first three</p>
<p>(3) full days school is in session.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for shared teaching shall be made to the Principal prior to February 1<br/>of the school year preceding the school year for which the shared contract is<br/>requested. The Principal shall make a recommendation of approval, or<br/>disapproval, to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both members of a team are to assume full responsibility for the total classroom<br/>and instructional plan. Team members are required to jointly plan for both the<br/>school and their classroom on a regular basis.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both members of a team are required to take active part in District and school<br/>staff development, Back-to-School Night, Open House, and either Trimester Day<br/>Conferences or Trimester Evening Conferences. Advance notice shall be provided</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>for staff development days. Team members are required to comply with Article 3<br/>except that yard duty, and other duties within the on-campus duty day, shall be<br/>performed during the days that members are actually teaching. Members serving<br/>on a rotating basis (semester, quarter or partial week schedule such as 3/2) may be<br/>required to attend certain staff meetings at the discretion of the principal.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some flexibility may be allowed, scheduling is the responsibility of the<br/>principal.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shared contract teaching assignment shall be made with the approval of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>w;:vv,5. Assignments of shared contract employees shall be made in the best interests of<br/>the District as finally determined by the District, Assignments will be made for a<br/>period not to exceed one (1) school year.</p>
<p>6. If one (1) team member decides not to continue, or is unable to continue, their<br/>share of teaching responsibilities due to leave of absence, resignation, or<br/>termination, the District may assign the unfinished time of service to the other<br/>partner.</p>
<p>D. Salary and Benefits:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees, except for those employed the second semester, will receive pro¬<br/>rated salary which is to be paid on a monthly basis for twelve (12) months.<br/>Employees who are employed for the second Semester only may receive one-half<br/>(Vi) salary on a monthly basis for twelve (12) months if they post a bond<br/>guaranteeing service to the District or receive their salary on a monthly basis for<br/>the months commencing when they start teaching the second semester.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee may receive all fringe benefits granted to personnel in his/her<br/>classification on a pro-ration basis.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s and the District’s contribution to the retirement system will be<br/>based on actual salary paid. The employee will receive only the pro-rated service<br/>credit toward years of service as computed by the teacher's retirement system.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave benefits are accrued based on the pro-rated normal rate. Workers’<br/>Compensation insurance is based on the employee's actual salary.</p>
<p>E. Substitutes</p>
<p>1. When a teacher in the shared contract program uses a day of sick leave, the person<br/>sharing the contract with that individual shall, whenever possible, substitute for<br/>the partner. When this occurs, there will be no deduction of sick leave. However,<br/>there will be a pay-back day charged to that individual. Pay-back days are</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>defined as those days when the certificated partner substituted. If pay-back days<br/>do not equal out at the end of the year, sick days shall be deducted and the<br/>teaching partner paid for the extra days worked at the regular rate of pay.</p>
<p>2. When it is not possible for such sharing of substitute time, a regular substitute will<br/>be employed and a day of sick leave shall be charged to the person who is absent.</p>
