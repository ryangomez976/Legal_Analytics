<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to reasonable rules and regulations, the Association and its officers shall<br/>have the right to use school buildings and facilities for Association activities only outside<br/>established work hours except: (a) when an authorized Association representative secures<br/>advance permission from the Superintendent, or designee, for use of school facilities within<br/>established work hours, (b) when Association activities do not interfere with the school<br/>program or duties of bargaining unit members, and (c) when Association activities do not<br/>interfere with the rights of bargaining unit members to refrain from listening to or speaking<br/>with Association representatives.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designated representatives of the Association shall be allowed to visit schools to<br/>conduct Association business, provided upon arrival at any school, such representative shall<br/>make his/her presence known to the Principal, or designee. In no event shall such<br/>representative interfere with the instructional program of the school.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to pay a reasonable fee for any unusual wear or damage<br/>to District facilities caused by Association activities.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to post notices with an appropriate<br/>Association identification regarding activities and matters of Association concern on designated<br/>bulletin boards, at least one (1) of which shall be provided at each school site in areas<br/>frequented by bargaining unit members. The Association may use the District mail service and<br/>mailboxes for communications to bargaining unit members. Copies of all Association material<br/>posted or distributed for general Association information shall be mailed to the Superintendent,<br/>in a specially designated envelope indicating immediate delivery to the Superintendent, at the<br/>time the information is posted and/or distributed.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association will not post or distribute information which is knowingly false<br/>or defamatory. Such postings shall be subject to immediate removal by the District.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision will be made for Association announcements at the conclusion of each<br/>faculty meeting.</p>

<p>5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall be provided one (1) hour on the District orientation<br/>agenda to conduct an Association orientation meeting.</p>
<p>5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to eighty (80) days annually of Association<br/>leave for Association representation.

<p>5.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base salary for the Association President will be determined by the<br/>president's appropriate placement on the teacher's salary schedule for a work year equal to that<br/>contracted prior to his/her election as President. The Association will submit a written request<br/>annually identifying the amount of additional salary which the president should receive for<br/>additional work days/hours beyond the normal contract work year. The Association will<br/>reimburse the district on a quarterly basis all costs for salary, employer retirement contribution<br/>and statutorily retired contributions related to salary for the amount, which exceeds the base<br/>salary. The annual and monthly salary received by the Association President will be based on<br/>the combined total of the base salary and the additional duties salary as requested by the<br/>Association.</p>

<p>day from his/her duties in the district. The district shall pay the Vice President the base salary,</p>

<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOLUNTARY TRANSFERS</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria</p>
<p>8.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases of voluntary transfer, seniority shall be the controlling factor after<br/>the following criteria have been met:</p>

<p>8.3.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is in the best interest of students and learning, once the school year has<br/>begun, bargaining unit members may be required to delay an approved transfer until the end of<br/>the trimester/quarter or beginning of the next school year, whichever is first. In the event a<br/>transfer is to take place within four (4) weeks prior to state testing, the approved transfer may<br/>be delayed until immediately after the testing is completed.</p>
<p>8.3.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association will publish, at least annually, the processes<br/>and procedures for voluntary transfer. This publication shall include, when applicable, any<br/>unique “paper screening” rules other than those noted in Article 8.3.1.</p>

<p>8.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accommodate the opening or closing of schools.</p>
<p>Article 8<br/>Page 3 of 9</p>
<p>8.4.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet credential compliance.</p>

<p>Article 8<br/>Page 4 of 9</p>
<p>8.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for involuntary transfers involving Shared Contracts</p>
<p>A Shared Contract Team’s seniority will be based on the District seniority of the<br/>least senior partner. If it becomes necessary that the Team assignment would be the assignment<br/>involuntarily transferred, the Shared Contract Team will be transferred to another site or the<br/>Team will have the option of dissolving the shared contract and both returning to full-time<br/>employment. This will only be possible when there are two (2) positions available in the<br/>District and the staff having to be moved are qualified to teach in the positions available.</p>

<p>Article 9: EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic purpose of the evaluation process is to establish the premise of continuous<br/>improvement, to promote personal accountability, to encourage professional<br/>development, and to provide for due process. Within this context, evaluation is a<br/>cooperative and continuous process aimed at improving and maintaining quality<br/>educational programs, while serving as an essential component in the professional<br/>development of certificated personnel.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit shall not be required to evaluate other members of the<br/>bargaining unit.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No member of the unit shall be held accountable for any aspect of the educational<br/>program over which the bargaining unit member has no authority to correct deficiencies.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards and Key Elements</p>
<p>9.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members being evaluated are to be notified in writing within the<br/>first two weeks of their evaluation year. Notification may be given through either<br/>written memo or e-mail.</p>
<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each year in which the bargaining unit member is to be evaluated, and not<br/>later than the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> school week, each administrator will meet individually<br/>with the bargaining unit members being evaluated that year to choose standards<br/>and key elements for the bargaining unit member’s evaluation for the school year.</p>
<p>9.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator and bargaining unit member shall select three (3) standards<br/>upon which the evaluation will be based. The standards shall be selected as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>9.4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One standard selected by the bargaining unit member</p>
<p>9.4.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One standard selected by the evaluator</p>
<p>9.4.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One standard selected jointly by the bargaining unit member and the<br/>evaluator.</p>
<p>Article 9<br/>Page 1 of 9</p>
<p>9.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of three (3) key elements from each standard shall be the focus of the<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>9.4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) key elements from each standard shall be selected by the bargaining<br/>unit member being evaluated.</p>
<p>9.4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) key element from each standard shall be selected by the evaluator.</p>
<p>9.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Standards and Key Elements conference, the bargaining unit member<br/>being evaluated shall discuss with the administrator specific teaching strategies<br/>and evidence that will be used to measure success within the key elements<br/>selected.</p>
<p>9.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) working days following the Standards and Key Elements<br/>conference, the administrator shall provide a written summary of the conference to<br/>the bargaining unit member being evaluated for the bargaining unit member’s<br/>signature. The summary will consist of, but is not limited to the specific teaching<br/>strategies discussed and the evidence that will be used to measure success within<br/>the key elements.</p>
<p>9.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that either the bargaining unit member or the administrator determines<br/>that the chosen standards are inappropriate because of unforeseen circumstances,<br/>the administrator and the bargaining unit member will meet and review these<br/>standards and may alter these standards when it is felt that alterations are<br/>appropriate and in the best interest of a good educational program. The<br/>administrator shall provide notice of a change in standards and key elements to the<br/>bargaining unit member thirty (30) working days prior to completing formal<br/>observation on the modified areas.</p>
<p>9.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When agreement on standards cannot be attained, a third party shall be designated</p>
<p>to resolve the issue. The bargaining unit member shall select a District<br/>administrator to serve as the third party; said administrator shall not be related by<br/>blood or marriage to the bargaining unit member. The decision of the third party<br/>will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;final.</p>
<p>Article 9<br/>Page 2 of 9</p>
<p>9.4.9 No formal observation shall take place prior to the determination of the bargaining<br/>unit member’s standards or completion of the process identified in 9.4.3 above.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation And Evaluation</p>
<p>9.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic purpose of the evaluation document is to:</p>
<p>9.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify successful completion of chosen standards,</p>
<p>9.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide meaningful feedback to bargaining unit members so that standards<br/>evaluated as “needs improvement” or “unsatisfactory” can be remedied<br/>within a reasonable time frame,</p>
<p>9.5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide documentation of support for such remediation.</p>
<p>9.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observations shall last for not less than thirty (30) minutes and shall be<br/>followed by a conference in which the administrator and the bargaining unit<br/>member review the observation and what is to be incorporated into the written<br/>observation summary.</p>
<p>9.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such conference shall be held within ten (10) working days after the<br/>observation, and a printed summary shall be provided to the bargaining unit<br/>member within ten (10) working days of the observation conference.</p>
<p>9.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the first observation shall be announced.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary Bargaining Unit Members</p>

<p>12.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suffer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;injury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illness that is</p>
<p>expected to incapacitate the bargaining unit member for an extended period of time (in excess<br/>of ten (10) days) shall become eligible to use this catastrophic sick leave plan subject to the<br/>restrictions and conditions outlined below.</p>
<p>12.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member to receive donated sick leave must have exhausted<br/>all fully paid leave and be in a true catastrophic condition.</p>
<p>12.4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who has exhausted sick leave but still has differential<br/>leave available is eligible for withdrawal from the Bank. Use of the Bank is allowable only as</p>
<p>June 2006</p>
<p>Article 12<br/>Page 4 of 22</p>
<p>a supplemental to such differential leave. The District shall pay the bargaining unit member<br/>full pay and the Bank shall be charged one-half.</p>
<p>12.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member must be permanent, not probationary.</p>
<p>12.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of this Bank shall only be available to those eligible bargaining unit<br/>members who have made a donation of at least five (5) days to the Bank prior to their request,<br/>and have continued participation under Section 12.4.5.</p>
<p>12.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donation of sick leave by the bargaining unit member shall be irrevocable.</p>
<p>The bargaining unit member shall file a “Certificated Sick Leave Bank Deposit Form” with the<br/>payroll office. A donation to the Bank shall be a general donation from prior years’<br/>accumulations, and shall not be considered a donation to a specific bargaining unit member for</p>
<p>his/her exclusive use.</p>
<p>12.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no limit to the number of sick leave days a bargaining unit member may</p>
<p>donate to the Bank, so long as the minimum number of accumulated sick leave days available<br/>from the prior years’ accumulations in the bargaining unit member’s account does not fall<br/>below ten (10) days.</p>
<p>12.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional day of contribution will be required of all participants if the</p>
<p>number of days in the Bank falls below three hundred (300). Bargaining unit members who are<br/>currently drawing from the Bank at the time of the assessment need not contribute to remain<br/>eligible to draw from the Bank. If a participant has ten (10) or less days of remaining sick<br/>leave at the time of the assessment, they need not contribute the additional day to remain a<br/>participant in the Bank.</p>
<p>Article 12<br/>Page 5 of 22</p>
<p>12.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualifies the<br/>bargaining unit member for Workers’ Compensation benefits unless he/she has exhausted all<br/>Workers’ Compensation leave and his/her own paid leave.</p>
<p>12.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bargaining unit member may reasonably be presumed to be eligible<br/>for disability retirement under STRS or if applicable Social Security, he/she may be requested<br/>to apply for such retirement. Failure of the bargaining unit member to submit a complete<br/>application, including medical information provided by the applicants’ physician, within twenty<br/>(20) days will disqualify the bargaining unit member from further Bank payments.</p>
<p>12.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enrollment period will coincide with the mutually established open<br/>enrollment period for health and welfare benefits. Any change in current practices with regard<br/>to the scheduling of open enrollment will be discussed with the Fontana Teachers Association<br/>prior to implementation.</p>
<p>12.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;membership in the Bank occurs automatically whenever a</p>
<p>bargaining unit member fails to make his/her assessment contribution under section 12.4.5.<br/>The bargaining unit member shall not be eligible to draw from the Bank as of the effective date<br/>of cancellation. Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to the Bank shall not be<br/>returned if the bargaining unit member effects cancellation.</p>
<p>12.4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member wishing to use this Bank shall submit a “Certificated<br/>Sick Leave Bank Request for Withdrawal Form.” This form shall be submitted to the Human<br/>Resources Office. The request shall clearly state the details of the catastrophe and the amount<br/>of sick leave requested. Appropriate written verification of the catastrophic illness or injury<br/>must be included with the request. The bargaining unit member should be prepared to provide</p>
<p>June 2006</p>
<p>Article 12<br/>Page 6 of 22</p>
<p>additional documentation on the nature and severity of the illness or injury, if requested. A<br/>Sick Leave Bank Committee shall consider the request of the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>12.4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maximum number of duty days allowed to be utilized by one bargaining</p>
<p>unit member for a single catastrophic illness/injury shall not exceed forty (40) work days. A<br/>bargaining unit member may request a specific number of days on the form, available in the<br/>Personnel office, when the request is submitted. The bargaining unit member may request up<br/>to an additional forty (40) days should the condition continue by filing an additional request for<br/>consideration by the Committee.</p>
<p>12.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any days approved that are unused by the bargaining unit member shall be<br/>returned to the Bank.</p>
<p>12.4.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bargaining unit member uses a day from the Bank, pay for that day shall be</p>
<p>the same rate the bargaining unit member would have received had the bargaining unit member<br/>worked that day. No distinction shall be made as to the differing pay rates of the donors or<br/>recipients.</p>
<p>12.4.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During September of each year, the Payroll Office shall provide the Association<br/>a statement outlining the number of days available in the Bank as of September 1 of that year<br/>and the number of days used in the previous year.</p>
<p>12.4.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold Harmless</p>
<p>The Association agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf or on the behalf of any bargaining<br/>unit member, any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind related to any attempt by a bargaining<br/>unit member to retrieve donated sick leave used by another bargaining unit member pursuant to<br/>this provision. The Association also agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf, or on the</p>
<p>Article 12<br/>Page 7 of 22</p>
<p>behalf of any bargaining unit member, any grievance, claim, or lawsuit of any kind which<br/>attempts to challenge in any way the legality or enforcement of this provision.</p>
<p>12.4.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the Bank shall</p>
<p>be equitably distributed to the then current members of the Bank.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JURY DUTY</p>
<p>12.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall grant paid leaves for bargaining unit members called to serve<br/>on jury duty, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members shall file their court jury summons with their<br/>immediate supervisor at least three (3) working days prior to the date of their first scheduled<br/>appearance.</p>
<p>12.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members required to serve on jury duty must obtain written<br/>verification from the appropriate court indicating the date(s) that they actually appeared.</p>
<p>12.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members shall be paid the difference between their regular<br/>salary and the amount they receive in the form of jury duty pay, exclusive of mileage fees. The<br/>District shall pay the bargaining unit member’s regular salary, and the employee shall remit to<br/>the District the amount received as jury duty pay within ten (10) days of receiving such pay or<br/>prior to the close of the last payroll period of the year, whichever occurs earlier. In the event<br/>the bargaining unit member has failed to remit such fees, the District shall be entitled to<br/>withhold the appropriate amount from the bargaining unit member’s last salary check of the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>12.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a bargaining unit member called for jury duty is dismissed or<br/>excused by the assigned court prior to the end of his/her normal workday, the bargaining unit<br/>member need not report to work for the remaining portion of that day. In the event a</p>
<p>June 2006</p>
<p>Article 12<br/>Page 8 of 22</p>
<p>bargaining unit member’s jury duty is postponed prior to the end of the bargaining unit<br/>member’s workday, the bargaining unit member will subsequently contact his/her immediate<br/>supervisor to determine if it is necessary for the bargaining unit member to return to work for<br/>the remaining portion of that day. The travel distance between the bargaining unit member’s<br/>residence, assigned court, and worksite, as well as the time remaining in the bargaining unit<br/>member’s workday will be considered in making this determination.</p>
<p>12.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member shall be entitled to paid leave to appear in court as a<br/>witness when subpoenaed, other than as a litigant, or to respond to an official order from<br/>another governmental jurisdiction.</p>

A bargaining unit<br/>member may pay the other one-half (1/2) of his/her retirement contribution and receive full<br/>retirement credit.</p>
<p>12 .14 .15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate of Payment</p>
<p>A bargaining unit member on a sabbatical leave shall receive fifty (50) percent of his regular<br/>salary, computed on a monthly basis; provided, however, that the compensation for any<br/>employment accepted during such leave shall not exceed the difference between the regular<br/>salary the bargaining unit member would have received had he remained on regular duty and<br/>the salary for sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>12.14.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Payment</p>
<p>12.14.16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan A - Salary for such leave shall be paid in two (2) equal installments. The<br/>first shall be paid at the end of the bargaining unit member’s first year of work after returning<br/>from the leave. The second installment shall be paid at the end of the bargaining unit member’s<br/>second year of work following the leave.</p>
<p>12.14.16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan B - Salary shall be paid in the same manner as if the bargaining unit<br/>member were rendering normal service in the District. Such payment shall be conditional upon</p>
<p>June 2006</p>
<p>Article 12<br/>Page 19 of 22</p>
<p>the bargaining unit member furnishing a suitable bond indemnifying the Board of Education<br/>against loss in the event the bargaining unit member fails to meet the two (2) year teaching<br/>requirement because of death or physical or mental disability. The requirement for furnishing<br/>the bond may be waived by the Board of Education.</p>
<p>12.14.17 Method of payment, A or B, shall be left to the discretion of the bargaining unit<br/>member on sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>12.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTIVE MILITARY LEAVE</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members on military leave shall be entitled to rights as provided by State and<br/>Federal law.</p>
<p>12.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT OR ILLNESS LEAVE</p>
<p>12.16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable industrial accident leave shall be for not less than sixty (60) days<br/>during which the schools of the District are required to be in session or when the bargaining<br/>unit member would otherwise have been performing work for the District in any one (1) fiscal<br/>year for the same accident. Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.<br/>Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>12.16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member is absent from his/her duties due to an<br/>industrial accident or illness, he/she shall be paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any<br/>month in which the absence occurs as, when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity<br/>under Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a payment to him/her of not<br/>more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>12.16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase “full salary” as utilized in this action shall be computed so that it<br/>shall not be less than the bargaining unit member’s “average weekly earnings” as that phrase is<br/>utilized in Section 4453 of the Labor. For purposes of this Section, however, the maximum and</p>
<p>Article 12<br/>Page 20 of 22</p>
<p>minimum average weekly earnings set forth in Section 4453 of the Labor Code shall otherwise<br/>not be deemed applicable.</p>
<p>12.16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one (1) day for each day<br/>of authorized absence regardless of a temporarily disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>12.16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year,<br/>the bargaining unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due him/her</p>
<p>for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>12.16.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the bargaining unit<br/>member shall be entitled to other leave benefits as described herein. For the purposes of each<br/>of these sections, his/her absence shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of<br/>termination of the industrial accident or illness leave; provided that if the bargaining unit<br/>member continues to receive temporary disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much<br/>of his/her accumulated sick leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity,<br/>will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>12.16.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the bargaining unit member shall endorse to<br/>the District the temporary disability indemnity checks received due to his/her industrial<br/>accident or illness. The District, in turn, shall issue the bargaining unit member appropriate<br/>salary warrants for payment of the bargaining unit member salary and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement, other authorized contributions and the temporary disability indemnity, if any,<br/>actually paid to and retained by the bargaining unit member for periods covered by such salary<br/>warrants.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13<br/>RETIREMENT</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RETIREMENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROGRAM</p>
<p>13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1988&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereafter, bargaining unit members who retire</p>
<p>after no less than fifteen (15) total years of full-time paid service in the Fontana Unified School<br/>District and have achieved fifty (50) years of age, according to District records, shall be eligible<br/>to participate in the District-sponsored health and welfare benefits programs, provided that the<br/>bargaining unit member has been covered under a plan for the five (5) years immediately<br/>preceding retirement, as follows:</p>
<p>13.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option 1 - The District shall pay the premiums for medical insurance only at the<br/>same rate that is provided for current full-time employees for a period of eight (8) years after<br/>retirement.</p>
<p>13.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option 2 - The District shall pay the premiums for the total health and welfare<br/>package (inclusive of medical, dental, vision and life insurance) at the same rate that is<br/>provided for current full-time employees for six (6) years after retirement.</p>
<p>13.1.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option 3 - The District shall pay the premium for fourteen (14) years of Dental<br/>and Vision insurance at the same rate that is provided for current full-time employees.</p>
<p>13.1.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option 4 - Bargaining unit members serving the Fontana Unified School<br/>District with thirty-five (35) or more years of service will be granted lifetime medical benefits<br/>for the employee and spouse during the lifetime of the employee.</p>
<p>Full retirement benefits shall be granted to the surviving spouse of an employee<br/>who qualified for lifetime benefits under Article 13 until said surviving spouse remarries, or is<br/>eligible for Medicare benefits, but under no condition longer than eight (8) years.</p>
<p>Article 13<br/>Page 1 of 8</p>
<p>Under no circumstances shall the District’s maximum contribution for retired</p>
<p>employees exceed that contributed by the District for current full-time employees.</p>
<p>13.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purposes of the foregoing, completion of seventy-five percent (75%) of the</p>
<p>workdays within a school year shall constitute completion of a year of service. The Board may,<br/>at its sole discretion, modify retiree benefits stated herein when in its consideration the<br/>circumstances of an individual situation warrant such action.</p>
<p>13.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members who are working under less than a full-time contract<br/>shall be eligible for a pro-rata District contribution to the employee health and welfare benefits<br/>program in accordance with Article 25, Salaries and Fringe Benefits.</p>
<p>13.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members and retirees shall be responsible for payment, through<br/>payroll deduction or personal check (retirees), for health and welfare benefit selections, which<br/>exceed the benefits provided herein. Any retiree with retirement benefit entitlement pursuant to<br/>Article 13 (Retirement) who moves to an area not covered by the District’s medical, vision, or<br/>dental policy carrier(s) or for whom such carrier cannot provide convenient services may elect<br/>to find another coverage that meets their needs. Upon written request prior to May 31<sup>st</sup> of each<br/>fiscal year, the retired bargaining unit member shall be reimbursed in advance on a semi-annual<br/>basis for medical coverage so selected, provided that at no time shall the District be responsible<br/>to pay more than the dollar amount for which the retiree is eligible pursuant to Article 13. If<br/>the premium of the policy(s) selected exceeds the retired bargaining unit members’ maximum<br/>dollar eligible pursuant to Article 13, individually or in combination with any other policies<br/>provided to said bargaining unit member pursuant to Article 13, the retired bargaining unit<br/>member shall be responsible to pay the excess balance.</p>
<p>Article 13<br/>Page 2 of 8</p>
<p>13.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving spouse or other eligible dependents, if any, of a bargaining unit<br/>member who dies prior to expiration of his/her retirement health and welfare program (which<br/>may include medical, dental and vision protection) under this Article shall be entitled to<br/>continued benefits for the remainder of the original six (6) or eight (8) year program, whichever<br/>is applicable. For retirees who selected the full health and welfare benefits plan for six (6)<br/>years, the survivor benefits shall be limited to medical, dental and vision. For retirees who<br/>selected medical protection only for a period of eight (8) years, the survivor benefits shall be<br/>limited to medical only. In neither case shall the benefits include life insurance protection for<br/>the surviving spouse. This benefit of continued coverage for a surviving spouse and other<br/>eligible dependents, if any, shall only apply to bargaining unit members who retire and<br/>commence participation in the retirement health and welfare benefit program under this Article<br/>on or after October 1, 1985, and who die prior to termination of the program leaving a<br/>surviving spouse and other eligible dependents, if any.</p>
<p>13.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For married couples both of whom are employed by the District, arrangements<br/>may be made at the time of retirement for the health and welfare benefits to be utilized in a<br/>consecutive manner rather than concurrently. In this way, the protection to be enjoyed by<br/>married retirees may be expanded to a maximum of twelve (12) years or sixteen (16) years<br/>depending upon the retirement option selected. Under these circumstances wherein bargaining<br/>unit members would seek to defer the engagement of benefits for a period of time not to exceed<br/>six (6) or eight (8) years due to eligibility under these provisions due to marriage, the District’s<br/>responsibility to pay for health and welfare benefits shall remain at the same dollar amount in<br/>effect at the time of retirement. When benefits are subsequently engaged by the retired<br/>bargaining unit member, the retiree would be responsible for paying the difference in the rates</p>
<p>Article 13<br/>Page 3 of 8</p>
<p>from the date of retirement to the commencement of the benefits. Once the retiree’s</p>
<p>participation has commenced, the retiree’s contribution shall remain constant and any<br/>subsequent increases in the costs of the benefit programs would be borne by the District. It<br/>shall be expressly understood that life insurance protection under the district’s retirement plan<br/>shall not be included in this deferral program, and the life insurance coverage may exist during<br/>a concurrent period of time after the retirement of the married couple and under no<br/>circumstances shall this protection exceed the seventieth (70<sup>th</sup>) birthday of any participant.</p>
<p>13.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bargaining&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member who is not qualified under Article 13.1.7, who is</p>
<p>singularly employed by the District and who will be under continuous coverage through<br/>another health and welfare plan, may make arrangements at the time of retirement for the health<br/>and welfare benefits to be deferred to a future date. This date cannot extend beyond ten (10)<br/>years after retirement. Once the date for beginning health and welfare coverage is made, it<br/>shall be used in a consecutive manner. The retiree would be responsible for paying the<br/>difference in the rates from the date of retirement to the commencement of the benefits. When<br/>benefits are subsequently engaged by the retired bargaining unit member, the District shall pay<br/>only the total dollar amount that the District would have been responsible for if the bargaining<br/>unit member had entered into the program at the time of retirement. It shall be expressly<br/>understood that life insurance protection under the District’s retirement plan shall not be<br/>included in this deferral program. The District shall maintain a list of deferred retirees. Thus<br/>accurate information will be readily available and can be given to each retiree who chooses to<br/>defer said benefits. Said list will be conveyed to the Association at biannual intervals.</p>

<p>(D) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itinerant teachers shall offer the enrichment instruction in physical<br/>education, music and science.</p>
<p>(1) Itinerant teachers providing instruction in this program will have the<br/>same number and length of preparation periods as bargaining unit<br/>member teaching fourth (4<sup>th</sup>) or fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) grade students.</p>
<p>Article 14<br/>Page 17 of 41</p>
<p>(2) If the itinerant teacher is unavailable and if there is no substitute<br/>teacher available to teach the enrichment period, the bargaining unit<br/>member who is the teacher of record for the class shall provide the<br/>instruction during the enrichment period.</p>
<p>i The bargaining unit member who is the teacher of record<br/>for the class shall be compensated at the bargaining unit<br/>member’s Appendix C contract hourly rate of pay<sup>6</sup> for<br/>providing the instruction during the enrichment period.</p>

<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When bargaining unit members at an elementary school are needed to<br/>substitute for other bargaining unit members at that site, substitutes shall<br/>be drawn from a pool of volunteers.</p>
<p>(1) Each trimester, the names of the bargaining unit members<br/>volunteering to substitute shall be listed and posted at each site.

<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial compensation</p>
<p>i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-day substitution is defined as six (6) hours per day.</p>
<p>ii &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation will be based on the following formula:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of hours, to nearest half hour, during which<br/>the bargaining unit member substituted multiplied by<br/>Appendix C contract hourly rate divided by the number<br/>of bargaining unit members who substituted for the<br/>absent bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formula can be expressed as:</p>
<p>(Number of hours substituted * Appendix C contract hourly rate)</p>
<p>Number of bargaining unit members who substituted</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accrued leave based on the number of students above the Target<br/>Ratio set forth in Article 15 and the total time of substitution.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>i By way of example, in first (1<sup>st</sup>) through third (3<sup>rd</sup>) grades<br/>where the Target Ratio is 20 students, providing substitute<br/>coverage for 20 students would result in one (1) full day or<br/>six (6) hours of accrued leave.</p>
<p>Accrued leave cannot exceed amount of leave the bargaining unit member would have accrued if the bargaining<br/>unit member had not taken any leave during the bargaining unit member’s employment with the Fontana Unified<br/>School District.</p>

<p>(C) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For CSP schools on a one hundred seventy-five (175) day student<br/>calendar, the student contact times set forth in Section 14.14.1.2 above</p>
<p>Article 14<br/>Page 32 of 41</p>
<p>shall be adjusted proportionately in accordance with the State waiver<br/>agreement which authorizes the one hundred seventy-five (175) day<br/>school year for CSP multi-track schools.</p>
<p>14.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school site shall develop a plan to provide for two (2) daily &quot;health and<br/>welfare&quot; breaks from student contact duties for each bargaining unit members<br/>teaching kindergarten.</p>
<p>14.14.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will ensure, to the extent possible, that all bargaining unit<br/>members teaching kindergarten are provided traditional kindergarten teaching<br/>facilities or that their classrooms are as close to restroom facilities and<br/>drinking fountains as feasible.</p>
<p>14.14.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of strategies may be used to implement health and welfare breaks<br/>within the instruction day provided as follows:</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific plan used by each school shall be agreed upon by the<br/>bargaining unit members teaching kindergarten at the site and the site<br/>administrator,</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan does not involve a loss of the bargaining unit member’s class’<br/>instructional minutes more than necessary for the bargaining unit<br/>member to utilize bathroom facilities and return to class,</p>
<p>(C) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is approved by the district, and</p>
<p>(D) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is consistent with applicable law and the policies of the District<br/>Board of Education, including those governing kindergarten instructional<br/>minutes.</p>
<p>14.14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inasmuch as bargaining unit members who teach kindergarten do not participate in<br/>minimum days under Section 14.7.2 they shall not be required to attend faculty<br/>meetings. The site administrator shall establish other means, consistent with the<br/>provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, for communicating essential<br/>information that was part of site faculty meetings to bargaining unit members<br/>teaching kindergarten.</p>
<p>Article 14<br/>Page 33 of 41</p>
<p>14.14.4 Option One Provisions</p>
<p>14.14.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Option One” provides for kindergarten classes with a teacher to student ratio<br/>of no more than twenty-to-one (20:1).</p>
<p>14.14.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option One is presently held in abeyance in the district pending the acquisition<br/>of funds sufficient to provide it to the district’s kindergarten students.</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree that the implementation of Class<br/>Size Reduction (CSR) strategies is a priority for the district educational<br/>program. When adequate funding is available, the District will<br/>implement Option One in kindergarten classes.</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to make a good faith effort to find the resources<br/>necessary to implement Option One.</p>
<p>14.14.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Option One is again implemented in the district, the District and the<br/>Association agree to meet, negotiate and enter into a written agreement<br/>governing the implementation of Option One.</p>
<p>14.14.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Day Compensation</p>
<p>14.14.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members teaching in a “PM” kindergarten under an AM-PM<br/>kindergarten arrangement under Section 14.14.9.3 and bargaining unit<br/>members who teach in a staggered day kindergarten under Section 14.14.9.4<br/>will be compensated annually for two minimum days at their per diem rate of<br/>pay for the end-of-trimester minimum days.</p>
<p>14.14.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those kindergarten teachers who can be released from the daily 100 minutes<br/>without violating the CSR requirements will be released from 100-minute<br/>instructional responsibilities in order to participate in the end-of-trimester<br/>minimum days.</p>
<p>14.14.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten Parent Conference Procedures</p>
<p>14.14.6.1 Kindergarten Teachers of Record who have more than twenty (20) students<br/>shall receive additional compensation for ten (10) hours at their per diem rate<br/>of pay for parent conferences duties.</p>
<p>(A) Kindergarten Teachers of Record who have 20 or fewer students will be<br/>ineligible for additional compensation for parent conferences but they<br/>will be released from CSR or other additional instructional<br/>responsibilities during the scheduled parent conference week.</p>
<p>14.14.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kindergarten Teacher of Record may schedule parent conferences during<br/>any portion of their normal workday, except times in which they have duties<br/>involving student contact.</p>
<p>14.14.6.3 Regardless of when parent conferences are held by the bargaining unit<br/>member, each Kindergarten Teacher of Record will be paid for parent<br/>conferences as provided in Subsection 14.14.6 above.</p>
<p>14.14.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten planning is expected to be a collaborative, participatory process<br/>involving the site administrator and bargaining unit members teaching<br/>kindergarten.</p>
<p>14.14.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of kindergarten class models</p>
<p>14.14.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After consultation and discussions with bargaining unit members teaching<br/>kindergarten and after considering possible solutions and proposals presented<br/>by bargaining unit members teaching kindergarten, the school administration<br/>will have the final authority with regard to the models to be used at each<br/>individual school site for the implementation of kindergarten class size<br/>reduction, provided the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model or models must be feasible under the school site’s program<br/>facilities, scheduling, staffing, program elements, and other constraints.</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A model will not be considered feasible if the use of that model under<br/>provisions of this agreement requires that one currently-assigned<br/>bargaining unit member displace another currently-assigned bargaining<br/>unit members from that bargaining unit member’s grade or track<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>14.14.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a conflict regarding the selection of kindergarten class models at a site is not<br/>resolved at the school site, the Association President (or the President’s</p>
<p>designee) and the District’s Assistant Superintendent for Personnel Services<br/>(or Assistant Superintendent’s designee) will meet with the school<br/>administration and the planning committee of the school to discuss and<br/>consider the conflict.</p>
<p>14.14.8.3 After each school has identified the model or models which will be used to<br/>implement class size reduction at that individual school site, decisions with<br/>regard to the assignment of individual bargaining unit members to a CSR<br/>model and classroom will be governed by the following:</p>
<p>(A) After feasibility issues in Section 14.14.8.1 have been resolved,<br/>assignment to kindergarten classes will be based on bargaining unit<br/>member preferences as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member with the most grade level seniority shall<br/>be offered the assignment of her or his choice.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two or more bargaining unit members have the same grade level<br/>seniority, the assignment shall be offered to the bargaining unit<br/>member with the most school site seniority.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two or more bargaining unit members have the same grade level<br/>seniority and the same school site seniority, the assignment shall be<br/>offered to the bargaining unit member with the most district seniority.</p>
<p>14.14.9 Except where there is an agreement under Section 14.14.9.5, the kindergarten<br/>models set out in Sections 14.14.9.3 and 14.14.9.4 below will be used to<br/>accomplish kindergarten CSR.</p>
<p>14.14.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all models, CSR time in which kindergarten classes are at or below the<br/>twenty-to-one (20:1) student/teacher ratio or less must be used for instruction<br/>in language arts and mathematics.</p>
<p>14.14.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of the appropriate models for kindergarten at each individual site<br/>will be made annually.</p>
<p>14.14.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AM-PM (Shared Teaching) Ki ndergarten Model</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In schools using this model, the Kindergarten Teacher of Record teaches<br/>a class of up to the size specified in Article 15 of this Agreement while a<br/>CSR kindergarten teacher teaches language arts and math to a subgroup<br/>of twenty (20) students or less for one hundred (100) minutes. The<br/>Kindergarten Teacher of Record and a CSR kindergarten teacher then<br/>reverse their respective roles with the previous Kindergarten Teacher of<br/>Record becoming the CSR kindergarten teacher and the previous CSR<br/>kindergarten teacher becoming the Kindergarten Teacher of Record for a<br/>second class up to the limits specified in Article 15 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within constraints imposed by student transportation needs, students<br/>shall be assigned to the AM-PM kindergarten classes in a way that<br/>ensures that all kindergarten classes at that the school, if a single track<br/>school, or on a track, if a multi-track school, are of reasonably equivalent<br/>size.</p>
<p>(C) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team Planning under the AM-PM Kindergarten Model.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kindergarten Teacher of Record and kindergarten CSR teacher<br/>shall mutually develop a responsibility plan for implementing the<br/>language arts and mathematics portions of the kindergarten program.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Kindergarten Teacher of Record and the CSR teacher are<br/>unable to come to a consensus on any significant matter, they shall<br/>meet with the school administrator who will assist them in<br/>developing an acceptable plan.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school administrator shall give primary consideration to the<br/>continuity of the Kindergarten Teacher of Record's program and<br/>classroom plan.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a mutual agreement, acceptable to the site administrators, cannot be<br/>reached, the site administrator will have the final authority to resolve<br/>the dispute.</p>
<p>Article 14<br/>Page 37 of 41</p>
<p>14.14.9.4</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a problem arises once the plan has been implemented, all<br/>parties will meet to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolutions of any disputes shall be reduced to writing.</p>
<p>(D) The kindergarten Teacher of Record and CSR kindergarten teacher<br/>working will both be paid for up to an additional one (1) hour per week<br/>at their per diem rate for time actually spent in joint planning for<br/>teaching their respective classes.</p>
<p>Staggered Day Kindergarten Model</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in Section 14.14.9.4(B) below, the staggered day<br/>kindergarten model involves only one bargaining unit member as the<br/>teacher of record without the support of another bargaining unit member.<br/>The staggered day kindergarten provides for a twenty-to-one (20:1) ratio<br/>for one hundred (100) minutes for each of two groups of students that<br/>together constitute one class of a size that does not exceed the limits set<br/>forth in Article 15 of the Agreement.</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staggered day kindergarten day has three segments:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kindergarten Teacher of Record teaches an initial student group<br/>(the “early group”) of no more than twenty (20) students for one<br/>hundred (100) minutes of CSR time. This period of time must be<br/>devoted exclusively to instruction in language arts and mathematics.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second student group (the “late group”) of no more than 20<br/>students joins the initial student group. The Kindergarten Teacher of<br/>Record teaches both groups together for one hundred (100) minutes.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early group is then dismissed, and the Kindergarten Teacher of<br/>Record teaches the late group for one hundred (100) minutes of CSR<br/>time. This period of time must be devoted exclusively to instruction<br/>in language arts and mathematics.</p>
<p>(C) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within constraints imposed by student transportation needs, students<br/>shall be assigned to staggered day kindergarten classes at the school, if a</p>
<p>Article 14<br/>Page 38 of 41</p>
<p>single track school, or on a track, if a multi-track school, in a manner that<br/>ensures that all kindergarten classes and the early and late groups within<br/>the staggered day kindergarten classes are of reasonably equivalent size.</p>
<p>14.14.9.5 If an individual school site develops a viable kindergarten model that is not<br/>contained in this agreement, the school will be given the opportunity to jointly<br/>consult with the Association President and Assistant Superintendent, Human<br/>Resources.</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a model receives district approval, compensation of bargaining unit<br/>members under that model will be proportionate based on the model<br/>contained in this agreement (using any average increase in required<br/>student contact minutes as the basis for increased compensation), and</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association President will have the power to agree to a<br/>compensation plan on behalf of the Association.</p>
<p>14.15 Workdays of bargaining unit members not specifically addressed in the foregoing<br/>Agreement provisions.</p>
<p>14.15.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and District acknowledge that the work year and workday<br/>provisions of Article 14 above do not specifically or adequately address the needs<br/>and requirements of certain groups of bargaining unit members.

<p>19.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All such written notices and reprimands shall be based on substantiated<br/>evidence.</p>
<p>19.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases where a bargaining unit member’s job performance is at issue, the<br/>District shall provide a real and continuing program of positive assistance to the<br/>bargaining unit member to overcome the alleged deficiencies. Such positive</p>

<p>19.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit or in any way impair the rights of a<br/>bargaining unit member or the District under the Education Code including Section<br/>44944 governing suspension and dismissals. No bargaining unit member shall be<br/>suspended more than five (5) working days during a single school year. No<br/>suspension shall occur prior to application of the progressive discipline and correction<br/>procedure set forth in paragraph 19.3 above, except as provided in paragraph 19.6<br/>herein.

<p>other significant employment standards. The parties to this Agreement recognize that</p>
<p>emergency situations can occur involving a clear, present and serious danger to the</p>
<p>health and welfare of students and employees under which the Education Code</p>
<p>authorizes the use of emergency suspension. An emergency suspension or letter of<br/>reprimand shall be handled by the District as a priority item. In cases of emergency<br/>suspension, the District shall serve notice and statement of charges upon the<br/>employee, who shall be entitled to respond to the charges supporting the emergency<br/>suspension.</p>
<p>19.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disciplinary action may be settled at any time following the service of notice of<br/>discipline. The terms of the settle shall be reduced to writing.

<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District are continuously striving to provide the highest possible<br/>quality of education. In order for students to succeed in learning, teachers must succeed<br/>in teaching. Therefore, the parties agree to cooperate in the design and implementation<br/>of programs to improve the quality of instruction through expanded and improved<br/>professional development and peer assistance. Teachers referred to or who volunteer for<br/>the program are viewed as valuable professionals who deserve to have the best resources<br/>available provided to them in the interest of improving performance to a successful<br/>standard.</p>

<p>Article 20<br/>Page 5 of 12</p>

A copy of the Consulting Teacher’s report shall be<br/>submitted to and be discussed with the Referred Participating Teacher to receive<br/>his or her input before it is submitted to the Joint Committee. The Participating<br/>Teacher’s signing of the report does not necessarily mean agreement, but rather<br/>that he or she has received a copy of the report. The Consulting Teacher shall<br/>submit a final report to the Joint Committee. The Referred Participating Teacher<br/>shall have the right to submit a written response, within twenty (20) days, and<br/>have it attached to all copies of the final report.

<p>Article 20<br/>Page 7 of 12</p>
<p>20.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of referred Peer Assistance and Review, evaluations shall be the<br/>responsibility of the Joint Committee. The results of the Referred Participating<br/>Teacher’s participation in the PAR Program shall be made available for placement in his<br/>or her personnel file. Per MOU dated August 8, 2001, this clause shall be held in<br/>abeyance pending a positive recommendation by the Joint Committee to commence<br/>implementation.</p>
<p>20.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to indemnify and provide a defense for the Consulting Teacher<br/>against any claims, causes of action, damages, grievances, administrative proceedings or<br/>any other litigation arising from the Consulting Teacher’s participation in Peer<br/>Assistance and Peer Review.</p>
<p>20.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers shall assist Participating Teachers by demonstrating, observing,<br/>coaching, conferencing, referring and/or by other activities, which, in their professional<br/>judgment, will assist the Participating Teacher. When necessary to obtain specialized<br/>subject matter or instructional competency, the Consulting Teacher shall be authorized to<br/>obtain additional assistance to fully address identified areas of deficient performance.<br/>This assistance shall be obtained with the approval of the Joint Committee and pursuant<br/>to procedures established by the District Coordinator. In such cases, the Consulting<br/>Teacher shall retain primary responsibility for the assistance and support program.</p>
<p>20.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROGRAM CONFIGURATION MODELS FOR CONSULTING TEACHERS</p>
<p>20.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preferred model for service by Consulting Teachers in the Peer Assistance<br/>and Review Program shall be a Full-time Release Model. When the Joint<br/>Committee deems it necessary or appropriate, other models as indicated below<br/>may be used. In calculating all ratios indicated below, a Referred Participating<br/>Teacher shall be deemed to have a weight of 2.</p>
<p>20.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-Release Model</p>
<p>20.13.2.1 Each Full Release Consulting Teacher model shall serve a 192, “flexible”<br/>calendar while in the position of Consulting Teacher. Days of work shall<br/>be defined as an 8-hour. Compensation for this expanded work year will</p>
<p>Article 20<br/>Page 8 of 12</p>
<p>be a .13 factor based on the individual bargaining unit member’s<br/>placement on the certificated salary schedule. Hours in excess of 8-hours<br/>per day shall be approved by the Joint Committee and compensated at<br/>certificated hourly rate.</p>
<p>20.13.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Full Release Consulting Teacher shall be assigned no more than the<br/>equivalent of 15 Participating Teachers. No Full-Release Consulting<br/>Teacher shall be assigned more than five (5) Referred Participating<br/>Teachers.</p>
<p>20.13.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of his/her service as a Full-time Release Consulting<br/>Teacher, the teacher shall have the right to return to the school and track<br/>of his/her prior assignment unless such assignment no longer exists, in<br/>which case. Voluntary Transfer Article 8.7-8.8 will be utilized.</p>
<p>20.13 .2.4 If, given fiscal constraints, the district finds it necessary to implement the<br/>full-release model with 182 day work year and a &quot;6-hour&quot; workday, the<br/>Joint Committee will establish and monitor adjustments in the caseload<br/>(number of teachers served) and the expected number of direct hours of<br/>service per participant. This full-release configuration will provide the<br/>Consulting Teacher the ability to schedule observations and meetings for<br/>teachers served within the parameters of the normal school day, subject<br/>to approval of the Consulting Teacher supervisor. In addition, the<br/>Consulting Teacher will be allowed to schedule the 182 day work year,<br/>with approval of the Consulting Teacher supervisor, to meet the needs of<br/>both the teachers served and the Consulting Teacher.</p>
<p>20.13.3 Half-Release Model</p>
<p>20.13.3.1 This model will normally involve a partial Consulting Teacher<br/>assignment combined with a partial teaching assignment or a shared<br/>assignment between two (2) half-time Consulting Teachers. The work<br/>year shall be established at 192, (8-hour) days with a .13 factor.</p>
<p>Article 20<br/>Page 9 of 12</p>
<p>Additional hours, approved in advance by the Joint Committee, shall be<br/>compensated at the certificated hourly rate.</p>
<p>20.13.1.2 Each Half-Release Consulting Teacher will be assigned no more than the<br/>equivalent of seven (7) Participating Teachers. No half-release Consulting<br/>Teacher shall be assigned more than two (2) Referred Participating<br/>Teachers.</p>
<p>20.13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-Contract Model</p>
<p>20.13.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This model may be approved for an individual whose only assignment is<br/>as a Consulting Teacher working on a half-time basis. This model will<br/>involve a 182-day flexible calendar. Each work day shall be 4 hours with<br/>compensation at .13% factor above the individual bargaining unit<br/>member’s placement on the certificated salary schedule adjusted for half¬<br/>time service. In addition, each Half Contract Teacher will serve ten (10)<br/>full days for training and other related purposes with compensation at a<br/>.13% factor above the individual per diem rate of pay based on the<br/>certificated salary schedule.</p>
<p>20.13.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Half-Contract Consulting Teacher will be assigned no more than the<br/>equivalent of seven (7) Participating Teachers. No Half-Contract<br/>Consulting Teacher shall be assigned more than two (2) Referred<br/>Participating Teachers.</p>
<p>20.13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stipend Model</p>
<p>20.13.5.1 When necessary the Joint Committee may use an extra-duty assignment<br/>“Stipend Model” to meet unusual or especially challenging needs. When<br/>an individual teacher serves as a Consulting Teacher in this model,<br/>compensation shall be $5,000.00 for 125 hours of direct services. Each<br/>Stipend Model Consulting Teacher will be assigned to no more than two</p>
<p>(2) Participating Teachers. Additional hours of service, approved in<br/>advance by the Joint Committee, shall be compensated at certificated<br/>hourly rate.</p>
<p>Article 20<br/>Page 10 of 12</p>
<p>20.13.6 Retired Teacher Model</p>
<p>20.13.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This model may be used to employ retired teachers to serve as<br/>Consulting Teachers for Non-Referred Participants. Compensation may<br/>be based on the stipend model above for no more than two (2)<br/>Participating Teachers or the pro-rated hours of service based on the<br/>stipend model if the retired teacher is authorized to serve under Section</p>
<p>13.4 (Ancillary Services Contract) with compensation as specified in<br/>Article 13 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>20.13.7 Consulting Teachers Model</p>
<p>20.13.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers will not be required to provide workshops, training,<br/>participate in committees or perform other additional duty assignments,<br/>except as specifically related to the functions and activities of the Peer<br/>Assistance and Review Program.</p>
<p>20.14 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</p>
<p>20.14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article does not expand nor diminish bargaining unit member’s ability to<br/>grieve an evaluation pursuant to the negotiated agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>20.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members serving on the Joint Committee shall receive a stipend<br/>of four thousand three hundred dollars ($4,300) for such service.

In the event that an alternate is requested to serve, the alternate shall<br/>receive a stipend equal to the pro-rated value of the meetings attended, as<br/>indicated above.</p>
<p>20.14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities, duties and responsibilities of Consulting Teachers or Association<br/>representatives and alternate representatives to the Joint Committee shall be<br/>deemed a specific exception to Article 9, Clause 9.12.1 of the Collective<br/>Bargaining Agreement.</p>

<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events related to the teacher’s fulfillment of his/her professional obligations.</p>

<p>hired in the District who served on shared contracts in other districts will be given credit for</p>
<p>one (1) year of service for every two (2) years of shared contract experience. Substitute</p>
<p>teaching experience in districts other than Fontana Unified School District shall not be</p>
<p>qualifying toward advanced salary placement. Day-to-day substitute experience in the Fontana</p>
<p>Unified School District shall not be qualifying toward advanced salary placement. A substitute</p>

<p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are qualified, for each year, as the Professional Growth Column is phased in. In addition.</p>
<p>Appendix B-l<br/>Page 1 of 3</p>
<p>the Professional Growth increment will be paid to eligible bargaining unit employees pursuant<br/>to Appendix B-3.</p>
<p>For example, an employee with 26 years FUSD experience, who was eligible for Class<br/>IV, prior to this agreement, will receive three (3) longevity increments (3 x $639.00) plus<br/>$1,300 (pro-rated) for Step 18 on Class V, effective the first day of the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester for the<br/>1999/2000 school year. This pattern will continue to be followed as the Professional Growth<br/>Class V is phased in. This pattern will also be followed for employees with 30, 34, or more<br/>years of FUSD experience.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Additional longevity increments for every four (4) years of FUSD service above<br/>twenty-six (26) years shall be based on longevity increments per Class 1 above. Placement of<br/>these steps on the salary schedule specifically supersedes and eliminates any previous practice<br/>regarding anniversary or longevity increments. Eligibility for these steps is based on years of<br/>service in the Fontana Unified School District Certificated Bargaining Unit.</p>
<p>Fully credentialed teachers only. Interns and Emergency credentials (or the<br/>equivalent), annual salary $42,851. The intent of this proposal is that all bargaining unit<br/>members will receive at least current salary plus 3% COLA except when certificated salary<br/>placement was in error.</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members verifying eligibility for advancement by May 1, 2000, based<br/>on unit credits as noted above pursuant to deadlines for completion of coursework established<br/>in MOU dated 2/10/99 and Appendix A of the Master Contract, shall receive retroactive<br/>compensation on August 1, 2000. Bargaining Unit Members verifying eligibility after May 1,<br/>2000, shall receive retroactive compensation within the time frame established by law.</p>
<p>Appendix B-l<br/>Page 2 of 3</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Class V implementation effective date shall be the first (1<sup>st</sup>) day of the second (2<sup>nd</sup>)<br/>semester of 1999-2000, subject to the terms and conditions identified in Appendix B-2 of this</p>

<p>Previous Teaching Experience and Military Service Credit</p>
<p>Credit is allowed on the salary schedule for previous teaching experience and military service<br/>on the following basis:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching experience at one step for each year, not to exceed nine steps.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military service at one step for each twenty (20) months of active duty, not to<br/>exceed three (3) steps.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A combination of teaching experience and military service shall not exceed nine<br/>(9) steps.</p>

<p>APPENDIX B-2<br/>DEVELOPMENT CENTER SALARY SCHEDULE<br/>(Permit Teachers)</p>
<p>The workday for Permit Teachers shall be the same as the workday for any other<br/>bargaining unit member as per Article 14, Workday, of the Master Contract between the Board<br/>of Education and the Fontana Teachers Association.</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall receive one (1) year equivalent service credit for each<br/>year of experience as a Child Development Teacher (Permit Teacher) in the Fontana Unified<br/>School District, up to a maximum of nine (9) years. This service credit will be granted for all<br/>service rather than only Post-B.A. service.</p>
<p>When there is a 35% attrition of the workforce hired prior to this agreement. Step 6 &amp; 7<br/>will be added to the final column.</p>
<p>Current salary schedules for employees hired prior to May 17, 2000 are found in<br/>Appendix B-3.</p>
<p>Current salary schedules for employees hired after May 17, 2000 are found in<br/>Appendix B-3.</p>
<p>The salary schedule is based on a work year of one hundred eighty-two (182) days with<br/>one hundred eighty (180) days of pupil instruction. Each salary schedule derived on this<br/>agreement shall identify a specific number of workdays and shall provide two (2) days annually<br/>of fully paid teacher preparation or staff development time. Any additional work calendars for<br/>longer/shorter work year and/or longer/shorter work day will be pro-rated using salary<br/>schedules in Appendix B-3.</p>
<p>Summer school employment shall be voluntary and shall be compensated at the<br/>certificated hourly rate.</p>
<p>Class and Step Placement on Teachers Salary Schedule for Child Development Bargaining Unit<br/>Members Selected to Become Certificated Teachers</p>
<p>FUSD Child Development, Pre-school and Day Care teachers selected for<br/>employment as a K-12 teacher will have the opportunity to move into K-12 vacancies.<br/>Bargaining unit members selected for employment under this provision must meet minimum<br/>qualifications to be fully credentialed. When there is a planned reduction in force in the Child<br/>Development Department, bargaining unit members will need to meet only the minimum<br/>requirements of an emergency credential to be eligible for consideration.</p>
<p>Placement on the salary schedule will not result in a cut in pay. Salary Placement<br/>will ensure that annual compensation will not be less than the amount bargaining unit members<br/>would have earned had they remained in their current positions within the Child Development<br/>Department. When initial placement results in a bargaining unit member being placed at a rate<br/>of pay higher than what he/she would have earned in their current position, movement will not<br/>be allowed to a higher class until units have been earned consistent with placement on the<br/>salary schedule as a fully credentialed teacher. However, step movement will be allowed<br/>consistent with the current salary schedule.</p>

<p>ROTC STAFF “STIPEND ADJUSTMENTS”</p>
<p>Whereas, members of the ROTC staff have, by long-standing past practice, received<br/>their cost-of-living salary adjustments on the basis of the Department of Defense adjustment<br/>which is usually established in January of each year, and</p>
<p>Whereas, the FTA has agreed that this practice is acceptable given the unique salary<br/>structure which must be used for compensation of ROTC staff members and the unique work<br/>year for these employees, and</p>
<p>Whereas, the “stipend” portion of salary received by ROTC members was<br/>established as an offset to net income losses which would otherwise be experienced by ROTC<br/>staff when they accept this position, and</p>
<p>Whereas, the “stipend” portion of salary has not been adjusted by annual cost-of-<br/>living adjustments through what appears to be an oversight or misunderstanding by all parties.<br/>Now, therefore, it is agreed and understood by the parties as follows:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 1998, the “stipend” portion of ROTC staff members’ salaries<br/>will be adjusted from $6,000 to $6,600 annually for Associate Instructors and from $7,200 to<br/>$7,920 annually for Instructors.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “stipend” portion of salary shall be adjusted annually at the same rate as the<br/>Department of Defense cost-of-living adjustment which is applied to the salary pursuant to<br/>notification from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>COMBINATION CLASS STIPEND</p>
<p>A. Effective July 1, 2008, the stipend for bargaining unit member teaching<br/>elementary school combination classes pursuant to Article 14, Sections 14.4.2.1 to 14.4.2.3,<br/>shall be $500.00 annually.</p>
<p>1 BUY-BACK DAY COMPENSATION</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Effective July 1, 2008, the stipend for bargaining unit member attending Buy-</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back Days pursuant to Article 14, Section 14.8, shall be $238.00 for each full day of</p>
