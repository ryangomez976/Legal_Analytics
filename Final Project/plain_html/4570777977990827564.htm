<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers participating in room sharing agreements may<br/>voluntarily participate in one additional work day to<br/>prepare for MTYRE. Participating teachers will<br/>receive $100.00.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track Requests (For Traditional Schools Converting to<br/>MTYRE)</p>
<p>a. Grade level members will try to come to an agreement<br/>as to track assignments. Grade level teams must<br/>ensure that legal requirements for district school</p>
<p>programs are met (e.g. GATE, CLAD, Special Ed.,<br/>mainstream). Grade level teams are also encouraged<br/>to consider the needs of families. Teachers should<br/>use the Teaching Assignment Interest Form to indicate<br/>their track preference.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If consensus cannot be reached, the principal or<br/>vice-principal will meet with the team members for<br/>purposes of facilitating a decision by the team of<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a team decision cannot be reached, site seniority<br/>will be the determining factor as evidenced by date<br/>of hire at that site. If equal then district<br/>seniority shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal Process</p>
<p>Seniority is not a basis for an appeal. If an<br/>amicable track assignment decision cannot be reached<br/>by the site administrator/district and teacher, a<br/>secondary review process (appeal) is available.</p>
<p>The teacher requesting track assignment shall<br/>submit a written request to the Superintendent,<br/>detailing the reasons for the appeal based on<br/>criteria in Section A, above.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District teachers who would like to request a change of<br/>track/grade shall submit a written request to the<br/>principal by February 15th. This will not preclude<br/>interested teachers from applying for positions that occur<br/>after February 15th.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment for regular education classroom teachers<br/>shall not result in a change of track placement unless it<br/>is due to 1)changing enrollment or, 2)Peer Assistance and<br/>Review (PAR) panel recommendations (tenured teachers who<br/>have been referred to PAR for two consecutive years and<br/>who have not demonstrated improvement toward meeting<br/>standards).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an involuntary track and/or grade reassignment must be<br/>made for purposes of changing enrollment, the principal<br/>shall attempt to resolve which teacher must be reassigned<br/>collaboratively with the teachers in the track that is<br/>affected. If the collaborative efforts have failed, then<br/>the teacher with the least District seniority shall be<br/>changed.</p>
<p>If an involuntary track and/or grade reassignment must be<br/>made due to a PAR panel recommendation, the principal<br/>shall inform the teacher in question prior to March 1st.</p>
<p>-22-</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event changing enrollment affects more than one (1)<br/>grade level at a site and collaboration does not lead to a<br/>resolution, the least senior teacher of the grade levels<br/>affected is the last teacher placed.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who is involuntarily reassigned shall, upon<br/>written request, be given a written statement of the<br/>specific reasons why he/she was reassigned, and shall be<br/>entitled to conference if requested.</p>

The District shall call interested<br/>district teachers about substitute opportunities before<br/>calling non-district teachers. If a district teacher can<br/>not be reached on a first phone call, then the District<br/>shall call another district teacher or a non-district<br/>teacher to ask them to substitute.

<p>Presentation</p>
<p>A teacher, or representative, or both, may present a grievance<br/>while on duty. On group grievances, no more than seven (7)<br/>teachers may participate while on duty, whether grievants,<br/>representatives, or witnesses, unless otherwise approved by the<br/>District. That approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant may be represented by anyone of his/her own<br/>choosing whether or not that representative is a teacher,<br/>either in informal discussion or at any other step of this<br/>procedure.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If representation is by the Association, the grievant need<br/>not identify the particular individual except that the<br/>Association shall advise if it intends to employ counsel.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Discussion</p>
<p>The alleged violation may be discussed with the immediate<br/>supervisor. Action taken pursuant to such informal discussion<br/>shall not be deemed to set precedents for the purpose of<br/>interpreting this Agreement.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance -- Step 1 (Immediate Supervisor)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance may be initiated no later than thirty (30)<br/>workdays after the event or circumstances occasioning the<br/>grievance, if the grievant knew or should have known of<br/>the event or circumstances.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance shall be initiated in writing and filed with<br/>the immediate supervisor. This form shall be completed to<br/>show the following:</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remedy sought by the grievant(s)</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name of the grievant's representative.</p>
<p>3. Within ten (10) workdays after the initiation of the<br/>formal grievance, the immediate supervisor shall<br/>investigate the grievance, which may include a meeting,<br/>and give a written decision to the grievant. If the<br/>grievant is not represented by the Association, a copy<br/>shall be sent to the Association.</p>
<p>G. Grievance -- Step 2 (Superintendent)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision<br/>rendered pursuant to Step 1, he/she may appeal the<br/>decision, in writing, within ten (10) workdays of delivery<br/>of the Step 1 decision to the Superintendent. The<br/>grievant shall identify each aspect of the immediate<br/>supervisor's decision with which the grievant disagrees.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent/designee shall investigate the<br/>grievance as fully as necessary, and shall provide for<br/>conferences with the grievant, who shall continue to have<br/>the right of representation.</p>
<p>-45-</p>
<p>The Superintendent/designee, shall respond within ten (10)<br/>workdays of the conference with the grievant, in writing,<br/>to the grievant. That response shall state the<br/>Superintendent's view of the facts and conclusion(s)<br/>respecting the contentions of the grievant on appeal. If<br/>the grievant is not represented by the Association, a copy<br/>shall be sent to the Association.</p>
<p>Grievance -- Step 3 (Advisory Arbitration)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Superintendent, or designee, response is not<br/>satisfactory to the grievant or if no written decision has<br/>been rendered within ten (10) days after the grievant has<br/>first met with the Superintendent/designee, he/she may<br/>request in writing that the Association submit the<br/>grievance to Advisory Arbitration. The Association, by<br/>written notice to the Superintendent within fifteen (15)<br/>days after receipt of the request from the grievant, may<br/>submit the grievance to Advisory Arbitration.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree within three (3)<br/>workdays on an arbitrator, either party may submit the<br/>matter to the State Conciliation Service. On receipt of<br/>the submission, the State Conciliation Service will send<br/>the parties a list of five (5) names of available<br/>arbitrators. Those arbitrators must be members of the<br/>American Arbitration Association. The parties shall<br/>select an arbitrator by a strike-out process from that<br/>list, if they are unable to agree on one (1) of the names.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arbitrator shall proceed under the Voluntary Labor<br/>Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the<br/>grievance, such question will be ruled upon by the<br/>Arbitrator.</p>
<p>Grievance -- Step 4 (Arbitrator's Recommendation and Board</p>
<p>Action)</p>
<p>1. Within thirty (30) workdays of receipt of the Arbitrator's<br/>decision, the Board shall act to accept, reject or modify</p>
<p>the decision. If the Board declines to act within thirty<br/>(30) days, then the decision of the Arbitrator shall be<br/>deemed adopted by the Board.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may not act to reject or modify any of the<br/>Arbitrator's findings of fact without a review of the<br/>transcript of the entire hearing record, briefs and<br/>exhibits. Before adopting, modifying or rejecting the<br/>decision, the Board shall permit oral arguments by both<br/>parties, upon the request of either party.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a case where the Arbitrator's award sustains the<br/>grievant, but the Board subsequently fails to accept such<br/>recommendation and instead modifies or reverses the<br/>Arbitrator's decision and the grievant later files a<br/>judicial action against the District for breach of the<br/>Agreement, the District shall not assert as a defense that<br/>the grievant's utilization of the grievance procedure was<br/>the only proper remedy for resolution of the grievance.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the Arbitrator will be borne<br/>equally by the District and Association. All other costs will<br/>be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance at Hearing</p>
<p>The District agrees that teachers shall not suffer loss of<br/>compensation for time spent as a grievant, representative or<br/>witness at a hearing held pursuant to this procedure.</p>

<p>taking extended time off from work creates a<br/>hardship for the C/CME because he/she has or will<br/>exhaust all of his/her current and accumulated<br/>sick leave.</p>
<p>Family member is defined to include a C/CME's spouse,<br/>parent, child, and/or any other relative living in a C/CME's<br/>immediate household.</p>
