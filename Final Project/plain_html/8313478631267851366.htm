Alternate<br/>approved proposals to extend the leave past twelve (12) weeks must also state the extent of benefit coverage and employee<br/>and/or employer contribution.</p>

<p>Office, which will publish the need throughout the District. Employees who wish to donate will notify the<br/>District. When a donation is credited, the employee donating the leave will be notified of the adjustment to<br/>his or her account.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent to the donor's workday. (Donated sick leave shall be</p>
<p>converted to hours for utilization on an hour-for-hour basis. This means that the recipient shall be paid at his<br/>or her regular rate of pay for each of the hours donated.)</p>

<p>any donation of sick leave. (A year's accumulated sick leave is the equivalent of one day for each month of<br/>employment. A ten- (10) month employee, for example, would need to have a balance of ten (10) days after<br/>donation.)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;properly document and administer the provisions of this section shall be</p>

<p>C.O.B.R.A., the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, is a federal law that requires certain employers to<br/>make available to former employees and their spouses and/or dependents the opportunity to continue, at the expense of the<br/>individual, coverage of health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>Upon resignation, retirement, reduction of hours and/or termination, a former employee may continue the health and<br/>welfare benefits enjoyed as a employee for a period of eighteen (18) months by pre-paying monthly the cost of such coverage<br/>to the employer.</p>
<p>A spouse and/or eligible dependents may elect to continue, for a period of thirty-six (36) months, the health and welfare<br/>coverage provided to a former employee in the event of death, divorce and certain other conditions.</p>
<p>The only exception to the above occurs when termination is due to dismissal for gross misconduct. In such a case, extended<br/>health and welfare coverage is not available.</p>

<p>EXHIBIT D.l - FAMILY LEAVE</p>
<p>CALIFORNIA CODES GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 12945.</p>
<p>It shall be an unlawful employment practice unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any employer, because of the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition of any female employee, to refuse to<br/>promote her, or to refuse to select her for a training program leading to promotion, provided she is able to complete the<br/>training program at least three months prior to the anticipated date of departure for her pregnancy leave, or to discharge her<br/>from employment or from a training program leading to promotion, or to discriminate against her in compensation or in<br/>terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any employer to refuse to allow a female employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions<br/>either:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To receive the same benefits or privileges of employment granted by that employer to other persons not so affected who are<br/>similar in their ability or inability to work, including to take disability or sick leave or any other accrued leave which is made<br/>available by the employer to temporarily disabled employees. For purposes of this section, pregnancy, childbirth, and<br/>related medical conditions are treated as any other temporary disability. However, no employer shall be required to provide<br/>a female employee disability leave on account of normal pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition for a period<br/>exceeding six weeks. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require an employer to provide his or her employees with<br/>health insurance coverage for the medical costs of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The inclusion in any<br/>health insurance coverage of any provisions or coverage relating to medical costs of pregnancy, childbirth, or related<br/>medical conditions shall not be construed to require the inclusion of any other provisions or coverage, nor shall coverage of<br/>any related medical conditions be required by virtue of coverage of any medical costs of pregnancy, childbirth, or other<br/>related medical conditions.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a leave on account of pregnancy for a reasonable period of time not to exceed four months. The employee shall be<br/>entitled to utilize any accrued vacation leave during this period of time. Reasonable period of time means that period during<br/>which the female employee is disabled on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Nothing herein<br/>shall be construed to limit the provisions of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b). An employer may require any employee who<br/>plans to take a leave pursuant to this subdivision to give the employer reasonable notice of the date the leave shall<br/>commence and the estimated duration of the leave.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For any employer, which shall include both employers subject to and not subject to Title VII of the federal Civil Rights<br/>Act of 1964, who has a policy, practice, or collective bargaining agreement requiring or authorizing the transfer of<br/>temporarily disabled employees to less strenuous or hazardous positions for the duration of the disability to refuse to<br/>transfer a pregnant female employee who so requests.</p>
<p>(2) For any employer, which shall include both employers subject to and not subject to Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act<br/>of 1964, to refuse to temporarily transfer a pregnant female employee to a less strenuous or hazardous position for the<br/>duration of her pregnancy if she so requests, with the advice of her physician, where that transfer can be reasonably<br/>accommodated. However, no employer shall be required by this section to create additional employment that the employer<br/>would not otherwise have created, nor shall the employer be required to discharge any employee, transfer any employee<br/>with more seniority, or promote any employee who is not qualified to perform the job.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section shall not be construed to affect any other provision of law relating to sex discrimination or pregnancy, or in any<br/>way to diminish the coverage of pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth under any<br/>other provisions of this part, including subdivision (a) of Section 12940. (e) Except for paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), and<br/>paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (c), this section shall be inapplicable to any employer subject to Title VII of the federal<br/>Civil Rights Act of 1964. 12945.1. Sections 12945.2 and 19702.3 shall be known, and may be cited, as the Moore-Brown-<br/>Roberti Family Rights Act. 12945.2. (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), it shall be an unlawful employment practice<br/>for any employer, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c), to refuse to grant a request by any employee with more than<br/>12 months of service with the employer, and who has at least 1,250 hours of service with the employer during the previous<br/>12-month period, to take up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12-month period for family care and medical leave. Family<br/>care and medical leave requested pursuant to this subdivision shall not be deemed to have been granted unless the employer<br/>provides the employee, upon granting the leave request, a guarantee of employment in the same or a comparable position<br/>upon the termination of the leave. The commission shall adopt a regulation specifying the elements of a reasonable request,<br/>(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to refuse to grant a<br/>request for family care and medical leave by an employee if the employer employs less than 50 employees within 75 miles of<br/>the worksite where that employee is employed.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this section:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Child&quot; means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis<br/>who is either of the following: (A) Under 18 years of age. (B) An adult dependent child.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Employer&quot; means either of the following:</p>
<p>Board Approved June 20, 2012</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who directly employs 50 or more persons to perform services for a wage or salary.</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state, and any political or civil subdivision of the state and cities.</p>
<p>(1) &quot;Family care and medical leave&quot; means any of the following:</p>
<p>(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave for reason of the birth of a child of the employee, the placement of a child with an employee in connection with the</p>
<p>adoption or foster care of the child by the employee, or the serious health condition of a child of the employee.</p>
<p>(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave to care for a parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition.</p>
<p>Leave because of an employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the<br/>position of that employee, except for leave taken for disability on account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical<br/>conditions. (4) &quot;Employment in the same or a comparable position&quot; means employment in a position that has the same or<br/>similar duties and pay that can be performed at the same or similar geographic location as the position held prior to the leave.</p>
<p>(5) &quot;FMLA&quot; means the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-3). (6) &quot;Health care provider&quot; means any of the<br/>following: (A) An individual holding either a physician's and surgeon's certificate issued pursuant to Article 4 (commencing with<br/>Section 2080) of Chapter 5 of Division 2 of the Business and Professions Code, an osteopathic physician's and surgeon's<br/>certificate issued pursuant to Article 4.5 (commencing with Section 2099.5) of Chapter 5 of Division 2 of the Business and<br/>Professions Code, or an individual duly licensed as a physician, surgeon, or osteopathic physician or surgeon in another state or<br/>jurisdiction, who directly treats or supervises the treatment of the serious health condition. (B) Any other person determined by<br/>the United States Secretary of Labor to be capable of providing health care services under the FMLA. (7) &quot;Parent&quot; means a<br/>biological, foster, or adoptive parent, a stepparent, a legal guardian, or other person who stood in loco parentis to the employee<br/>when the employee was a child. (8) &quot;Serious health condition&quot; means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental<br/>condition that involves either of the following: (A) Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility. (B)<br/>Continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider, (d) An employer shall not be required to pay an<br/>employee for any leave taken pursuant to subdivision (a), except as required by subdivision (e). (e) An employee taking a leave<br/>permitted by subdivision (a) may elect, or an employer may require the employee, to substitute, for leave allowed under<br/>subdivision (a), any of the employee's accrued vacation leave or other accrued time off during this period or any other paid or<br/>unpaid time off negotiated with the employer. If an employee takes a leave because of the employee's own serious health<br/>condition, the employee may also elect, or the employer may also require the employee, to substitute accrued sick leave during<br/>the period of the leave. However, an employee shall not use sick leave during a period of leave in connection with the birth,<br/>adoption, or foster care of a child, or to care for a child, parent, or spouse with a serious health condition, unless mutually<br/>agreed to by the employer and the employee, (f) (1) During any period that an eligible employee takes leave pursuant to<br/>subdivision (a) or takes leave that qualifies as leave taken under the FMLA, the employer shall maintain and pay for coverage<br/>under a &quot;group health plan,&quot; as defined in Section 5000(b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, for the duration of the<br/>leave, not to exceed 12 workweeks in a 12-month period, commencing on the date leave taken under the FMLA commences, at<br/>the level and under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in employment<br/>continuously for the duration of the leave. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude an employer from maintaining and<br/>paying for coverage under a &quot;group health plan&quot; beyond 12 workweeks. An employer may recover the premium that the<br/>employer paid as required by this subdivision for maintaining coverage for the employee under the group health plan if both of<br/>the following conditions occur: (A) The employee fails to return from leave after the period of leave to which the employee is<br/>entitled has expired. (B) The employee's failure to return from leave is for a reason oilier than the continuation, recurrence, or<br/>onset of a serious health condition that entitles the employee to leave under subdivision (a) or other circumstances beyond the<br/>control of the employee.

In the absence of these conditions an employee shall continue to<br/>be entitled to participate in these plans and, in the case of health and welfare employee benefit plans, including life, short-term,<br/>or long-term disability or accident insurance, or other similar plans, the employer may, at his or her discretion, require the<br/>employee to pay premiums, at the group rate, during the period of leave not covered by any accrued vacation leave, or other<br/>accrued time off, or any other paid or unpaid time off negotiated with the employer, as a condition of continued coverage during<br/>the leave period. However, the nonpayment of premiums by an employee shall not constitute a break in service, for purposes of<br/>longevity, seniority under any collective bargaining agreement, or any employee benefit plan. For purposes of pension and<br/>retirement plans, an employer shall not be required to make plan payments for an employee during the leave period, and the<br/>leave period shall not be required to be counted for purposes of time accrued under the plan. However, an employee covered by<br/>a pension plan may continue to make contributions in accordance with the terms of the plan during the period of the leave, (g)<br/>During a family care and medical leave period, the employee shall retain employee status with the employer, and the leave shall<br/>not constitute a break in service, for purposes of longevity, seniority under any collective bargaining agreement, or any employee<br/>benefit plan. An employee returning from leave shall return with no less seniority than the employee had when the leave<br/>commenced, for purposes of layoff, recall, promotion, job assignment, and seniority-related benefits such as vacation, (h) If the<br/>employee's need for a leave pursuant to this section is foreseeable, the employee shall provide the employer with reasonable<br/>advance notice of the need for the leave, (i) If the employee's need for leave pursuant to this section is foreseeable due to a</p>

That certification shall be sufficient if it includes all of the following: (A) The date on which the<br/>serious health condition commenced. (B) The probable duration of the condition. (C) An estimate of the amount of time that the<br/>health care provider believes the employee needs to care for the individual requiring the care.

That<br/>certification shall be sufficient if it includes all of the following: (A) The date on which the serious health condition commenced.<br/>(B) The probable duration of the condition. (C) A statement that, due to the serious health condition, the employee is unable to<br/>perform the function of his or her position.

(3) (A) In any case in which the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the<br/>certification provided pursuant to this section, the employer may require, at the employer's expense, that the employee obtain<br/>the opinion of a second health care provider, designated or approved by the employer, concerning any information certified<br/>under paragraph (1). (B) The health care provider designated or approved under subparagraph (A) shall not be employed on a<br/>regular basis by the employer.

<p>&quot;NOTICE A&quot;</p>
<p>PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE</p>
<p>Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), if you are disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or related<br/>medical conditions, you are eligible to take a pregnancy disability leave (PDL). If you are affected by pregnancy or a related<br/>medical condition, you are also eligible to transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or to less strenuous or hazardous<br/>duties, if this transfer is medically advisable. You are also eligible to receive reasonable accommodation for conditions related to<br/>pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions if you request it with the advice of your health care provider.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PDL is for any period(s) of actual disability caused by your pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions up<br/>to four months (or 88 work days for a full-time employee) per pregnancy.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PDL does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time but can be taken on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time off needed for prenatal care, severe morning sickness, doctor-ordered bed rest, childbirth, and recovery from<br/>childbirth would all be covered by your PDL.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, we are required to treat your pregnancy disability the same as we treat other disabilities of similarly situated<br/>employees. This affects whether your leave will be paid or unpaid.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may be required to obtain a certification from your health care provider of your pregnancy disabihty or the medical<br/>advisability for a transfer or reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p>The certification should include:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the date on which you become disabled due to pregnancy or the date of the medical advisability for the transfer or<br/>reasonable accommodation;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the probable duration of the period(s) of disabihty or the period(s) for the advisability of the transfer or reasonable<br/>accommodation; and,</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement that, due to the disabihty, you are unable to work at all or to perform any one or more of the essential<br/>functions of your position without undue risk to yourself, the successful completion of your pregnancy or to other<br/>persons or a statement that, due to your pregnancy, the transfer or reasonable accommodation is medically advisable.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At your option, you can use any accrued vacation or other accrued time off as part of your pregnancy disabihty leave<br/>before taking the remainder of your leave as an unpaid leave. We may require that you use up any available sick leave<br/>during your leave. You may also be eligible for state disabihty insurance for the unpaid portion of your leave.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a pregnancy disabihty leave may impact certain of your benehts and your seniority date. If you want more<br/>information regarding your eligibility for a leave, the impact of the leave on your seniority and benefits, and our policy<br/>for other disabilities, please contact Barbara Stewart at 209-795-8501.

<p>&quot;NOTICE B&quot;</p>
<p>FAMILY CARE AND MEDICAL LEAVE (CFRA LEAVE)</p>
<p>AND PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the California Family Rights Act of 1993 (CFRA), if you have more than 12 months of service with us and have<br/>worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12-month period before the date you want to begin your leave, you may have a right<br/>to an unpaid family care or medical leave (CFRA leave). This leave may be up to 12 workweeks in a 12-month period<br/>for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of your child or for your own serious health condition or that of your<br/>child, parent or spouse.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are not eligible for CFRA leave, if disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, you are<br/>entitled to take a pregnancy disability leave of up to four months, depending on your period(s) of actual disability. If<br/>you are CFRA-eligible, you have certain rights to take BOTH a pregnancy disability leave and a CFRA leave for reason<br/>of the birth of your child. Both leaves contain a guarantee of reinstatement to the same or to a comparable position at<br/>the end of the leave, subject to any defense allowed under the law.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, you must provide at least 30 days advance notice for foreseeable events (such as the expected birth of a child<br/>or a planned medical treatment for yourself or of a family member). For events which are unforeseeable, we need you<br/>to notify us, at least verbally, as soon as you learn of the need for the leave.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to comply with these notice rules is grounds for, and may result in, deferral of the requested leave until you<br/>comply with this notice policy.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may require certification from your health care provider before allowing you a leave for pregnancy or your own<br/>serious health condition or certification from the health care provider of your child, parent, or spouse who has a serious<br/>health condition before allowing you a leave to take care of that family member. When medically necessary, leave may<br/>be taken on an intermittent or a reduced work schedule.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are taking a leave for the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child, the basic minimum duration of the<br/>leave is two weeks and you must conclude the leave within one year of the birth or placement for adoption or foster<br/>care.</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a family care or pregnancy disability leave may impact certain of your benefits and your seniority date. If you<br/>want more information regarding your eligibility for a leave and/or the impact of the leave on your seniority and<br/>benefits, please contact 209-795-8500.

<p>EXHIBIT E - WORKERS'COMPENSATION</p>
<p>Education Code 44984</p>
<p>Governing boards of school districts shall provide by rules and regulations for industrial accident and illness leaves of<br/>absence for all certificated employees. The governing board of any district which is created or whose boundaries or<br/>status is changed by an action to organize or reorganize districts completed after the effective date of this section shall<br/>provide by rules and regulations for such leaves of absence on or before the date on which the organization or<br/>reorganization of the district becomes effective for all purposes as provided in Section 4064. Such rules or regulations<br/>shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall be for not less than 60 days during which the schools of the district are required to be in session<br/>or when the employee would otherwise have been performing work for the district in any one fiscal year for the same<br/>accident;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of absence;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a certificated employee is absent from his duties on account of an industrial accident or illness, he shall be paid<br/>such portion of the salary due him for any month in which the absence occurs as, when added to his temporary<br/>disability indemnity under Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a payment to him of not more<br/>than his full salary;</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;full salary&quot; as utilized in this subdivision shall be computed so that it shall not be less than the employee's<br/>&quot;average weekly earnings&quot; as that phrase is utilized in Section 4453 of the Labor Code. For purposes of this section,<br/>however, the maximum and minimum average weekly earnings set forth in Section 4453 of the Labor Code shall<br/>otherwise not be deemed applicable.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of authorized absence regardless of a<br/>temporary disability indemnity award;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only<br/>the amount of unused leave due him for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the employee shall be entitled to the benefits provided in<br/>Sections 44977,44978 and 44983, and for the purposes of each of these sections, his absence shall be deemed to have<br/>commenced on the date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, provided that if the employee<br/>continues to receive temporary disability indemnity, he may elect to take as much of his accumulated sick leave which,<br/>when added to his temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to him of not more than his full salary.</p>
<p>The governing board may, by rule or regulation, provide for such additional leave of absence for industrial accident or<br/>illness as it deems appropriate.</p>
<p>During any paid leave of absence, the employee may endorse to the district the temporary disability indemnity checks<br/>received on account of his industrial accident or illness. The district, in turn, shall issue the employee appropriate salary<br/>warrants for payment of the employee's salary and shall deduct normal retirement, other authorized contributions, and<br/>the temporary disability indemnity, if any, actually paid to and retained by the employee for periods covered by such<br/>salary warrants.</p>
<p>Any employee receiving benefits as a result of this section shall, during periods of injury or illness, remain within the<br/>State of California unless the governing board authorizes travel outside the state.</p>
<p>In the absence of rules and regulations adopted by the governing board pursuant to this section an employee shall be<br/>entitled to industrial accident or illness leave as provided in this section but without limitation as to the number of days<br/>of such leave.</p>

If the classes or duties continue beyond the first three<br/>school months of any school term or four school months for special day and evening classes for adults, or schools for migratory<br/>population, the certificated employee, unless a permanent employee shall be classified as a probationary employee. The school year<br/>may be divided into not more than two school terms for the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governing boards shall classify as temporary employees persons, other than substitute employees, who are employed to serve in a<br/>limited assignment supervising athletic activities of pupils; provided, such assignment shall first be made available to teachers presently<br/>employed by the district. Service pursuant to this subdivision shall not be included in computing the service required as a prerequisite<br/>to attainment of, or eligibility to, classification as a permanent employee of a school district.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any district, the governing board may, to prevent the stoppage of school district business when an actual emergency arises and<br/>persons are not immediately available for probationary classification, make an appointment to a position on a temporary basis for a<br/>period not to exceed 20 working days. The person so appointed shall be deemed to be a temporary employee who is employed to serve<br/>from day to day. Service by a person in such an appointment on a temporary basis shall not be included in computing the service<br/>required as a prerequisite to attainment of, or eligibility to, classification as a permanent employee of a school district.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 44917 and 44919, the governing board of a school district may employ as a teacher, for a<br/>complete school year, but not less than one semester during a school year unless the date of rendering first paid service begins during<br/>the second semester and prior to March 15th, any person holding appropriate certification documents, and may classify such person as<br/>a temporary employee. The employment of such persons shall be based upon the need for additional certificated employees during a<br/>particular semester or year because a certificated employee has been granted leave for a semester or year, or is experiencing long-term<br/>illness, and shall be limited, in number of persons so employed, to that need, as determined by the governing board.</p>
<p>Any person employed for one complete school year as a temporary employee shall, if reemployed for the following school year in a<br/>vacant position requiring certification qualifications, be classified by the governing board as a probationary employee and the previous<br/>year's employment as a temporary employee shall be deemed one year's employment as a probationary employee for purposes of<br/>acquiring permanent status.</p>
<p>For purposes of this section &quot;vacant position&quot; means a position in which the employee is qualified to serve and which is not filled by a<br/>permanent or probationary employee.

<p>Subsection (b), For those Certificated Employees<br/>Who Share the Same First Date of Paid Service as a<br/>Probationary Certificated Employee_</p>
<p>Resolution No. 10-11-23</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Education Code section 44955 authorizes a school district to reduce the number of certificated staff<br/>members for the following reasons:</p>
<p>“Whenever in any school year the average daily attendance in all of the schools of a district for the first six months in<br/>which school is in session shall have declined below the corresponding period of either of the previous two school years,<br/>whenever the governing board determines that attendance in a district will decline in the following year as a result of the<br/>termination of an Interdistrict tuition agreement as defined in Section 46304, whenever a particular kind of service is to<br/>be reduced or discontinued not later than the beginning of the following school year, or whenever the amendment of<br/>state law requires the modification of curriculum, and when in the opinion of the governing board of the district it shall<br/>have become necessary by reason of any of these conditions to decrease the number of permanent employees in the<br/>district, the governing board may terminate the services of not more than a corresponding percentage of the certificated<br/>employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the school year.”</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Education Code section 44955 further provides that:</p>
<p>“... [e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, the services of no permanent employee may be terminated under the<br/>provisions of this section while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to<br/>render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.”</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, seniority is determined by the first date of paid service as a probationary certificated employee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, if two or more certificated staff share the same seniority date and the Vallecito Union School District<br/>Governing Board (“Governing Board”) does not need to layoff all of the certificated staff members who share the same seniority date,<br/>Education Code section 44955, subsection (b), provides, in part, that:</p>
<p>“... As between employees who first rendered paid service to the district on the same date, the governing board shall<br/>determine the order of termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof.”</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, if the Vallecito Union School District Administration (“Administration”) issues a layoff notice to one or<br/>more members of a group of certificated employees who share the same first date of paid service as a probationary certificated employee,<br/>the Administration must comply with Education Code section 44955, subdivision (b), which provides, in part, that:</p>
<p>“... Upon the request of any employee ..., the governing board shall furnish in writing no later than five days prior to the<br/>commencement of the hearing held in accordance with Section 44949, a statement of the specific criteria used in<br/>determining the order of termination and the application of the criteria in ranking each employee relative to the other<br/>employees in the group.”</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Vallecito Union School District Administration recommends that the Governing Board adopt the<br/>following criteria and the following application to that criteria for the 2010-2011 school year for determining the order of termination<br/>between or amongst employees who share the same first date of paid service as a probationary employee for making employment related<br/>decisions for the 2011-2012 school year:</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between those employees who have equal qualifications based on the application of the criteria set forth in<br/>Paragraph 6 above, the Governing Board shall assign each person one (1) point per school year per subject that<br/>he or she has taught that required a single subject credential or supplementary authorization [The District shall<br/>not apply any points to a person who was teaching two or more subjects to the same group of students with a<br/>multiple subjects credential],</p>

<p>EDUCATION CODE 44955</p>
<p>44955. (a) No permanent employee shall be deprived of his or her position for causes other than those specified in<br/>Sections 44907 and 44923, and Sections 44932 to 44947, inclusive, and no probationary employee shall be deprived of<br/>his or her position for cause other than as specified in Sections 44948 to 44949, inclusive.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever in any school year the average daily attendance in all of the schools of a district for the first six months<br/>in which school is in session shall have declined below the corresponding period of either of the previous two school<br/>years, whenever the governing board determines that attendance in a district will decline in the following year as a<br/>result of the termination of an Interdistrict tuition agreement as defined in Section 46304, whenever a particular kind<br/>of service is to be reduced or discontinued not later than the beginning of the following school year, or whenever the<br/>amendment of state law requires the modification of curriculum, and when in the opinion of the governing board of the<br/>district it shall have become necessary by reason of any of these conditions to decrease the number of permanent<br/>employees in the district, the governing board may terminate the services of not more than a corresponding percentage<br/>of the certificated employees of the district, permanent as well as probationary, at the close of the school year. Except<br/>as otherwise provided by statute, the services of no permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this<br/>section while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service<br/>which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.</p>
<p>In computing a decline in average daily attendance for purposes of this section for a newly formed or reorganized<br/>school district, each school of the district shall be deemed to have been a school of the newly formed or reorganized<br/>district for both of the two previous school years.</p>
<p>As between employees who first rendered paid service to the district on the same date, the governing board shall<br/>determine the order of termination solely on the basis of needs of the district and the students thereof. Upon the<br/>request of any employee whose order of termination is so determined, the governing board shall furnish in writing no<br/>later than five days prior to the commencement of the hearing held in accordance with Section 44949, a statement of<br/>the specific criteria used in determining the order of termination and the application of the criteria in ranking each<br/>employee relative to the other employees in the group. This requirement that the governing board provide, on request,<br/>a written statement of reasons for determining the order of termination shall not be interpreted to give affected<br/>employees any legal right or interest that would not exist without such a requirement.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of such termination of services shall be given before the 15th of May in the manner prescribed in Section<br/>44949, and services of such employees shall be terminated in the inverse of the order in which they were employed, as<br/>determined by the board in accordance with the provisions of Sections 44844 and 44845. In the event that a permanent<br/>or probationary employee is not given the notices and a right to a hearing as provided for in Section 44949, he or she<br/>shall be deemed reemployed for the ensuing school year.</p>
<p>The governing board shall make assignments and reassignments in such a manner that employees shall be retained<br/>to render any service which their seniority and qualifications entitle them to render. However, prior to assigning or<br/>reassigning any certificated employee to teach a subject which he or she has not previously taught, and for which he or<br/>she does not have a teaching credential or which is not within the employee's major area of postsecondary study or the<br/>equivalent thereof, the governing board shall require the employee to pass a subject matter competency test in the<br/>appropriate subject.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a school district may deviate from terminating a certificated employee in order of<br/>seniority for either of the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district demonstrates a specific need for personnel to teach a specific course or course of study, or to provide<br/>services authorized by a services credential with a specialization in either pupil personnel services or health for a school<br/>nurse, and that the certificated employee has special training and experience necessary to teach that course or course of<br/>study or to provide those services, which others with more seniority do not possess.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of maintaining or achieving compliance with constitutional requirements related to equal protection<br/>of the laws.</p>

<p>Board approved June 20, 2012</p>
<p>REDUCED WORKLOAD PROGRAM</p>
<p>The CalSTRS Reduced Workload Program allows eligible members to reduce their workload from full-time to part-time<br/>duties (a minimum of 50 percent of full time) for up to ten years, normally the last ten years before retirement.</p>
<p>You will receive full-time service credit, while working less than full time. At the time of retirement, your allowance will<br/>be calculated as though you continued to work full time.</p>
<p>You must be age 55 or older, have been employed full time for a minimum of 10 years performing creditable service and<br/>have been employed full-time performing creditable service five consecutive years immediately prior to entering the<br/>program.</p>
<p>Both member and employer contributions are paid on the full-time eamable salary, rather than the actual part-time salary<br/>earned while participating in the program. Therefore, the employer will be required to pay a higher contribution rate for a<br/>member to participate.</p>
<p>The consequences of failing to work at least 50 percent as required by the program can be significant. This occurs if the<br/>member does not earn creditable compensation for at least 50 percent of full-time in any one school year. Service credit<br/>for the year will be calculated on actual time worked.</p>
<p>For example, a member who was employed 50 percent of full time had her pay docked because she became ill and ran<br/>out of sick leave. Consequently, she failed to perform creditable service for at least 50 percent of full time that year.<br/>Therefore, for that year she did not earn the service credit of one year but rather received credit only for the actual time<br/>worked.</p>
<p>Retiring before the end of the school year can also impact program participants in the Reduced Workload Program.</p>
<p>After discussing the Reduced Workload Program with your employer and reviewing personal qualifications, you must<br/>enter into a contractual agreement with your employer to participate.</p>

<p>FXHTBTTO.1</p>
<p>44922. Notwithstanding any other provision, the governing board of a school district or a county superintendent of schools<br/>may establish regulations which allow their certificated employees to reduce their workload from full-time to part-time duties.</p>
<p>The regulations shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following, if the employees wish to reduce their workload and<br/>maintain retirement benefits pursuant to Section 22713 of this code or Section 20815 of the Government Code:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall have reached the age of 55 prior to reduction in workload.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall have been employed full time in a position requiring certification for at least 10 years of which the<br/>immediately preceding five years were full-time employment.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period immediately preceding a request for a reduction in workload, the employee shall have been employed full<br/>time in a position requiring certification for a total of at least five years without a break in service. For purposes of this subdivision,<br/>sabbaticals and other approved leaves of absence shall not constitute a break in service.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment shall be exercised at the request of the employee and can be revoked only with the mutual<br/>consent of the employer and the employee.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The employee shall be paid a salary that is the pro rata share of the salary he or she would be earning had he or she not<br/>elected to exercise the option of part-time employment but shall retain all other rights and benefits for which he or she makes the<br/>payments that would be required if he or she remained in full-time employment.</p>
<p>(2) The employee shall receive health benefits as provided in Section 53201 of the Government Code in the same manner as a full¬<br/>time employee.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum part-time employment shall be the equivalent of one-half of the number of days of service required by the<br/>employee's contract of employment during his or her final year of service in a full-time position.</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This option is limited in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 to certificated employees who do not hold positions with salaries<br/>above that of a school principal.</p>
<p>(h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of this part-time employment shall include a period of time, as specified in the regulations, which shall be up to<br/>and include five years for employees subject to Section 20815 of the Government Code or 10 years for employees subject to Section<br/>22713 of this code.</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of part-time employment of employees subject to Section 20815 of the Government Code shall not extend beyond<br/>the end of the school year during which the employee reaches his or her 70<sup>th</sup> birthday. This subdivision shall not apply to any<br/>employee subject to Section 22713 of this code.</p>
