<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee taking unpaid family care leave pursuant to this provision shall<br/>continue to be entitled to participate in health plans and other benefits to the same<br/>extent and under the same conditions as apply to other unpaid leaves of absence.<br/>The District requires the employee to contribute the cost of all health and welfare<br/>benefits during any unpaid family care leave. <sup>30</sup></p>
<p>30</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may refuse to grant an employee’s request for unpaid family care leave<br/>under this provision even though all requirements of this provision have been<br/>satisfied (a) if the refusal is necessary to prevent undue hardship to the operations<br/>of the District, (I?) if the employee and the other parent would receive unpaid<br/>family care leave exceeding four (4) months in any twenty-four (24) month period,<br/>or (c) if the other parent is also taking family care leave at the same time or is<br/>unemployed.</p>

<p>Employees who have completed twenty (20) cumulative full-time years of District<br/>service will, upon being granted part-time employment, be eligible to receive the<br/>same level of health and dental coverage as full-time employees per “A”, “B” and<br/>“C” above. <sup>41</sup></p>
<p>41</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXI11</p>
<p>DONATION OF LEAVE FOR CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS</p>
<p>Upon written request, the District may authorize bargaining unit members to donate up to a<br/>cumulative of five (5) workdays of earned sick leave or accrued vacation to an employee as<br/>eligible leave credits when that employee or that employee’s family member suffers from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury. The District will consider each request on a case-by-case basis,<br/>considering both the circumstances of the employee and financial constraints of the District.<br/>The donation and receipt of such credits are subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness or injury” is defined to mean an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate an employee or a member of an employee’s family for an extended period<br/>of time, which incapacity requires the employee to take time off from work or care for<br/>that family member for an extended period of time, and taking extended time off work<br/>creates a financial hardship for the employee because he or she has exhausted all of his<br/>or her sick leave and other paid time off.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Extended period of time” is defined to mean more dian twenty (20) consecutive<br/>workdays.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Eligible leave credits” are defined to mean vacation leave and sick leave accrued to the<br/>donating employee, to the extent that the employee is otherwise eligible to use such<br/>leave. An employee cannot donate future vacation leave and sick leave that has not<br/>been accrued. Nothing in tliis Section o catastrophic leave expands the purposes for<br/>which sick leave can be used under other applicable provisions of this Agreement,<br/>District policy, and applicable law.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Family member” is defined to mean the employee’s spouse, parents, parents-in-law,<br/>siblings, children, and step children.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who is, or whose family member is, suffering from a catastrophic illness<br/>or injury and who is requesting that eligible leave credits be donated:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must request in writing to the District Office that eligible leave credits be donated.<br/>The request must be submitted at least ten (10) calendar days before the employee<br/>wishes to use the donated leave credits.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must provide written verification of the catastrophic injury or illness by a<br/>physician, the District may request die employee who is incapacitated to undergo<br/>examination by a physician selected by the District, at the District’s expense, to<br/>verify the injury or illness, the degree of disability, and the anticipated length of<br/>disability.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must exhaust all accrued paid leave credits, including all days of partial pay sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must use all leave credit that he or she continues to accrue on a mondily basis<br/>before receiving paid leave credits that are donated under this provision. <sup>42</sup></p>
<p>42</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who chooses to donate eligible leave credits:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must provide written notice to the District Office of the intent to transfer the<br/>eligible leave credits.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must donate eligible leave credits of a minimum of the definition of a total<br/>workday.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must acknowledge in writing to the District Office that the employee understands<br/>that he or she cannot revoke the donation of die eligible leave credits because all<br/>transfers of eligible leave credits are irrevocable and binding. The donating<br/>employee must sign and date this acknowledgment.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one employee in the bargaining unit may donate eligible leave credits to the<br/>requesting employee. The cumulative maximum number of workdays the requesting<br/>employee may receive is thirty workdays plus one workday for every full year the<br/>requesting employee has been employed in the District.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will determine whether the employee is eligible to receive leave credits due<br/>to the employee’s (or his or her family member’s) catastrophic illness or injury. If the<br/>District determines that the employee is able to work, die District may deny the<br/>employee’s request to receive donated leave credits.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee receiving die donating employee’s hours may use the donated leave<br/>credits for a maximum period of thirty consecutive workdays plus one workday for<br/>every full year the requesting employee has been employed by the District.</p>
<p>}. The employee receiving the donated hours may only receive and use donated hours<br/>once.</p>
<p>K. The District’s decision to deny the employee’s request to receive donated leave credits<br/>is final and is not subject to review or appeal under die grievance or any other<br/>procedure. <sup>43</sup></p>
<p>43</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXIV</p>
<p>FUTURE RETIREES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future retirees may participate in District Health, Vision, and Dental Plans subject to<br/>the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree has been employed by the District and has completed at least ten (10)<br/>years of cumulative full-time service. Sabbaticals or granted leaves of absence shall<br/>not be considered as an interruption of sendee nor as a year of service. A<br/>resignation shall be considered as a break in service. Any years of sendee prior to<br/>being re-hired shall not be included in any accmal or cumulative calculation of<br/>service. In the case of a part-time employee (including an employee on a STRS<br/>Reduced Workload agreement), the actual percentage of FTE worked will be used<br/>for the employee’s cumulative FTE calculation.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of calculating years of sendee under tins Article, any active<br/>permanent or temporary certificated employee, who previously resigned,<br/>had a break in service, and was rehired by the District prior to 5/1/10, shall<br/>be allowed to count all certificated (classified &amp; substitute hours excluded)<br/>FTE years of service accrued in tire District prior to resigning and being<br/>rehired as a certificated employee. Seniority date does not change because of<br/>this provision and remains the date of last hire.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee will be required to furnish supporting<br/>documentation to the District prior to their retirement date should they<br/>claim a discrepancy in years of sendee after the District’s review of all<br/>existing personnel, payroll and S IRS documents.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree has attained the age of fifty (50) years or more.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiree will pay the required premium for coverage, in advance, in quarterly<br/>payments to the District. The District will pay the minimum portion, if any, of the<br/>premium required by the carrier for these coverages. The retiree will pay any additional<br/>premium required for dependents.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical only benefits provided by this Amendment shall be pursuant to the plan<br/>and coverage effective at tire time of use and not necessarily at the time of retirement.<br/>This Amendment does not guarantee any specific medical plan or coverage, but does<br/>guarantee the medical plan and coverage which will be available to active certificated<br/>employees in the future. <sup>44</sup></p>
<p>44</p>
<p>D. Certificated employees who retire pursuant to the laws and regulations governing the<br/>State Teachers Retirement System (STRS), and who have served the District for not less<br/>than ten (10) cumulative full-time years, prior to approved retirement shall be entitled to<br/>the retirement benefits in accordance with the schedule below upon written request to<br/>the District.

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of contribution by the District toward the medical only benefits (per “D”<br/>above) shall be no more than the cap on the District contribution for active bargaining<br/>unit members as negotiated by the ATP. If a retired employee covered by this<br/>Amendment is eligible and does select a more expensive coverage or an allowable and<br/>additional possible coverage, the retiree shall pay for all of the additional cost beyond<br/>the District’s maximum contribution.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the retirement benefits in provisions A through E, Certificated employees<br/>who retire pursuant to the laws and regulations of STRS, and who have served the<br/>District as certificated employees for not less dian ten (10) cumulative full-time years<br/>prior to approved retirement may elect to receive the retirement termination pay in<br/>accordance with the schedule included in “D” above, upon written request to the<br/>District. This retirement termination pay shall be paid into the PUHSD Termination<br/>Pay Conversion Plan for immediate 100% vesting on the retiree’s behalf within 30 days<br/>after the final salary payment to the employee. In the event the plan participant (the<br/>retiree) dies before the funds have been withdrawn, the account shall be transferred to<br/>the spouse or dependent (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code). If there is no<br/>dependent or spouse, the remaining funds shall be returned to the employer. The<br/>employer shall issue a check payable to the participant’s estate equal to the balance in<br/>the account less all applicable payroll taxes.</p>
<p>G. By the second Friday in January, after staff returns from the winter recess, if a teacher,<br/>who qualifies in “A,” above, notifies the District in writing of his/her intention to retire<br/>in that year, he/she will receive an additional sum of three thousand dollars ($3,000)<br/>following retirement.</p>
<p>FI. The District may negotiate unilaterally with individual retirees for compensation of services<br/>rendered to the District post-retirement, which are mutually beneficial to the retiree and the<br/>District. <sup>45</sup></p>
<p>45</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees who have met the years of service per “A” above, but who have<br/>been working in a part-time capacity, shall have the choice of benefits per “E”<br/>distributed on a pro-rated basis, calculated on their cumulative years of service per “D”<br/>above.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is effective with the 2010-2011 school year. <sup>46</sup></p>
