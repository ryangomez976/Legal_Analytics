This amount is to be jointly funded by the District and all<br/>bargaining unit members represented by the LEA bargaining unit. The amount of funding by the<br/>bargaining unit members represented by the LEA bargaining unit was achieved by reducing the 90/91<br/>salary schedule by $125 (one hundred twenty-five dollars) per cell and that dollar amount became the<br/>contribution to the trust by all bargaining unit members represented by the LEA bargaining unit. No<br/>bargaining unit member shall have a vested right in or have any entitlement to the amounts<br/>contributed into the trust fund in the form of a cash distribution.</p>
<p>23.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall deposit said funds by August 1st of each fiscal year based on the projected number<br/>of full time equivalents of all bargaining unit members represented by the LEA bargaining unit.</p>
<p>23.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual number of full time equivalents referred to in Section 23.3 shall be the number of<br/>bargaining unit members represented by the LEA bargaining unit who are employed on October 31st<br/>of each year.

Further, after said execution, any disputes regarding retiree medical, dental<br/>and/or vision benefits or actions of the Board of Directors shall not be subject to the<br/>grievance/arbitration procedures of any collective bargaining agreement between the District and<br/>LEA.</p>
<p>23.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be eligible to qualify for benefits, retirees must have been employed for the minimum or<br/>equivalent of ten years of full time service, retire under STRS or PERS and maintain medical, dental<br/>and/or vision coverage under any plan which is available to District employees in the LEA unit<br/>subject to restrictions placed by insurance carriers.

The Retiree Health Benefit Trust Board of Directors detennines the amount of the benefit on<br/>a yearly basis and notifies the eligible retirees of the current amount.</p>

<p>1. Student contact hours required beyond the normal teaching day and within the season. This category is defined<br/>to include those hours when the advisor/coach is in direct contact with students on a regular basis and includes<br/>practice time, dressing time, performance time, and travel time. Listed below are the number of points given for<br/>student contact hours.</p>

</table>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average number of students per advisor/coach. The number of students to be considered in awarding points<br/>represents the average number of student participants involved during the mid-point of the sport or activity season.<br/>In addition, one student manager is allowed toward the student total per team.</p>
<p>In determining the number of points to be awarded for each position, the number of advisors/coaches involved in an<br/>activity is divided into the number of student participants to determine the student to advisor/coach ratio. Points are<br/>awarded as indicated below:</p>
<p>I- 10 students&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 point</p>
<p>II- 18 students&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points</p>
<p>19-27 students &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points</p>
<p>28 + students &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation time. Hours counted in this category include reasonable pre-activity preparation and/or planning.<br/>Since it would be impossible to get an accurate count of the actual hours, five categories have been developed. In<br/>this category, odd-numbered values are given in order to eliminate fine distinctions between the broad categories.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand and agree that the bargaining unit member domestic partner may make health plan and other<br/>benefit elections on behalf of the non-unit member domestic partner.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand and agree that the bargaining unit member domestic partner may terminate the domestic partner<br/>benefits unilaterally, at any time, irrespective of the desires of the non-unit member.

Furthermore, if<br/>the bargaining unit member is terminated, released, or resigns the domestic partnership benefits shall terminate<br/>when District paid bargaining unit member benefits terminate.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that a civil action may be brought against one or both of us for any losses or claims (as well as<br/>attorney’s fees and costs) due to any false statement contained in this Affidavit or for failure to notify the<br/>Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District, of changed circumstances as required in Section III above. I,<br/>the undersigned bargaining unit member, further understand that falsification of information in this Affidavit or<br/>failure to notify the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District of changes circumstances pursuant to<br/>Section III above, may lead to disciplinary action against me, including discharge from employment.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that this Affidavit may have legal implications under California law which has recognized that<br/>non-marital cohabiting couples may privately contract with respect to the financial obligations of their<br/>relationship.
