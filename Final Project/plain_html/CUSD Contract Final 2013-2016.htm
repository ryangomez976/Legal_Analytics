<p>It is the intent of both the District and the Association that this agreement be a living document,<br/>and, as concerns arise, both parties may meet upon mutual agreement and resolve issues,<br/>including the revision of contract articles. Further, it is agreed that both parties agree to meet on<br/>a monthly basis at mutually agreeable dates and times to discuss issues of concern to either party.</p>
<p>ARTICLE II</p>
<p>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District confirms its recognition of the Association as the exclusive representative for<br/>the unit of unit members certified by the Public Employment Relations Board in Case(s) S-R 866<br/>&amp; S-I-106. dated November 27. 1989.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Unit&quot; for the purposes of recognition and exclusive representation shall be defined<br/>to include all certificated employees of the District, excluding all management, supervisory and<br/>confidential employees as defined by the Act.</p>
<p>ARTICLE III</p>
<p>PAYROLL DEDUCTION AND DUES</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the rights of unit members to form, join, and<br/>participate in lawful activities of employee organizations and the equal, alternative right of<br/>employees to refuse to form, join and participate in employee organizations.</p>

<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such deduction shall be made only upon submission of the authorized CTA form to the<br/>designated representative of the District, duly completed and executed by the unit member and<br/>the Association.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed, or discontinued<br/>deduction until the pay period commencing thirty (30) days after such submission.</p>

<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall submit reimbursement requests on the form attached hereto as<br/>Appendix &quot;A.&quot; Reimbursement requests may only be submitted during the school year in which<br/>the expenditure is made.

<p>ARTICLE V<br/>COMPLAINT PROCEDURE</p>
<p>In order to promote fair communication and an orderly process, the following procedures shall<br/>govern the resolution of complaints against school personnel. Every effort should be made to<br/>resolve a complaint at the earliest possible stage. Failure to observe the provisions of this<br/>regulation, including the time deadlines, shall result in the dismissal of the complaint.</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints by a non-employee against an employee should be made directly by the<br/>complainant to the person against whom the complaint is lodged. Parents/guardians are<br/>encouraged to attempt to resolve concerns directly with the staff member. The appropriate<br/>processing of the complaints concerning unit members shall be from the complainant to the unit<br/>member to the Principal to the Superintendent to the Governing Board. Complaints presented to<br/>the Governing Board must be submitted in writing. A meeting must be held with the staff<br/>member within 10 workdays of a specific incident(s).</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of a complaint by the Principal he/she shall direct the complainant to meet<br/>with the unit member if they have not already met and shall inform the unit member of the<br/>complaint. If the complainant refuses to meet with the unit member, the principal may meet with<br/>complainant. The principal will take no action regarding the complaint until he/she has met with<br/>the unit member and discussed the complaint.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of a complaint by the Superintendent he/she shall direct the complainant to<br/>meet with the Principal if they have not already met.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Association and District representative may be present at the meeting between<br/>complainant and the unit member.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of any written complaint received by the District regarding the unit member shall<br/>be provided to the unit member within 3 workdays.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint is not resolved at the Superintendent’s level, and the complainant desires<br/>to have the complaint heard by the Governing Board, he/she shall reduce the complaint to<br/>writing within 30 workdays.</p>
<p>5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be given notification of the time, date, and place of any Governing<br/>Board meeting at which the Governing Board will hear the complaint. The unit member shall<br/>have the right to be represented at the meeting.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to Informal Discussion</p>
<p>Nothing within this procedure shall be construed to limit the right of a certificated</p>
<p>employee to informally discuss any employment problem with the Superintendent.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Grievance” is defined as an allegation by the Association, or one or more<br/>members of the Association, that there has been a violation or<br/>misapplication of the specific provisions of this Agreement. Actions to<br/>challenge or change the policies, regulations or other matters outside this<br/>Agreement are not within the scope of this procedure.</p>
<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Day” is a day that the certificated employees are scheduled to work per<br/>the school calendar for each year.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levels of Procedure</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I: The grievant will exercise best efforts to meet with the Principal<br/>to resolve a grievance before filing a formal grievance under this Level I.<br/>Within thirty (30) calendar days of the occurrence of the act or omission<br/>which gives rise to the grievance, the grievant must present such grievance<br/>in writing on the appropriate form to the District Principal or designee.</p>
<p>The grievance shall consist of (1) a clear and concise statement of the<br/>problem; (2) the specific provision of the Agreement involved; and (3) the<br/>specific remedy sought. The District Principal shall communicate a<br/>written decision within ten (10) days of receipt of the grievance.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, or if<br/>the District Principal does not respond within the timelines as required by<br/>Level I, then within ten (10) days after receipt of the Level I response or<br/>the expiration of the time within which the Principal must respond, the<br/>grievant may then appeal the decision, or lack thereof, on the appropriate<br/>form to the Superintendent. The District Superintendent shall</p>
<p>communicate a written response within ten (10) days of receipt of the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>6.3.3 Level III: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, or if<br/>the District Superintendent does not respond within the timelines required<br/>by Level II, then within five (5) days after the receipt of the Level II<br/>response or the expiration of time within which the Superintendent must<br/>respond, the grievant may then appeal the decision, or lack thereof, on the<br/>appropriate form to the Board of Trustees. Upon receipt of an appeal from<br/>the grievant to the Board of Trustees, the Board of Trustees shall schedule<br/>a meeting at which the grievant will be heard.</p>
<p>After the hearing before the Board of Trustees, the Board of Trustees shall render<br/>a decision on the grievance and send same to the Superintendent and the grievant. The Board<br/>alone has the power to render a final and binding determination of the grievance, subject to<br/>judicial review which must be filed no later than 60 calendar days after the date the decision of<br/>the Board of Trustees is mailed or delivered to the grievant. The governing board may reopen<br/>the record for the taking of additional evidence.</p>
<p>6.4 General Provisions</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant shall be present at all stages of the proceeding of the<br/>grievance, unless illness, accident or death in the immediate family occurs.</p>
<p>6.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision rendered at any step during the grievance procedure becomes<br/>final unless appealed within the time limit specified. The time limits<br/>specified at each level should be considered to be maximums. The time<br/>limits may, however, be extended by mutual written agreement. Time is<br/>of the essence to all provisions.</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year, and could, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following<br/>school year, result in harm to the grievant, the time limits set forth herein<br/>may be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted as close to the end<br/>of the school year as possible. The grievant shall process the grievance<br/>during the summer months if so requested by the District.</p>
<p>6.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits for appeal provided in each level shall begin the day following<br/>the receipt of the written decision. If the grievant does not appeal a<br/>decision within the timelines allowed then the grievance shall be deemed<br/>resolved.</p>
<p>6.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing<br/>of a grievance shall be filed in a separate grievance file.</p>
<p>6.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the same complaint, or substantially the same complaint, is made by<br/>more than one employee against the District, only one employee, on<br/>behalf of himself/herself and the other complainants, may process the<br/>grievance or complaint through the grievance procedure. The names and<br/>signatures of all aggrieved parties shall appear on all documents related to<br/>the processing of the grievance.</p>
<p>6.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District or the grievant may, at any step in the formal leave, have one<br/>other person serve as a representative and to be present during the<br/>proceeding.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The District hereby establishes these provisions regarding catastrophic leave for certificated<br/>employees. This policy is only applicable to certificated employees of the District who are<br/>employed as probationary, permanent, or as administrators, including the Superintendent.</p>
<p>11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Illness or Injury: Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or<br/>injury that is expected to incapacitate the certificated employee for an extended period of time,</p>
<p>i.e. at least 10 working days or longer, or that incapacitates a family member of a certificated<br/>employee for such period of time and which requires the certificated employee to take time off<br/>from work for an extended period of time of at least 10 working days to care for himself or<br/>herself or to care for the certificated employee’s family member and the taking of extended time<br/>off work without pay creates a financial hardship for the certificated employee because he or she<br/>has exhausted all of her sick leave and accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated Sick Leave: Donated sick leave means accrued and unused sick leave of a<br/>certificated employee of the District donated to the sick leave bank.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure for Donating Regular Sick Leave:</p>
<p>11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee may donate sick leave days only if he/she has a<br/>minimum of ten days of accumulated sick leave and may donate only days<br/>in excess of that ten days, subject to “C” below.</p>
<p>11.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be authorized in writing by the certificated employee.</p>
<p>11.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees must donate sick leave in increments of 1 day and<br/>no more than 2 days of sick leave during any school year.</p>
<p>11.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential donors who were employed in a certificated position covered by<br/>STRS prior to July 1, 1980, are advised to consider the retirement<br/>implications of donating their unused sick leave credit for the Catastrophic<br/>Sick Leave Program.</p>
<p>11.4</p>
<p>Procedure for Requesting Sick Leave Credit:</p>
<p>11.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee desiring Catastrophic Sick Leave credit shall<br/>submit a request to the District Office with verification from a medical<br/>doctor of the illness.</p>
<p>11.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee who receives sick leave credit pursuant to this<br/>section shall use any leave credits that he/she continues to accrue on a<br/>monthly basis prior to receiving paid leave pursuant to this section.</p>
<p>11.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of donated sick leave credit that may be used by an<br/>individual under this section shall be 20 days during a 12 month period.</p>
<p>11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility Procedures: Eligible sick leave may be donated to a certificated employee<br/>for a catastrophic illness or injury if all of the following requirements are met:</p>
<p>11.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee who is or whose family member is suffering<br/>from a catastrophic illness or injury requests that eligible leave credits be<br/>donated and provides verification of catastrophic injury or illness as<br/>required by the District. The District determines that the employee is<br/>unable to work due to his or her catastrophic illness or injury or<br/>catastrophic illness or injury affecting the certificated employee’s family<br/>member.</p>
<p>11.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has exhausted all of his/her paid sick leave.</p>
<p>11.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event two or more eligible certificated employees are entitled to the<br/>benefits of this Catastrophic Leave Program, then the days will be<br/>allocated equally until exhausted.</p>
<p>11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Regulations:</p>
<p>11.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic leave credits shall not be used for illness or disability which<br/>qualifies the participant for Workers’ Compensation benefits.</p>
<p>11.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credits shall not be considered available leave for the purpose of<br/>qualifying for STRS disability.</p>
<p>11.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall maintain on file the Catastrophic Leave Bank of Credits.<br/>Credits donated and distributed shall be donated on District forms.</p>
<p>11.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated leave will be used on an as-needed basis by a random drawing a<br/>that time.</p>

<p>12.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be paid such portion of the salary due them for any<br/>month in which absence occurs as, when added to the temporary disability<br/>indemnity under the California Labor Code, will result in payment to them<br/>of not more than their full salaries.</p>
<p>12.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is receiving a temporary disability indemnity, the unit<br/>member shall be entitled to utilize only so much of his/her sick leave and<br/>vacation leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability<br/>indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her of no more than a full day's<br/>wages or salary.

<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer is the change in teaching assignment from one grade to another or the<br/>movement of a unit member between schools.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voluntary transfer occurs when a unit member requests a transfer which is granted by<br/>the District. A unit member may request a transfer on the &quot;Request for Transfer&quot; form attached<br/>hereto as Appendix &quot;D&quot;. The District shall maintain a file containing &quot;Request for Transfer&quot;<br/>forms until December 31 of each year at which time all forms may be discarded by the District.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary transfer occurs when a unit member is transferred without his or her<br/>consent. The unit member who is involuntarily transferred shall be given the opportunity to<br/>discuss the reasons for the transfer with the Principal and/or Superintendent. A unit member<br/>shall not be involuntarily transferred more than twice within a five year period of time. A school<br/>closure or opening transfer does not constitute a move within the five year period.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of vacancies for classroom teachers for the succeeding school year shall be posted<br/>in the faculty rooms at each school as soon as such vacancies are confirmed.</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall endeavor to notify unit members of their tentative assignments by the<br/>last working day in June and in no event later than August 1.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will review and consider unit member &quot;Request for Transfer&quot; forms when<br/>filling vacant positions based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>13.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The educational needs of the pupils and the program needs of the District.</p>
<p>13.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member's training experience and rationale for the request.</p>
<p>13.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level seniority - years of experience at a specific grade level.</p>
<p>13.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority - first day of paid service.</p>
<p>13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is transferred (or moved from one room to another) between the third<br/>day prior to the first pupil attendance day and the last pupil attendance day, the District shall<br/>provide the unit member with two (2) days of released time, for the purpose of moving, room<br/>preparation and lesson planning.</p>
<p>Should such reassignments occur, those positions would be for one year only, and<br/>any unit member reassigned would automatically have the opportunity to return to their original<br/>grade level for the subsequent school year.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this agreement, a reassignment may occur in grade levels IC-3 due to<br/>unpredictable under/over enrollment and is not viewed as a permanent assignment. Any<br/>subsequent needs for additional sections at any grade level will be posted as specified according<br/>to contract.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIV<br/>EVALUATIONS AND PERSONNEL FILES</p>
<p>14.1 Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>14.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of<br/>performance of each unit member, subject to the following procedural<br/>requirements. No grievance arising under this Article shall challenge the content<br/>of the evaluation. Any grievance shall be limited to a claim that the following<br/>procedures have been violated.</p>
<p>14.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of the performance of each certificated employee shall<br/>be made on a continuing basis as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At least once each school year for probationary personnel.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every other year for personnel with permanent status.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every five years for personnel with permanent status who have been<br/>employed at least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, as defined<br/>in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801, and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as<br/>meeting or exceeding standards, if the evaluator and certificated employee being<br/>evaluated agree. The certificated employee or the evaluator may withdraw<br/>consent at any time.</p>
<p>If a unit member is scheduled to be evaluated, but has been granted a leave of<br/>absence of one (1) semester or longer, such evaluation may take place during that<br/>school year or, upon the mutual consent of the unit member and the District, may<br/>take place during the next school year.</p>
<p>14.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to October 1, the District shall inform each unit member who is scheduled<br/>to be evaluated of the name of the prime evaluator. Prior to October 15, the unit<br/>member and the prime evaluator shall meet to discuss the criteria for evaluation<br/>under Education Code Section 44662. In the event agreement upon the elements<br/>of the evaluation cannot be reached, the matter shall be referred to the<br/>Superintendent or designee for final resolution.</p>

At least one of the two required<br/>observations shall be announced and shall be preceded by a pre-observation<br/>conference. A post observation conference shall be held between the evaluator<br/>and the unit member within ten (10) working days of each observation. If the<br/>evaluator determines that the performance of the unit member during the<br/>observation is unsatisfactory, the District will provide</p>
<p>opportunity for another observation after providing the unit member with<br/>guidelines and suggestions for improvement prior to preparation of the final<br/>written evaluation. (See Appendix E for the Evaluation Form.) Observations<br/>may be made by other evaluators as selected by the District. If the evaluator is a<br/>person who is not a regular employee of the District, the District shall provide the<br/>Association and unit member with the name of the evaluator at least ten (10)<br/>working days prior to any observation using said evaluator.</p>
<p>14.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member may prepare a written response to the evaluation, and said<br/>response shall be attached to the evaluation and placed in the unit member's<br/>personnel file as described in Education Code Section 44663.</p>
<p>14.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final written evaluation of a unit member shall be in writing and a copy shall<br/>be given to the unit member at the time of the final evaluation conference which<br/>shall occur thirty days before the last school day.</p>
<p>14.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall comply with Education Code Section 44664 and provide<br/>recommendations as appropriate in areas of needed improvement. Any<br/>permanent unit member who has received an unsatisfactory evaluation shall be</p>
<p>annually evaluated until the unit member receives a satisfactory evaluation. Any<br/>person receiving an overall unsatisfactory evaluation will not advance on the<br/>salary schedule for that year.</p>
<p>14.2 Personnel Files The official personnel file for each unit member shall be maintained in<br/>the District. All materials placed in a unit member's personnel file must be dated and signed by<br/>the contributor.</p>
<p>14.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may inspect and make one copy of material in his/her personnel<br/>file that may serve as a basis for affecting the status of his/her employment except<br/>materials which:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were obtained prior to employment</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were prepared by identifiable committee members, or</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were obtained in connection with a promotional examination.</p>
<p>Such examination must take place during normal business hours of the District<br/>Office at such times other than when the unit member is required to render<br/>service. Such inspection shall take place under supervision of a designee of the<br/>Superintendent. The unit member may have a representative present during such<br/>inspection of materials in his/her persomiel file.</p>
<p>14.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature, except material excepted above, shall not be<br/>entered or filed unless and until the unit member is given notice and an<br/>opportunity to review and comment thereon. A unit member shall have the</p>
<p>right to attach his/her own comments to any derogatory statement. The review<br/>shall take place during normal business hours, and the unit member shall be<br/>released from duty for this purpose without salary reduction. Such review, except<br/>as otherwise approved by the Principal, shall take place at times when the unit<br/>member is not assigned to instruction or student supervision activities.</p>

<p>17.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may select from other applicants at its discretion if there are not<br/>enough permanent or probationary unit member applicants.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVIII</p>
<p>LAYOFF PROCEDURES</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a legal basis exists to layoff unit members, and if the Superintendent recommends to<br/>the Board of Trustees that unit members should be laid off, the Superintendent shall notify the<br/>Association President prior to meeting with and informing unit members who may be laid off.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide to the Association President a seniority list noting the affected<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority is determined by the unit member’s initial date of paid service by the District.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As between employees who first rendered paid service to the District on the same date,<br/>the ranking of such employees shall be determined by a lottery conducted by the Superintendent<br/>or designee in the presence of the Association unless the District and the Association agree that<br/>the Board of Trustees shall determine the order of termination based upon the needs of the<br/>District for that given year.</p>
<p>18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is laid off from employment shall receive the following benefits:</p>
<p>18.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laid off unit member may use up to two days of District paid leave for the<br/>purpose of participating in verifiable job interviews to secure other employment.<br/>The unit member shall give the District notice at least three days in advance<br/>thereof unless the District waives this requirement.</p>
<p>18.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is laid off shall be entitled to continue enrollment in any<br/>health and welfare plan offered by the District to unit members. The unit member<br/>shall continue to receive, at no cost to the unit member, through September, the<br/>medical and health insurance benefits currently awarded to full-time certificated<br/>employees. Thereafter, the unit member may continue to pay for said coverage<br/>under COBRA, provided they are eligible per the insurance earner.</p>
<p>18.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laid off unit member will be offered re-employment as required by law.</p>
<p>18.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Superintendent or designee may meet with unit members to be laid off<br/>and discuss the execution by them of a “layoff agreement” in lieu of completing the<br/>formal layoff process and layoff hearings, provided the District Superintendent gives a<br/>copy of the proposed layoff agreement to the Association President prior to meeting with<br/>any unit member. Upon request of the employee, an Association representative may be<br/>present during such meetings.</p>
<p>18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this article shall not limit the rights of unit members to re-employment<br/>as provided by law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIX</p>
<p>RETIREMENT</p>
<p>19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the approval of the insurance carrier(s), a retired unit member is eligible to</p>
<p>continue individual coverage by the District’s medical, dental and/or vision insurance carrier(s)<br/>for a period of up to five (5) years, but not to continue past age 65. Said coverage will be paid<br/>for by the District, is subject to the then existing rules and regulations of such carrier(s), and is<br/>subject to the approval of such carrier(s). To be eligible for retiree benefits, a unit member must<br/>have provided at least ten (10) years of full-time service within the district. The maximum<br/>annual District payment for such medical, dental and/or vision insurance, per year, is $6,420 per<br/>qualified retired unit member.</p>
<p>19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the approval of the insurance carrier(s), a retired unit member may elect to</p>
<p>continue coverage for their spouse under the District’s medical, dental, and/or vision carrier(s)<br/>for the same period of time that the retired unit member remains covered under such plans. Said<br/>coverage will be paid for by the retired unit member, is subject to the then existing rules and<br/>regulations of such carrier(s), and is subject to the approval of such carrier(s).</p>
<p>19.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members who have retired from employment with the District and have</p>
<p>elected to continue coverage, (for themselves or their spouse), by the District's medical,<br/>dental and/or vision insurance may continue such coverage provided that the retired unit<br/>member pays, in advance to the District, all premiums due for such insurance. If the unit<br/>member fails to make timely payments to the District on any two occasions within any<br/>twenty-four (24) months then such insurance may be terminated at the option of the District<br/>upon thirty (30) days notice to the unit member. Such continued insurance coverage shall be<br/>provided only upon the approval of the insurance broker or carrier, and only in accordance<br/>with the rules and regulations of said insurance broker or earner. In the event the District<br/>obtains insurance for unit members through another insurance carrier or broker, then the<br/>retired unit member may or may not be able to continue such insurance coverage depending<br/>upon the rules and regulations of the new insurance carrier or broker. Neither the District<br/>nor the Association is under any obligation to continue to obtain insurance from the same<br/>broker or earner. The broker or carrier may be changed, at any time, without the approval of<br/>the retired unit members even if the new broker or carrier will not provide such coverage to<br/>the retired unit member. In the event such change results in the new broker or carrier not<br/>providing such coverage to the retired unit member, then such insurance coverage for the<br/>retired unit member shall terminate, and it shall not be the obligation of the Association or<br/>the District to provide continued insurance coverage to the retired unit member.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XX</p>
<p>SAVINGS</p>
<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement is held to be contrary to law by a court of competent<br/>jurisdiction or by an enactment of law by the State, such provision shall not be deemed valid and<br/>subsisting except to the extent permitted by law, but all other provisions shall continue and will<br/>be applied in full force and effect.</p>
<p>20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any rule, regulation, statute or law, enacted or adopted by the Federal or<br/>State legislature or any final decision of the Public Employment Relations Board or final<br/>decision of a court affects, modifies, declares invalid, adds to or subtracts from the provisions of<br/>this Agreement, the parties shall meet and negotiate the affect and impact thereof.</p>

<p>Addendum I</p><h6>Article XII 12.3<br/>Education Code</h6>
<p>Leave of absence</p>
<p>EC 44977</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year, when a person employed in a position requiring certification qualifications<br/>has exhausted all available sick leave, including all accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent<br/>from his or her duties on account of illness or accident for an additional period of five school months,<br/>whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the employment of the employee, the amount<br/>deducted from the salary due him or her for any of the additional five months in which the absence occurs<br/>shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a substitute employee employed to fill his or her position<br/>during his or her absence or, if no substitute employee was employed, the amount that would have been<br/>paid to the substitute had he or she been employed. The school district shall make every reasonable effort<br/>to secure the servi ces of a substitute employee.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For puiposes of subdivision (a):</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month period shall run consecutively.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be provided more than one five-month period per illness or accident.</p>
<p>However, if a school year terminates before the five-month period is exhausted, the employee may take<br/>the balance of the five-month period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The governing board of every school district shall adopt a salary schedule for substitute employees.<br/>The salary schedule shall indicate a salary for a substitute for all categories or classes of certificated<br/>employees of the district.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excepting in a district the governing board of which has adopted a salary schedule for substitute<br/>employees of the district, the amount paid the substitute employee during any month shall be less than the<br/>salary due the employee absent from his or her duties.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person employed in a position requiring certification qualifications is absent from his or her<br/>duties on account of illness for a period of more than five school months, or when a person is absent from<br/>his or her duties for a cause other than illness, the amount deducted from the salary due him or her for the<br/>month in which the absence occurs shall be determined according to the rules and regulations established<br/>by the governing board of the district. The rules and regulations shall not conflict with rules and<br/>regulations of the State Board of Education.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to deprive any district, city, or city and county of the<br/>right to make any reasonable rule for the regulation of accident or sick leave or cumulative accident or<br/>sick leave without loss of salary for persons acquiring certification qualifications.</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section shall be applicable whether or not the absence from duty is by reason of a leave of<br/>absence granted by the governing board of the employing district.</p>
