<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages</p>
<p>It is the intention of the District and the Association to protect the fiscal condition of the District and the continued<br/>employment of the Association members in the case of revenue fluctuations due to the State Budget.</p>
<p>2013-14</p>
<p>6.1.1</p>
<p>The 2012-13 Third Interim Budget documents an estimated projected twelve percent (12%), or $3.75M, ongoing<br/>deficit that must be addressed in the 2013-14 school year and beyond. In order to address the identified<br/>ongoing deficit, the District and Association agree to the following solutions:</p>
<p>6.1.2</p>
<p>The District and Association agree to apply any funded, unrestricted Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)-LCFF<br/>adjustments and the Mandate Block Grant funds approved and adopted in the 2013-14 Final State Budget, and with<br/>legal spending authority provided to the District for operational unrestricted General Fund expenses, proportionally<br/>to the ongoing budget deficit attributable to the Brea Olinda Teachers' Association (BOTA) as identified in budget<br/>exhibits presented in negotiations (62.97%). Based on current information presented in the Governor's May Revision<br/>budget, the District estimates that BOTA's pro rata share of the ongoing deficit will decrease from approximately<br/>$2.361M to 1.523M as a result of applying BOTA's proportionate share of any Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)-LCFF<br/>adjustments and the Mandate Block Grant funds approved and adopted in the 2013-14 Final State Budget, and with<br/>legal spending authority provided to the District.</p>
<p>6.1.3</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that for every $102,170 shortfall of BOTA's proportionate share of the<br/>deficit, BOTA and the District agree to schedule one (1) furlough day up to a maximum often (10) days. This<br/>reduction in the annual contract salary computation will be evenly distributed through the 2013-14 monthly pay<br/>periods. The base pay of BOTA members who work less than a full year and part-time BOTA members shall be<br/>reduced in an equal percentage with full-time BOTA members. The calendar committee will meet at a mutually<br/>acceptable date after the State has adopted its 2013-14 budget in order to calendar necessary furlough days, per<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.2</p>
<p>The first priority for restoration of a furlough day will be the day before school starts which will be a full work day<br/>(non-furlough day) for all BOTA members. Half of the teacher work day (3.5 hours) before the first day of school will<br/>be committed to teacher preparation, and half the work day (3.5 hours) will be committed to staff meetings/staff<br/>development.</p>
<p>6.3</p>
<p>Should the furlough days proposed above not be sufficient to address BOTA's proportionate share of the 2013-14<br/>ongoing deficit, the District and BOTA agree that the following adjustments will be made: (1) delay of step increases<br/>for 9 months and (2) delay of column adjustments for 2013-14.</p>
<p>6.4</p>
<p>Should sale proceeds from the Lilac Lane Olinda property be available, and the District receives a State<br/>waiver/approval prior to June 30, 2014, the District and the Association agree to use a portion of the proceeds to</p>

<p>July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2015</p>
<p>restore up to 50% of BOTA's proportionate share of the shortfall, which may include restoration of the adjustments<br/>set forth in Section 6.3 above retroactive to the beginning of the 2013-14 fiscal year and up to three (3) furlough<br/>days which have not been taken.</p>
<p>6.5</p>
<p>Should there be additional unrestricted General Fund State revenue actually received by the District with<br/>unrestricted spending authority provided in the final adopted State budget over that contained in the Governor's<br/>May Revision, the parties agree that this will be used to eliminate or reduce the number of furlough days set forth<br/>in Section 6.1.3 above. The order of restoration of furlough days shall result in an equal distribution of student<br/>attendance days and student-free teacher work days.</p>
<p>6.6</p>
<p>Should the State funding for Common Core implementation be actually received in the 2013-14 school year, District<br/>agrees to provide one (1) Staff Development Day, if allowable per regulations.</p>
<p>6.7</p>
<p>If there are any modifications to current STRS contribution levels for the District and/or employees represented by<br/>the Association, the parties agree to reopen negotiations within ten (10) school days.</p>
<p>6.8</p>
<p>To insure that there will be no negative impact to revenue available for compensation, the District and BOTA agree<br/>that K-3 class sizes will not exceed the school-wide K-3 averages in 2012-13, and the District will work toward LCFF<br/>K-3 Class Size Reduction targets each year so long as it produces no negative impact (encroachment) to the<br/>unrestricted General Fund.</p>
<p>6.9</p>
<p>Health benefits include medical, dental, vision, and life insurance, The District and employee will each contribute<br/>half of any health benefits premium increase, which will not exceed ten percent (10%). The District and employee<br/>will share equally in any health benefits premium decrease as well. The District's and Association's representatives<br/>to the health benefits trust (MEBA) will with other MEBA representatives work to hold health benefits premium<br/>increases to not more than ten percent even if the health benefits must be adjusted to maintain the ten percent<br/>ceiling. Each year's health benefits premium will be the basis for calculating the ten percent ceiling for the ensuing<br/>year. Unless otherwise determined by the health benefits trust (MEBA), medical, vision, and life insurance will be<br/>provided District employees through MEBA and dental benefits will be provided by the Keenan JPA or MEBA if<br/>available.</p>
<p>6.9.1</p>
<p>The employee contributions for full time active employees to the medical and dental plans provided through MEBA<br/>will be adjusted as noted in Appendix D. The effective date of these new contribution levels will be determined after<br/>ratification of this Agreement, but will be implemented no sooner than after the first full month following<br/>ratification.</p>
<p>2014-15</p>
<p>6.10</p>
<p>The salary schedule shall be restored to eliminate ail furlough days, and return to a 185 work days schedule. The<br/>salary schedule for 2014-15 is set forth on Appendix A2. All employees represented by the Association who are<br/>eligible for step and column advancement shall be advanced.</p>

<p>Should sale proceeds from the Lilac Lane Olinda property be available prior to June 30,2015, District and Association<br/>agree that Association shall receive its proportionate share of the sale proceeds as set forth in the waiver approved<br/>by the State on January 22, 2014, subject to negotiations on how the money will be distributed. It is understood<br/>that this is equivalent to a one-time four percent (4%) off the salary schedule attached as Appendix 2.</p>

<p>Health Benefits include medical, dental, vision and life insurance. The District and the employee will each contribute<br/>half of any health benefits program increase, which will not exceed ten percent (10%). The District and the employee<br/>will share equally in any health benefits premium decrease as well. The District and Association, coordinating with<br/>CSEA Chapter #207, work to hold health benefits premium increases to not more than ten percent (10%) even if the<br/>health benefits must be adjusted to maintain the ten percent (10%) ceiling. Each year's health benefits premium<br/>will be the basis for calculating the ten percent (10%) ceiling for the ensuing year.

<p>Teachers, who obtain prior approval to use their private vehicles for carrying out their normal assignments or for<br/>conducting school business, shall be paid at the District approved rate established for mileage reimbursements, on<br/>submission of a claim. Teachers, who must travel on a regular basis throughout the District, may be compensated<br/>by a set amount on a monthly basis. The amount to be paid shall be based on an average of the miles traveled per<br/>month. All personnel, who are to receive regular monthly payments, shall be approved by name and by amount by<br/>the Board of Education on the recommendation of the administration.</p>
<p>6.17</p>

<p>Full-time unit members shall be entitled to one (1) day leave per month of employment, excluding summer school,<br/>with full pay for each school year for purposes of personal illness or injury. Teachers who work less than full-time<br/>shall be entitled to that portion of the ten (10) day's leave as the number of hours per week of scheduled duty relates<br/>to the number of hours for a full-time teacher in a comparable position.</p>
<p>9.2.2</p>
<p>After all earned leave as set forth in 9.2.1 above, and all accumulated sick leave as described in 9.2.3 below is<br/>exhausted, additional non-accumulated leave shall be available beginning on the tenth (10th) day of absence due to<br/>illness or injury for a period not to exceed five (5) school months, provided that the provisions below are met. The<br/>amount deducted for leave purposes from the teacher's salary shall be the lesser of: the amount actually paid a<br/>substitute employee employed to fill the position during the leave, or if no substitute is employed, the amount which<br/>would have been paid to a substitute or fifty percent (50%) of the absent teacher's daily salary.</p>
<p>9.2.3</p>
<p>If a teacher does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in 9.2.1 above in any school year, the amount not<br/>utilized shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>9.2.4</p>
<p>Upon request by District management, a teacher shall be required to present a medical doctor's certificate verifying<br/>the personal illness or injury and/or a medical authorization to return to work. The District may require, at its<br/>expense, a certified medical physician to visit the teacher and make all necessary inquiries in order to be fully<br/>informed as to the nature and severity of the illness or injury, and to report such findings to the Superintendent (or<br/>designee). Should such differ in its conclusion from that of the teacher's physician, a mutually acceptable third<br/>physician may be sought for a concurring opinion at the teacher's expense.</p>
<p>9.2.4.1</p>
<p>If the report concludes that the absence is not due to personal illness or injury, or that the illness is not sufficiently<br/>severe to warrant continued absence, then the Superintendent (or designee), after notice to the teacher, may refuse<br/>to grant such leave.</p>
<p>9.2.5</p>
<p>Whenever possible, a teacher must contact his/her immediate supervisor as soon as the need to be absent is known,<br/>preferably not less than two (2) hours prior to the start of the workday, to permit the employer time to secure<br/>substitute service. Failure to provide adequate notice without good reason shall be grounds for denial of leave with<br/>pay.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>9.2.6</p>
<p>A teacher, who is absent, shall have deducted prorata amount of accumulated leave.</p>

<p>9.3 Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>9.3.1</p>
<p>Leave, which is credited under Personal Illness and Injury Leave above, may be used for purposes of personal<br/>necessity provided that use of such personal necessity does not exceed ten (10) days in any school year.</p>

<p>10.4</p>
<p>To ensure that there will be no negative impact to revenue available for compensation, the District will not exceed<br/>the school-wide averages set forth below for 2014.15.
