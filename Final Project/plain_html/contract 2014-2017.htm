Following this time period, if the<br/>bargaining unit member still desires to be returned to the position, a written<br/>request may be presented, and consideration will be given to the bargaining unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who is being involuntarily transferred because of<br/>changes in enrollment or program change shall be entitled to request and receive<br/>assignment to any open position for which he/she is qualified. If more than one<br/>bargaining unit member so displaced requests the same position, the bargaining<br/>unit member with the greatest seniority shall be granted placement in the position.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who has been involuntarily transferred shall not be<br/>involuntarily transferred again the following year.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall follow procedures outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section D<br/>before employing bargaining unit members from outside of the unit. Such<br/>employment shall not result in the layoff of any bargaining unit member in the<br/>unit.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Reassignment</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member desiring a reassignment for the following<br/>school year shall notify his/her principal in writing prior to April 1.

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary reassignments within the school site staff shall be considered<br/>first before accepting transfers.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other qualifications, as listed in C.5.a located above, being substantially</p>
<p>equal, the bargaining unit member with the greatest seniority shall be<br/>given priority in filling the vacancy.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the request for the reassignment occurs within the regular school year, the</p>
<p>bargaining unit member and the principal may write an agreement that<br/>would allow the bargaining unit member to assume the new position at the<br/>beginning of the following year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Reassignment</p>

<p>involuntarily reassign a bargaining unit member desiring to remain at that<br/>site.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>c. When determining who to reassign the principal will consider among other<br/>factors whether that person has been involuntarily reassigned in recent<br/>years.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination Class Assignments (Elementary Sites). Notwithstanding any other<br/>provision of this Agreement to the contrary. Combination Classes shall be treated as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members assigned to a single-grade level class may be<br/>reassigned to a combination class provided the combination class<br/>assignment includes the same grade level currently being taught by the<br/>member.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When determining a reassignment to a combination class, the principal<br/>shall consider the following factors:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary reassignments from the affected grade levels shall be<br/>considered first.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment to a combination class shall be rotated between all<br/>members who are currently assigned to the affected grade levels.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless a bargaining unit member volunteers to remain in a<br/>combination class, the unit member shall be reassigned from the<br/>combination class to a single-grade class within the affected grade<br/>levels after one year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining member is reassigned from a combination class in<br/>accordance with b (3) above, a bargaining unit member in a single-grade<br/>assignment in the affected grade levels will be reassigned to the<br/>combination class unless another bargaining unit member volunteers for<br/>the combination class.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Teachers on Special Assignment” (TOSA1 Returning to the Classroom</p>
<p>A TOSA is considered on leave from their regular position; therefore, when the leave<br/>ends, the.bargaining unit member shall be returned to a teaching position at their current<br/>or original site, if open. A TOSA who is returning to a teaching assignment that is not<br/>able to remain at their current site or is not able to return to their original site due to no<br/>open position shall select, in order of district seniority, from open positions for which they<br/>are qualified. Such placement shall be made consistent with the applicable provisions of<br/>Section C. and D. above.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. It is understood and agreed by the parties that the primary objective of the evaluation</p>
<p>process is to improve the quality of instruction. For the purpose of this article. Librarian,<br/>Counselor, Non-teaching Resource Bargaining unit member, and Teacher on Special<br/>Assignment will be referred to as non classroom bargaining unit members and be<br/>evaluated on Forms IB, 2B, and 3B. A bargaining unit member shall be evaluated by<br/>one &quot;Evaluator&quot; who shall be his/her principal or designee, except:</p>
<p>1. Teachers on Special Assignment and elementary itinerant bargaining unit</p>
<p>members. These bargaining unit members shall be evaluated by the respective<br/>supervisor or their designee.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation of bargaining unit members shall utilize the forms and guidelines as set forth<br/>in the documents which are appended to this Agreement as Appendix B and is hereby<br/>made a part thereof.</p>
<p>1. Evaluation procedures for bargaining unit members shall consist of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall evaluate every probationary bargaining unit member<br/>(every year) by at least one (1) Walk-Through Feedback (Form 1 A) and<br/>one (1) Certificated Lesson Observation (Form 2A) in each of the<br/>following periods:</p>

The observations may begin<br/>three (3) weeks after the start of the school year and end forty-five (45)<br/>calendar days prior to the last day scheduled on the school calendar.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent employee and their evaluator may voluntarily agree to a<br/>three year evaluation cycle in writing if the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>(1) The employee has been employed for at least 10 years with the<br/>District; (2) the employee is “highly qualified” as defined by the federal<br/>NCLB Act of 2001; if they occupy a position required to be filled by a<br/>highly qualified professional by the federal law; and (3) the employee’s<br/>previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards.</p>
<p>Because this is voluntary, the permanent employee or the evaluator may<br/>withdraw their consent to the three year cycle at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>If consent to the three-year cycle is voluntarily withdrawn by either the<br/>evaluator or the permanent employee, the permanent employee’s<br/>evaluation shall be conducted within the same school year as long as the<br/>evaluator complies with the timeline specified in B (1) b. above. If the</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>evaluation cannot be timely completed in that school year, the permanent<br/>employee shall be evaluated in the following school year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Walk-Through Feedback (Form 1 A) shall require no prior notification<br/>to the bargaining unit member, and the duration is generally less than that<br/>of a full lesson.</p>

<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member receives a &quot;Needs to Improve to Meet<br/>District Expectations&quot; rating on the evaluation form he/she shall be<br/>entitled to request subsequent observations and conferences. However, in<br/>the event the bargaining unit member so rated does not make any such<br/>request, the evaluator shall have the right to make further observations of,<br/>and conduct further conferences with, such bargaining unit member on<br/>his/her own initiative. The evaluator shall have the right to reasonable use<br/>of the expertise of other District administrative personnel in an effort to<br/>improve instruction. Summary statements from the assisting<br/>administrator(s) may be referred to by the evaluator in his/her evaluation<br/>of the bargaining unit member and may be placed in the bargaining unit<br/>member's file if procedures outlined in F. 1 of this Article are followed.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member receives an evaluation report where a<br/>&quot;Needs to Improve to Meet District Expectations&quot; box has been checked<br/>the evaluator shall annually evaluate the bargaining unit member, using<br/>the designated forms, until the bargaining unit member achieves a positive<br/>evaluation or is separated from District service.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the evaluator determines that the &quot;Needs to Improve to Meet<br/>District Expectations&quot; rating can be changed to &quot;Meets and/or Exceeds<br/>District Expectations&quot;, he/she shall send a written notification using Form<br/>4 to the Personnel Office to be attached to the evaluation form stating that<br/>the bargaining unit member's performance now &quot;Meets and/or Exceeds<br/>District Expectations&quot;, with one copy kept on file in the evaluator's office<br/>and one copy given to the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>2. Unless a “Strategy for Assistance&quot; (Form 4) is completed, the number of</p>
<p>observations for written evaluation using appropriate forms shall not exceed four<br/>(4) per year per permanent bargaining unit member, except as otherwise requested<br/>by the bargaining unit member.</p>

<p>The employee has been employed for at least 10 years with the district,<br/>and the employee is highly qualified, if they occupy a position required to<br/>be filled by a highly qualified professional by the federal law, and the<br/>employee’s previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or<br/>exceeding standards.</p>
<p>Because this is voluntary, the permanent employee or the evaluator may<br/>withdraw their consent to the three year cycle at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>If consent to the three-year cycle is voluntarily withdrawn, by either the<br/>evaluator or the permanent employee, the permanent employee’s<br/>evaluation shall be conducted within the same school year as long as the<br/>evaluator complies with the timeline specified in B (1) b. above.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the written evaluation, the evaluator will include substantiated evidence and/or<br/>information collected through direct observation.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative evaluation of performance shall be predicated upon information or material<br/>of a derogatory or critical nature which has been received by the evaluator from others<br/>(such as parents and citizens) or is developed by the evaluator or other administrator<br/>unless the following procedures have been followed.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to such materials in the bargaining unit member's personnel records,<br/>the bargaining unit member shall first be given written and oral notice and an<br/>opportunity to review and comment, including the right to enter into the records<br/>his/her own written comments.

<p>43</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the appropriate administrator to timely respond at Levels I or<br/>Level II of the grievance procedure shall result in the grievance being<br/>automatically forwarded to the next level.</p>

Discipline under this article shall be limited to include warnings,<br/>reprimands, or suspensions without pay up to fifteen (15) working days. Discipline shall<br/>not include dismissal or suspensions for more than fifteen (15) working days and shall<br/>not be arbitrary and capricious. A bargaining unit member is entitled to representation by<br/>the Association in the application of this article.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive Discipline</p>
<p>The District is limited to the following progressive disciplinary procedures, except for<br/>conduct, which is of such a nature that injures or threatens to injure the safety of pupils or<br/>other employees or causes substantial disruption to the educational program whereby<br/>steps may be skipped based on the seriousness of the employee’s conduct.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal Counseling/Warning</p>
<p>The district shall first verbally counsel/wam before imposing further discipline.<br/>Verbal counseling/warning may result in a post-conference summary<br/>memorandum. Post-conference summary memorandum will not be placed in the<br/>unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Warning</p>
<p>Subject to B1 above, written warnings will not be used unless the unit member<br/>has been verbally warned about similar actions within the last twelve (12) months.<br/>Written warnings will not be placed in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Reprimand</p>
<p>Reprimands shall be administered within ten (10) working days of the questioned<br/>infraction. Subject to B1 and B2 above, written reprimands will not be used<br/>unless the unit member has received a written warning about similar actions<br/>within the last twelve (12) months. The unit member will sign the reprimand to<br/>acknowledge receipt. Two (2) years from its effective date, a written reprimand<br/>in the unit member’s personnel file shall be permanently removed upon request.<br/>A statement verifying the permanent removal of the reprimand shall be provided<br/>to the unit member.</p>
<p>a. At the discretion of the grievant, a written reprimand may be appealed<br/>commencing at level II as outlined in Article 14 D.2.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to Bl, B2, B3 above, suspension will not be used unless the unit<br/>member has received a written reprimand about similar actions within the<br/>last twelve (12) months. No unit member will be suspended more than<br/>fifteen (15) working days during a school year. In all instances, however,<br/>the length of a suspension will relate to the severity of the action.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to administering any formal discipline subsequent to the verbal and<br/>written reprimands, a unit member shall be provided notice in accordance<br/>with B6 within ten (10) working days after an infraction following the</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>written reprimand provided the infraction occurred within twelve (12)<br/>months of the written reprimand. The unit member will be afforded the<br/>opportunity to meet with the Superintendent/Designee. The unit member<br/>shall be given ten (10) working days within which to reply in writing. The<br/>proposed formal discipline shall not be imposed until after the unit<br/>member’s written reply has been received and given serious consideration<br/>by the Superintendent/Designee.</p>
<p>c. Any initial suspension of an employee pending a disciplinary hearing shall<br/>be with pay.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave</p>
<p>In the event a unit member is placed on administrative leave without advance<br/>notice, a notice will be sent to the unit member by certified mail addressed to the<br/>unit member’s last known address, within five (5) days of the unit member’s<br/>removal from the position, with a copy concurrently provided to the Association<br/>president.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed and effective date.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of this Article and Article XIII of the Agreement.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of incidents or misconduct occurring within 12 month period<br/>forming the basis for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only suspension without pay may be appealed to arbitration under the<br/>grievance procedure in Article XIII (Grievance Procedure) of the<br/>Agreement commencing with Level III (Mediation). If timely appealed,<br/>the penalty will not be applied until the arbitrator’s decision is rendered,<br/>except for just cause necessitating the immediate removal of the unit<br/>member from the worksite. At arbitration, the just cause for earlier<br/>discipline, may be determined by the arbitrator. An arbitrator may award<br/>back pay.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association must request mediation by delivering written notice of<br/>appeal to the Superintendent within twenty (20) working days after receipt<br/>of the notice of suspension. If the Association does not request mediation</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>within the above timeline, the suspension without pay may be imposed<br/>immediately by the Superintendent or designee.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XX<br/>ARCHIVE ARTICLES</p>
<p>Documents in this section are archived when programs are phased out but retain the potential of<br/>being re-instated. Documents entered into this section have been taken in their entirety from the<br/>body of the contract in the contract year of the Archive decision.</p>
<p>When the situation for which the article was originally negotiated re-surfaces, the archived<br/>article shall be re-activated. The District and the Association agree that the entirety of the<br/>Article section shall be re-inserted into the original area of the contract. It shall be through<br/>mutual agreement between the District and the Association before the re-activated article<br/>receives any modification or changes to language.</p>
<p>Article Seven - Year Round Schools</p>
<p>Originally language was negotiated in 1985, to meet the needs of calendar changes and proposals<br/>in relation to attendance tracks and track changes. The State of California provided financial<br/>incentives for districts to engage in Year-Round School planning which was eventually phased<br/>out. An additional goal of the Year-Round School concept was that of utilizing school facilities<br/>in the most cost-effective manner. This Article was Archived in 2004 when the District<br/>committed to maintaining a single track schedule at all District schools.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, within two (2) school years following an involuntary transfer because of<br/>enrollment, employee certification or program changes, the original position re¬<br/>opens, the transferred bargaining unit member may request in writing and shall be<br/>granted the return to that position, if qualified. Following this time period, if the<br/>bargaining unit member still desires to be returned to the position, a written<br/>request may be presented, and consideration will be given to the bargaining unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who is being involuntarily transferred because of<br/>changes in enrollment or program change shall be entitled to request and receive<br/>assignment to any open position for which he/she is qualified.

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Reassignment</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member desiring a reassignment for the following<br/>school year shall notify his/her principal in writing prior to April 1.

<p>equal, the bargaining unit member with the greatest seniority shall be<br/>given priority in filling the vacancy.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the request for the reassignment occurs within the regular school year, the</p>
<p>bargaining unit member and the principal may write an agreement that<br/>would allow the bargaining unit member to assume the new position at the<br/>beginning of the following year.</p>

<p>20</p>
<p>c. When determining who to reassign the principal will consider among other<br/>factors whether that person has been involuntarily reassigned in recent<br/>years.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. It is understood and agreed by the parties that the primary objective of the evaluation</p>
<p>process is to improve the quality of instruction. For the purpose of this article, Librarian,<br/>Counselor, Non-teaching Resource Bargaining unit member, and Teacher on Special<br/>Assignment will be referred to as non classroom bargaining unit members and be<br/>evaluated on Forms IB, 2B, and 3B. A bargaining unit member shall be evaluated by<br/>one &quot;Evaluator&quot; who shall be his/her principal or designee, except:</p>
<p>1. Teachers on Special Assignment and elementary itinerant bargaining unit</p>
<p>members. These bargaining unit members shall be evaluated by the respective<br/>supervisor or their designee.</p>
<p>B. Evaluation of bargaining unit members shall utilize the forms and guidelines as set forth<br/>in the documents which are appended to this Agreement as Appendix B and is hereby<br/>made a part thereof.</p>
<p>1. Evaluation procedures for bargaining unit members shall consist of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall evaluate every probationary bargaining unit member<br/>(every year) by at least one (1) Walk-Through Feedback (Form 1A) and<br/>one (1) Certificated Lesson Observation (Form 2 A) in each of the<br/>following periods:</p>
<p>September 15 - December 1, December 2 - March 1, using designated<br/>forms.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall evaluate every permanent bargaining unit member at<br/>least every other year by at least one (1) Walk-Through Feedback (Form<br/>1 A) and one (1) Certificated Lesson Observation (Form 2A) during that<br/>year unless the permanent bargaining unit member and evaluator<br/>voluntarily agree to extend the evaluation cycle in writing per the<br/>limitations set forth in paragraph c below. The observations may begin<br/>three (3) weeks after the start of the school year and end forty-five (45)<br/>calendar days prior to the last day scheduled on the school calendar.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent employee and their evaluator may voluntarily agree to a<br/>three year evaluation cycle in writing if the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>(1) The employee has been employed for at least 10 years with the<br/>District; (2) the employee is “highly qualified” as defined by the federal<br/>NCLB Act of 2001; if they occupy a position required to be filled by a<br/>highly qualified professional by the federal law; and (3) the employee’s<br/>previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards.</p>
<p>Because this is voluntary, the permanent employee or the evaluator may<br/>withdraw their consent to the three year cycle at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>If consent to the three-year cycle is voluntarily withdrawn by either the<br/>evaluator or the permanent employee, the permanent employee’s<br/>evaluation shall be conducted within the same school year as long as the<br/>evaluator complies with the timeline specified in B (1) b. above. If the</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>evaluation cannot be timely completed in that school year, the permanent<br/>employee shall be evaluated in the following school year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Walk-Through Feedback (Form 1 A) shall require no prior notification<br/>to the bargaining unit member, and the duration is generally less than that<br/>of a full lesson.</p>
<p>(2) A Certificated Lesson Observation (Form 2A) shall consist of an<br/>observation of a full lesson and a post observation conference.</p>
<p>Notification of the observation shall be given at least two days prior to the<br/>lesson observation and may include a pre-observation conference.</p>

<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member receives a &quot;Needs to Improve to Meet<br/>District Expectations&quot; rating on the evaluation form he/she shall be<br/>entitled to request subsequent observations and conferences. However, in<br/>the event the bargaining unit member so rated does not make any such<br/>request, the evaluator shall have the right to make further observations of,<br/>and conduct further conferences with, such bargaining unit member on<br/>his/her own initiative. The evaluator shall have the right to reasonable use<br/>of the expertise of other District administrative personnel in an effort to<br/>improve instruction. Summary statements from the assisting<br/>administrator(s) may be referred to by the evaluator in his/her evaluation<br/>of the bargaining unit member and may be placed in the bargaining unit<br/>member's file if procedures outlined in F. 1 of this Article are followed.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member receives an evaluation report where a<br/>&quot;Needs to Improve to Meet District Expectations&quot; box has been checked<br/>the evaluator shall annually evaluate the bargaining unit member, using<br/>the designated forms, until the bargaining unit member achieves a positive<br/>evaluation or is separated from District service.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the evaluator determines that the &quot;Needs to Improve to Meet<br/>District Expectations&quot; rating can be changed to &quot;Meets and/or Exceeds<br/>District Expectations&quot;, he/she shall send a written notification using Form<br/>4 to the Personnel Office to be attached to the evaluation form stating that<br/>the bargaining unit member's performance now &quot;Meets and/or Exceeds<br/>District Expectations&quot;, with one copy kept on file in the evaluator's office<br/>and one copy given to the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>2. Unless a “Strategy for Assistance&quot; (Form 4) is completed, the number of</p>
<p>observations for written evaluation using appropriate forms shall not exceed four<br/>(4) per year per permanent bargaining unit member, except as otherwise requested<br/>by the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>C. Evaluation of bargaining unit members shall utilize the forms and guidelines as set forth<br/>in the documents which are appended to this Agreement as Appendix B and is hereby<br/>made a part thereof.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall evaluate every permanent bargaining unit member at<br/>least every other year by at least one (1) Preliminary Evaluation Feedback<br/>(Form IB) and one (1) Preliminary Evaluation Feedback (Form 2B) unless<br/>the permanent bargaining unit member and evaluator voluntarily agree to<br/>extend the evaluation cycle in writing per the limitations set forth in<br/>paragraph c below. The observations may begin three (3) weeks after the<br/>start of the school year and end forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the<br/>last day scheduled on the school calendar.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent employee and their evaluator may voluntarily agree to a<br/>three year evaluation cycle in writing if the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>The employee has been employed for at least 10 years with the district,<br/>and the employee is highly qualified, if they occupy a position required to<br/>be filled by a highly qualified professional by the federal law, and the<br/>employee’s previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or<br/>exceeding standards.</p>
<p>Because this is voluntary, the permanent employee or the evaluator may<br/>withdraw their consent to the three year cycle at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>If consent to the three-year cycle is voluntarily withdrawn, by either the<br/>evaluator or the permanent employee, the permanent employee’s<br/>evaluation shall be conducted within the same school year as long as the<br/>evaluator complies with the timeline specified in B (1) b. above.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Preliminary Evaluation Feedback (Form IB) shall require no prior<br/>notification to the bargaining unit member, and the duration is generally<br/>less than that of a full activity.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the written evaluation, the evaluator will include substantiated evidence and/or<br/>information collected through direct observation.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative evaluation of performance shall be predicated upon information or material<br/>of a derogatory or critical nature which has been received by the evaluator from others<br/>(such as parents and citizens) or is developed by the evaluator or other administrator<br/>unless the following procedures have been followed.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to such materials in the bargaining unit member's personnel records,<br/>the bargaining unit member shall first be given written and oral notice and an<br/>opportunity to review and comment, including the right to enter into the records<br/>his/her own written comments. Such review shall take place during normal<br/>business hours, and bargaining unit members shall be released from duty for this<br/>purpose without salary reduction.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to parent or citizen complaints, the bargaining unit member shall first<br/>be given written and oral notice of same and an opportunity to discuss and attempt<br/>to resolve the matter with the complaining party, together with the appropriate<br/>administrator.</p>

<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members shall have the right to recommend to the principal, via a written<br/>request, that an aide be transferred. Such reasons may include persistent disagreement<br/>regarding classroom methods, unsuitability of aides' skills or particular differences<br/>regarding standards of student behavior.</p>
<p>A bargaining unit member's evaluation shall not be adversely affected due to a delay in<br/>material ordered and not received which is needed to implement a new District program.</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class Sizes K-3:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 2013-14 school year, the District and the Association agree<br/>to a collectively bargained alternative class size ratio to implement the Local<br/>Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”) Class Size Reduction (“CSR”) program.<br/>Accordingly, school site average class enrollments in Kindergarten (including<br/>Transitional Kindergarten) and grades 1-3, inclusive, shall not exceed a student-<br/>teacher ratio of 32:1.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that this negotiated school site average class enrollment limit<br/>meets all requirements of law and fulfills the LCFF collective bargaining exception<br/>requirements to obtain CSR grade span adjustment funding.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If State regulations are modified in a manner that causes the District to incur a CSR<br/>penalty or to lose CSR funds, then the parties agree to immediately meet and<br/>renegotiate this provision to avoid that financial loss.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to negotiate this provision for the 2015-16 school year without<br/>either party’s need to use a “reopener.”</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance provided by the consulting bargaining unit member shall focus on no<br/>more than two (2) specific areas recommended for improvement on the<br/>participating bargaining unit member's evaluation</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance activities shall be intense and multifaceted, and shall be preceded by a<br/>conference when the bargaining unit member receives the &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;<br/>evaluation or as soon as practicable (i e. upon appointment of consulting teacher).<br/>The conference shall involve the bargaining unit member being referred, the<br/>evaluator, and the consulting bargaining unit member to begin the development of<br/>an assistance plan. If the permanent bargaining unit member so desires, the<br/>Association shall provide representation in this meeting.</p>
<p>5 The assistance shall be provided by consulting bargaining unit members under<br/>this Article and shall be closely monitored by the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>6. The parties understand that every possible subject matter competency may not be<br/>available within the corps of consulting bargaining unit members. Therefore, it<br/>shall occasionally be necessary to secure additional assistance to fully address<br/>identified deficiencies. In such cases, the consulting bargaining unit member<br/>shall maintain primary responsibility for the assistance plan, but may function<br/>more like a facilitator who assures the availability of appropriate resources.</p>
<p>7 The course of assistance shall include one or more of the following:</p>
<p>a. Multiple classroom observations by the consulting bargaining unit<br/>member;</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for the bargaining unit member receiving assistance to<br/>observe exemplary practice;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District provided professional development opportunities;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference attendance, possibly in the company of a consulting<br/>bargaining unit member or subject area specialist;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of assistance, including the use of a subject area specialist,<br/>which the consulting bargaining unit member or the panel may deem<br/>appropriate.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication between the consulting bargaining unit member and<br/>principal/evaluator shall be ongoing.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written peer review reports will be submitted to the Panel by the consulting<br/>bargaining unit member every 4 to 6 weeks. The coach will share all written and<br/>verbal reports during the conference with the bargaining unit member prior to<br/>submission to the Panel. A copy of the written reports will be provided to the<br/>principal/evaluator.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this article precludes the principal/evaluator or District from doing<br/>informal observations nor from notifying the bargaining unit member verbally<br/>and/or in writing regarding incidents or events related to the bargaining unit<br/>member's fulfillment of his or her professional obligations.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consulting bargaining unit member shall submit a written final report<br/>regarding the bargaining unit member's participation in PAR to the Panel no later<br/>than April 1. This report shall describe the measures of assistance provided to the<br/>bargaining unit member and describe the consulting bargaining unit member's<br/>observation of the bargaining unit member's implementation of the assistance.<br/>The final report shall become a part of the permanent bargaining unit member's<br/>personnel file. The bargaining unit member shall have the opportunity to attach<br/>his or her comments.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel will have the opportunity to ask the consulting bargaining<br/>unit member for clarification of anything in the final report.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member and principal/evaluator may be present for<br/>the consulting bargaining unit member's report and will be given an<br/>opportunity to respond to the report.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accept the consulting bargaining unit member's report.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue the bargaining unit member in the Program with statement of<br/>reasons that support the conclusion.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send the bargaining unit member's name to the Board of Education with<br/>the recommendation that no further assistance and remediation will be<br/>successful with statement of reasons that support the conclusion.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of assistance shall normally be for one year; however, the<br/>assistance may be extended to a second year if the Panel deems it necessary.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deliberations of the Panel shall be closed and confidential. Panel decisions<br/>shall be based on the information provided by the consulting bargaining unit<br/>member, the principal/evaluator, and the permanent bargaining unit member or<br/>his or her Association representative.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the bargaining unit member, consulting bargaining unit member, nor<br/>principal/evaluator may be present during the confidential deliberations of the<br/>Panel.</p>
<p>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Panel shall be reported to the bargaining unit member, the<br/>principal/evaluator, and the Association representative, if requested by the<br/>bargaining unit member, by Superintendent or designee in a conference.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member shall not have access to the grievance process to<br/>challenge the content of report, or decisions of the Panel, but may file responses<br/>which shall become part of the official record of the intervention.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Program in no manner diminishes the legal rights of bargaining unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Bargaining Unit Member Peer Assistance Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member may volunteer for the peer assistance program. The<br/>PAR Panel will determine whether that bargaining unit member may participate<br/>in the program. All participants referred to the PAR Program based on an<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation will be served prior to accepting any voluntary<br/>participants.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach and the bargaining unit member will meet to determine the volunteer<br/>bargaining unit member's needs and jointly develop an assistance plan. This plan<br/>will draw from the course of assistance that is available through the PAR Program<br/>enumerated in Section D. 7 and include timelines.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Bargaining Unit Members will provide oral feedback and written<br/>documentation to the volunteer bargaining unit member. Communication<br/>between the voluntary participant and his or her consulting bargaining unit<br/>member concerning participation in the Program shall remain confidential.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Documentation will not be placed in the personnel file only so long as the<br/>participation continues to be on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluntary bargaining unit member may terminate his or her participation in<br/>the Program at any time.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consulting bargaining unit member will keep track for the Panel of time spent<br/>with the voluntary participant for accounting purposes for the Panel.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XX<br/>ARCHIVE ARTICLES</p>
<p>Documents in this section are archived when programs are phased out but retain the potential of<br/>being re-instated. Documents entered into this section have been taken in their entirety from the<br/>body of the contract in the contract year of the Archive decision.</p>
<p>When the situation for which the article was originally negotiated re-surfaces, the archived<br/>article shall be re-activated. The District and the Association agree that the entirety of the<br/>Article section shall be re-inserted into the original area of the contract. It shall be through<br/>mutual agreement between the District and the Association before the re-activated article<br/>receives any modification or changes to language.</p>
<p>Article Seven - Year Round Schools</p>
<p>Originally language was negotiated in 1985, to meet the needs of calendar changes and proposals<br/>in relation to attendance tracks and track changes. The State of California provided financial<br/>incentives for districts to engage in Year-Round School planning which was eventually phased<br/>out. An additional goal of the Year-Round School concept was that of utilizing school facilities<br/>in the most cost-effective manner. This Article was Archived in 2004 when the District<br/>committed to maintaining a single track schedule at all District schools.</p>
