<p>7.2.4 In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year, and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school<br/>year, could result in harm to the grieved person, the time limits set forth<br/>herein will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to<br/>the end of the school year or as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the<br/>grievance, or when the grievant should have reasonably known of the occurrence<br/>of the act or omission, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an informal<br/>conference with the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level</p>
<p>7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: Within ten (10) days after the infonnal conference, if there is<br/>no satisfactory settlement of the grievance, the grievant must present the<br/>grievance in writing to the immediate supervisor on the District<br/>Grievance Form.</p>

<p>Association may proceed to Level 4. During the pendency of mediation,<br/>the time lines for further processing of the grievance shall be stayed.</p>
<p>7.4.4 Level Four-Binding Arbitration: In the event the grievance is not</p>
<p>adjusted at Level Three, the Association may submit a written request to<br/>the Superintendent or designee for arbitration.

<p>The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify<br/>the terms of this Agreement, nor shall the arbitrator be empowered to<br/>render a decision contrary to law, on issue(s) not before the arbitrator<br/>nor on facts not supported by the evidence. Any costs of a hearing room<br/>and the fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by both<br/>parties. Concerning transcripts, the cost shall be borne equally by the<br/>parties if the transcript is requested by the arbitrator or both parties. If a<br/>copy of the transcript is requested by only one (1) party, that party shall<br/>incur the expense. All other expenses shall be borne by the party<br/>incurring them. The findings and decision of the arbitrator shall be final<br/>and binding on all parties subject to established right of judicial review.</p>
<p>7.5 Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>7.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant shall be entitled to representation at each step of the<br/>grievance procedure by a person designated by the Association.</p>
<p>7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines in this procedure may be extended by written mutual<br/>agreement between the parties.</p>

<p>7.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the same complaint or substantially the same complaint is made by<br/>more than one employee against one party, only one employee on behalf<br/>of himself/herself and the other grievant may process the grievance<br/>through the grievance procedure.

<p>7.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the pendency of any proceeding, and until a final determination<br/>has been reached, all proceedings shall be private and any preliminary<br/>disposition shall not be public without the written agreement of all<br/>parties.</p>
<p>7.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the<br/>District to proceed in carrying out its management responsibilities<br/>subject to final decision of the grievance. In the event the alleged<br/>grievance involved an order, requirement, etc., the aggrieved shall fulfill<br/>or carry out such order or requirement, etc., pending the decision of the<br/>grievance.</p>

<p>ARTICLE IX - LEAVE POLICIES</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Illness</p>
<p>Sick leave is granted to all certificated employees for a period of eleven (11) days<br/>per year. Essential treatments, examinations for diagnostic purposes, and other<br/>absences definitely related to a certificated employee’s health may be allowed as<br/>sick leave when such treatments or examinations need to be made during school<br/>time. An employee may be required to secure doctor’s verification of illness if he<br/>has been on sick leave for five (5) consecutive school days.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illness or Quarantine</p>
<p>Certificated employees absent due to illness or quarantine imposed by health<br/>authorities shall have no salary deductions if such absence period is covered by<br/>days accumulated for sick leave. Partial days shall be computed by the hour.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence for Illness beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each member with a written statement of<br/>his/her accrued sick leave total. Such statement shall be provided at the<br/>beginning of each school year with the first paycheck. For the purpose of<br/>calculating sick leave a day equals 7 (seven) hours.</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a period of up to five months, certificated employees absent for<br/>illness beyond their accumulated sick leave shall receive differential pay<br/>(their salary less the cost of substitutes).</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a substitute be paid more than the regular or long-term substitute<br/>rate, the district shall incur the cost of the difference between the two<br/>rates.</p>
<p>9.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees absent for illness beyond the number of days<br/>accumulated for sick leave shall have deducted from their salaries the<br/>amount paid to substitute teachers for those days beyond sick leave<br/>allowance for the period of five months. The Board shall provide each<br/>teacher with a written statement of (1) his accrued sick leave total and<br/>(2) his sick leave entitlement for the school year. Such statement shall be<br/>provided each school year.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational Trips</p>
<p>Absence with pay will be allowed by the District Superintendent for approved<br/>trips to educational conferences or trips involving school business. The Board of</p>
<p>Modified June 25, 2014</p>
<p>Gridley Unified School District/Gridley Teacher’s Association</p>
<p>Trustees’ advance approval will be required for overnight or longer trips<br/>involving students.</p>
<p>9.5 Personal Necessity</p>
<p>Any days of leave for illness or injury granted by law may be used by the<br/>certificated employees, at their election, in cases of personal necessity. A<br/>maximum of seven (7) days of accumulated leave may be used in any school year<br/>for personal necessity leave. Personal necessity leave shall be limited to<br/>circumstances that:</p>
<p>9.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are serious (emergency) in nature.</p>
<p>9.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee cannot reasonably be expected to disregard.</p>
<p>9.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Necessitates immediate action.</p>
<p>9.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot be taken care of after work hours or on weekends.</p>
<p>Examples, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>9.5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in court as a litigant.</p>
<p>9.5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic problems and personal family problems that meet<br/>the criteria of numbers 9.5.1 through 9.5.4 above shall be<br/>considered as personal necessity conditions at the request of<br/>the employee.</p>
<p>Advance permission of the District shall not be required for the following<br/>reasons:</p>
<p>9.5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the immediate<br/>family.</p>
<p>9.5.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving his person or property or the person or<br/>property of a member of the immediate family.</p>
<p>Other requests for Personal Necessity Leave should be submitted in writing in<br/>advance of the date of the requested leave, excepting in those cases wherein an<br/>emergency would preclude the employee from executing such written request. In<br/>that instance, the employee shall attempt to make verbal contact with his<br/>immediate supervisor indicating his request for Personal Necessity Leave.</p>
<p>In those situations when written permission is not required or cannot be<br/>accomplished due to an emergency, the form requesting Personal Necessity Leave<br/>shall be completed by the employee upon return from his/her leave. The request<br/>must include a brief statement of the personal necessity (i.e., personal problems,<br/>or car broke down). The principal may, at his/her discretion, request an interview<br/>with the employee to further determine the nature of the leave. If, in the<br/>principal’s judgment, the leave does not fulfill the criteria for Personal Necessity<br/>Leave, he/she shall so notify the employee of this decision in writing together</p>
<p>Modified June 25,2014</p>
<p>Gridley Unified School District/Gridley Teacher’s Association</p>
<p>with the reasons for the decision, at which time the employee shall sign this<br/>notification thereby signifying that the principal has correctly represented the<br/>requested leave and the reasons for refusing this leave. If the principal determines<br/>such personal necessity has been indicated, the Personal Necessity Leave will be<br/>granted.</p>
<p>Requests for personal Necessity Leave by any certificated employee not<br/>immediately responsible to a principal are subject to the same criteria and shall be<br/>submitted to his/her immediate supervisor.</p>

<p>14. ARTICLE XIV - EVALUATION CALENDAR/PROCEDURES</p>
<p>In the Gridley Unified School District, the basic purpose of supervision is to improve the<br/>instructional program. While the evaluation function is a necessary and important<br/>professional responsibility, we believe that all activities related to supervision are<br/>designed to improve instruction and only secondarily are they to be a part of the<br/>evaluation process. The supervision program in the Gridley Unified School District is a<br/>professional assistance program.</p>
<p>14.1 Frequency of Evaluation</p>
<p>14.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary/Temporary Unit Members</p>
<p>Each probationary and/or temporary unit member shall be evaluated on a<br/>continuing basis. A formal evaluation shall be completed each school<br/>year. These unit members will also receive interim evaluation on or<br/>before December l<sup>bl</sup> and on or before February 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>14.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Unit Members</p>
<p>Each permanent unit member shall be evaluated on a continuing basis.<br/>Permanent unit members who have not been employed at least ten years<br/>with the school district and are performing satisfactorily shall be<br/>formally evaluated at least once every other year.</p>
<p>Permanent unit members who qualify shall be evaluated at least every<br/>five years. This applies to personnel with permanent status who have<br/>been employed at least ten years with the school district, are highly<br/>qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec 7801, and whose previous<br/>evaluation rated the employee as meeting standards if the evaluator and<br/>the certificated employee being evaluated agree. The certificated<br/>employee or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time.</p>
<p>Permanent unit members given a rating of “Progress Not Evident or<br/>Unsatisfactory” in any category on the Formal Evaluation Summary<br/>shall be formally evaluated each school year.</p>
<p>14.1.2.1 Members receiving a rating of “Progress Not Evident or</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory&quot; in one (1) out of the first four (4) categories<br/>shall be rated “unsatisfactory” on an observation and will<br/>need to develop a Growth Plan. Members receiving a rating<br/>of “Progress Not Evident or Unsatisfactory” in a majority of<br/>categories shall be rated unsatisfactory during the first<br/>observation period and a Growth Plan shall be developed. In<br/>order for the category to be unsatisfactory, a majority of<br/>elements must be marked “Progress Not Evident or</p>
<p>Modified June 25, 2014</p>
<p>Gridley Unified School District/Gridley Teacher’s Association</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory”. If improvement is not made by the end of<br/>the year the unit member may be referred to PAR.</p>
<p>A rubric shall be developed during the first year to define<br/>“Progress Evident, Progress Not Evident or Unsatisfactory”<br/>(Appendix E)</p>
<p>14.1.2.2 Unsatisfactory Overload: If a significantly greater number of<br/>teachers in the first years of PAR receive an overall rating of<br/>unsatisfactory compared to the number that received an<br/>overall unsatisfactory in 2013-14, the administrator will be<br/>asked to prove that each unit members’ teaching behavior has<br/>changed dramatically since their last individual evaluation.<br/>This must be done before the teachers begin the PAR<br/>process.</p>
<p>14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Area of Evaluation</p>
<p>14.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall evaluate and assess certificated unit member<br/>performance as it reasonably relates to:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in learning</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and maintaining effective environments for student<br/>learning</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and organizing subject for student learning</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all<br/>students</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing student learning</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a professional educator</p>
<p>Non-instructional unit members shall be evaluated on the fulfillment of<br/>duties as defined in their job descriptions. Upon request, unit members<br/>will be provided a copy of their job description.</p>
<p>14.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of a unit member shall not include or be based on the<br/>following:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standardized achievement tests</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of any tests utilized for the purpose of school<br/>improvement.</p>
<p>(3) Achievement of objectives stated in IEP’s of Special Education<br/>students.</p>
<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of Publishers’ Norms</p>
<p>The evaluation and assessment of unit member’s performance pursuant to this<br/>Article shall not include the use of publishers’ norms established by standardized<br/>tests.</p>

For temporary and<br/>probationary unit members, the first formal observation shall be<br/>conducted no later than December 1; and</p>
<p>14.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mutual agreement, any of the following may be included as<br/>documentation of progress toward meeting District standards in the areas<br/>of evaluation described in Section 14.2: video tapes, curriculum units,<br/>teacher journals, logs and calendars, interviews, lesson plans, evidence<br/>of communications with parents/students, examples of student work,<br/>records of participation in school improvement efforts, and reports on<br/>professional growth activities.</p>
<p>14.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Observations/Post Observation Conferences</p>
<p>Each evaluation plan shall include a minimum of two (2) formal classroom<br/>observations, and each formal classroom observation shall be a minimum of thirty<br/>(30) minutes. Prior to the first observation, the District shall give the unit member<br/>at least two (2) days notice. Within ten (10) days after each formal classroom<br/>observation, the evaluator shall hold a post observation conference. In addition to<br/>the formal observation, the evaluator shall informally observe the unit member at<br/>least twice during each evaluation year.</p>
<p>With agreement of both the unit member and the evaluator, the number of formal<br/>observations may be reduced to two (2) or one (1) and the number of informal<br/>observations may be reduced from two (2) to one (1).</p>

<p>14.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee shall have the right to initiate a written response to the<br/>evaluation, and that response shall become a permanent attachment to<br/>the evaluatee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>14.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative/unsatisfactory evaluation shall be predicated upon<br/>information or material of a derogatory or critical nature, which has been<br/>received by the evaluator from students, parents and/or citizens, unless<br/>the Complaints Concerning School Personnel procedures, AR 1400.02,<br/>(see appendix C attached) have been followed. Complaints which are<br/>withdrawn, shown to be false, or are not sustained by the complaint<br/>procedure shall neither be placed in the unit member’s personnel file nor<br/>utilized in any evaluation, assignment or disciplinary action against the<br/>unit member.</p>
<p>14.8 Alternative Eval uation</p>

<p>14.8.1 Participants</p>
<p>The following certificated personnel will be eligible to participate in an<br/>alternative evaluation program.</p>
<p>14.8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All permanent certificated employees.</p>

<p>outlined in Article 14 of the Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>14.8.1.5 Teachers whose participation in the alternative evaluation<br/>program is judged to detract from the teacher’s instructional<br/>and professional performance may be reassigned during the<br/>year to the traditional evaluation process as outlined in<br/>Article 14 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between<br/>the District and GTA. The administrator must specify to the<br/>affected teacher, in writing, the reasons for the evaluation<br/>reassignment.</p>
<p>14.8.2 Process</p>

<p>14.8.2.3 Collaboration</p>
<p>The District and Gridley Teachers Association believe the<br/>most effective professional growth occurs through<br/>collaboration. The teacher and the site administrator will<br/>work together in the selection of the options of the<br/>development of the specific activities.</p>
<p>All participants in the alternative evaluation option will be<br/>encouraged to share the progress and results of their<br/>alternative individual or educational team activities with<br/>other colleagues.

<p>APPENDIX C—ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION 1400.02 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE*<br/>Complaints Concerning School Personnel</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall determine whether a complaint should be considered a complaint<br/>against the district and/or an individual, and whether it should be resolved by the district's process for<br/>complaints concerning personnel, other district procedures, or both.</p>
<p>In order to promote fair and constructive communication, the following procedures shall govern the<br/>resolution of complaints against district employees.</p>
<p>Level 1</p>
<p>1. Every effort should be made to resolve a complaint at the earliest possible stage. Whenever</p>
<p>possible, complaints concerning school personnel shall be made directly by the complainant to<br/>the person against whom the complaint is made. Parents/guardians are encouraged to attempt to<br/>orally resolve concerns with the staff member personally.</p>
<p>If the complaint goes directly to the principal/supervisor, the principal/supervisor shall notify the<br/>employee alter such a meeting. The principal shall then encourage the complainant to meet with<br/>the employee.</p>
<p>If the complainant declines to meet with the employee, then the principal/supervisor will<br/>schedule a meeting with the complainant, principal/supervisor, and the employee. Before the<br/>meeting, the principal/supervisor shall meet with the employee.</p>
<p>If the employee feels that possible disciplinary action will be taken, the unit member may choose<br/>to have representation at any level. However, attempts will be made to settle without involving<br/>another party.</p>
<p>Level 2</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint is not resolved at Level 1, the complainant may submit the complaint in writing<br/>to the school principal or immediate supervisor. When necessary, district administrative staff<br/>shall assist in the preparation of the written complaint so as to meet the requirement of this<br/>regulation. The administrative staff shall inform the complainant that such assistance is available<br/>if he/she requests assistance in preparing the written complaint or is unable to prepare the written<br/>complaint without help.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All complaints related to district personnel other than administrators shall be submitted in<br/>writing to the principal or immediate supervisor. Complaints related to a principal or central<br/>office administrator shall be initially filed in writing with the Superintendent or designee.<br/>Complaints related to a Board member or to the Superintendent shall be initially filed in writing<br/>with the Board.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written complaint must include:</p>
<p>a. The name of each employee involved.</p>
<p>Modified June 25. 2014 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C“1</p>

<p>4.</p></td><td>
<p>c. A specific description of any prior attempt to discuss the complaint with the employee<br/>involved and the failure to resolve the matter. A copy of the written complaint will be<br/>given to the employee.</p>
<p>The principal or immediate supervisor is responsible for investigating complaints and will<br/>attempt to resolve the complaint to the satisfaction of the person(s) involved within 30 days. If<br/>the complaint is resolved, the principal will so advise all concerned parties, including the<br/>Superintendent or designee.</p></td></tr>

A copy will be sent to the employee.</p></td></tr>

<p>Before the Board holds a closed session to hear complaints or charges brought against an<br/>employee, the employee shall receive written notice of his/her right to have the complaints or<br/>charges heard in open session rather than closed session. This notice shall be delivered<br/>personally or by mail at least 24 hours before the time of the session, and the employee may<br/>request that the complaints or charges be heard in open session. Complaints concerning Board<br/>members shall be addressed in open session unless a closed session is warranted pursuant to<br/>Education Code 35146 or 48918 or Government Code 54957 or 54957.6 (Government Code<br/>54957)</p>

<p>Complaints Regarding Child Abuse</p>
<p>When a complaint of child abuse is alleged against a district employee at a school site, the district shall<br/>provide parents/guardians with procedures for filing a child abuse complaint with the appropriate child<br/>protective agencies. Upon request, such procedures shall be written in the primary language of the<br/>parent/guardian, and the Superintendent or designee shall provide an interpreter if needed. (E.C. 48987)</p>
<p>Providing the above procedures to parents/guardians does not relieve mandated reporters from their duty<br/>to report suspected child abuse in accordance with law.</p>
