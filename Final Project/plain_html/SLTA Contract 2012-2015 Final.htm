<p>ARTICLE V- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. Definition</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 'grievance' is a formal written allegation by a Member of the<br/>Bargaining Unit that he or she has been adversely affected by a<br/>violation or misinterpretation of a written provision of this Agreement.<br/>A similar allegation filed by the Association shall also qualify as a<br/>&quot;grievance&quot;. Appeal of any law, district policy, or administrative decision<br/>not covered by this Agreement shall not be subject to the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; may be any member of the bargaining unit governed by the<br/>term of this Agreement or the Association.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the central administrative offices of the San<br/>Leandro Unified School District are open for business.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Immediate Supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having<br/>immediate jurisdiction over the grievant who has been designated to<br/>adjust grievance.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance form” is a mutually agreed upon form between the District<br/>and the Association that should be used when filing a formal grievance.</p>
<p>B. Informal Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant will attempt to<br/>resolve the problem by at least one private conference with his/her<br/>immediate supervisor. All discussions and problem resolution reached<br/>through this process shall be deemed to have preceded the formal<br/>grievance procedure and shall not be subject to intervention or<br/>response of the Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem is not resolved at the informal level, then the grievant<br/>may declare that a grievance exists and invoke the following formal<br/>procedures:</p>
<p>C. Formal Level I</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A formal written grievance must be presented to the immediate<br/>supervisor. This will included a clear, concise statement of the alleged<br/>grievance, the circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the<br/>informal conference, and the specific remedy sought. Formal<br/>grievances are to be filed on the agreed upon grievance form.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written statement must be presented to the immediate supervisor.<br/>This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the alleged</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>grievance, the circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the<br/>informal conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conferee may be present at this or any other level of the procedure.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall communicate his/her decision to the<br/>employee in writing within ten (10) days after receiving the written<br/>statement. If the immediate supervisor does not respond within the<br/>time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limits either party may request a personal<br/>conference.</p>
<p>D. Formal Level II</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, he/she may<br/>within ten (10) days appeal the decision to the Superintendent of<br/>Schools.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal shall include a copy of the original grievance, the decision<br/>rendered by the immediate supervisor and a clear, concise statement<br/>of the reasons for the appeal and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall communicate his decision to the grievant<br/>within ten (10) days. If the Superintendent does not respond within the<br/>time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall communicate his/her decision to the<br/>grievant within ten (10) days of receipt of the written appeal of the<br/>decision made at Formal Level I. If the Superintendent does not<br/>respond within the time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the<br/>next level.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Superintendent is reviewing the grievance, either the<br/>District or the Association may request a conference involving the<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources and the President of the<br/>Association, or their delegates. The purpose of this conference is to<br/>explore ways of reaching mutual agreement for the resolution of all or<br/>part of the grievance, prior to the Superintendent issuing a formal<br/>decision on the grievance.</p>
<p>E. Formal Level III</p>
<p>1. If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, he/she may<br/>appeal the decision in writing within ten (10) days to the Board of<br/>Education. Alternatively the Grievant may request that the matter<br/>proceed directly to arbitration as provided for in Formal Level IV.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal shall include a copy of the original grievances, the decision<br/>rendered by the immediate supervisor and the Superintendent, and a<br/>clear and concise statement of the reason for the appeal and the specific<br/>remedy sought.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Education shall consider the grievance within thirty (30)<br/>days of the filing of the appeal with the Board of Education, and it shall<br/>issue its decision within fifteen (15) days following the conclusion of its<br/>consideration on the appeal. If the Board of Education does not<br/>respond within the time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the<br/>next Level.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the Board of Education's decision, the grievant may request to<br/>make a presentation before the governing Board. If such a request is<br/>granted by the Board of Education, the presentation shall be made in<br/>closed session if consistent with legal requirements.</p>
<p>Formal Level IV</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II or III, he/she<br/>may request of the Association that the unresolved grievance be<br/>submitted to arbitration. After receipt of the written decision of the<br/>Superintendent or the Board of Education, the Association shall give<br/>written notice within ten (10) days of the intent to arbitrate the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association’s notice of intent to arbitrate is issued within ten (10)<br/>days following the Superintendent’s written decision, the Board of<br/>Education shall have ten (10) days to provide written notification of its<br/>desire to have the matter directly heard by the Board of Education as<br/>provided for in Formal Level III. If this occurs, procedures set forth in<br/>Level III shall be followed by all the parties including the holding of a<br/>hearing before the Board of Education within thirty (30) days of the<br/>filing of the appeal requesting arbitration. Consistent with this time<br/>limit, the Board of Education shall set the hearing date at the time it<br/>notifies the Association of its intent to hear the grievance. The Board<br/>of Education’s decision shall be issued within fifteen (15) days following<br/>the conclusion of its consideration of the appeal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to avoid unnecessary delay, the procedures provided for<br/>below to select an arbitrator and establish a hearing date shall continue<br/>at the same time the Board of Education proceedings are taking place.<br/>It is expected that the selection of the arbitrator and agreement upon a<br/>date for the arbitration hearing will occur prior to the Board of<br/>Education’s decision on the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>The first day of any arbitration cannot take place any sooner than<br/>thirty(30) days following receipt of the Board of Education’s decision or<br/>expiration of time period for the issuance of such a decision, but should</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>be scheduled as close as possible to the lapsing of this thirty(30) day<br/>period. Within ten (10) day following the Board of Education’s decision,<br/>the Association will notify the District of whether the grievance will<br/>continue to arbitration.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expense of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne<br/>equally by the District and the Association. All other expenses shall be<br/>borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the arbitration is requested within (10) days following the<br/>Superintendent’s decision, the Association and the District will attempt<br/>to agree upon an arbitrator following receipt by the District of notice of<br/>intent to arbitrate from the Association. If no agreement can be reached<br/>within (5) days, they shall request the State Conciliation Service to<br/>supply a panel of five (5) names of persons experienced in hearing<br/>grievances in public schools. Either party may request a second list.<br/>Within five (5) days following receipt of the list to be used, each party<br/>shall alternatively strike a name until only one (1) name remains. The<br/>remaining panel member shall be the arbitrator. The party to strike<br/>the first name shall be decided by the toss of a coin. The arbitrator<br/>shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the<br/>issue or issues submitted to him/her. If the parties cannot agree upon<br/>the issue or issues, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by<br/>referring to the written grievance and answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from or modify<br/>the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have an opportunity to make<br/>written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties<br/>his/her findings and award. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final<br/>and binding.</p>
<p>G. General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time limit set forth may be extended or compressed only by mutual<br/>consent of the parties.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of<br/>the administration at a level above the principal or immediate<br/>supervisor, the grievant shall submit such grievance in writing directly<br/>to Level II.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter shall be entertained as a grievance unless it has been raised<br/>at the informal level and has been filed formally with the other party<br/>within ten (10) days after the aggrieved becomes aware, or should have<br/>become aware, of the incident which created the problem.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that a grievance is raised by an employee, regardless of its<br/>ultimate disposition, shall not be recorded in the employee's personnel<br/>file or in any file or record utilized in the promotion process; nor shall<br/>such fact be used in any recommendations for job placement; nor shall<br/>an employee be placed in jeopardy or be subject to reprisal for having<br/>followed this grievance procedure.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration shall retain the right to take appropriate employee<br/>disciplinary action whenever circumstances indicate such to be<br/>necessary and proper regardless of whether a grievance has been filed.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance procedure is not intended to be a method to challenge or<br/>change the law or the rules and regulations of the Board nor will it be<br/>utilized if there are other means of review which are specifically<br/>prescribed in law, district policy, or this agreement.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting the<br/>right of any Bargaining Unit Member having a grievance to discuss the<br/>matter directly with the appropriate member of the administration and<br/>to have the problem and/or grievance adjusted at any level without<br/>intervention of the Association, except that no adjustment of the<br/>grievance at a formal level will be made until the exclusive bargaining<br/>agent has been notified in writing and given a chance to respond.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable number of representatives of the exclusive representative<br/>shall have the right to receive reasonable periods of release time without<br/>loss of compensation for the processing of grievances.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VI - ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>Any Unit Member who is a member of the San Leandro Teachers'<br/>Association/CTA/NEA, or who has applied for membership, may sign and<br/>deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of unified<br/>membership dues and initiation fees. Pursuant to such authorization, the<br/>District shall deduct one-tenth (1/10) of such dues from the regular salary<br/>check of the Unit Member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for<br/>Unit Members who sign such authorization after the commencement of the<br/>school year shall be appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end<br/>of the school year.</p>
<p>Any Unit Member who is not a member of the San Leandro Teachers'<br/>Association/CTA/NEA, or who does not make application for membership<br/>within thirty (30) days of the ratification of this Agreement, or within forty five<br/>(45) days from the date of commencement of assigned duties within the<br/>bargaining unit, shall become a member of the Association or pay to the<br/>Association a fee in an amount equal to unified membership dues and<br/>initiation fees, payable to the Association in one lump sum cash payment in<br/>the same manner as required for the payment of membership dues and<br/>initiation fees provided, however, that the Unit Member may authorize payroll<br/>deduction for such fee in the same manner as provided in Section A of this<br/>Article. In the event that a Unit Member shall not pay such fee directly to the<br/>Association, or authorize payment through payroll deductions as provided in<br/>Section A, the Association shall so inform the District, and the District shall<br/>begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in Education Code Section<br/>45061 and in the same manner as set forth in Section A of this Article. There<br/>shall be no charge to the Association for such mandatory agency fee<br/>deductions.</p>
<p>Any Unit Member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional<br/>tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting<br/>employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support<br/>SLTA/CTA/NEA as a condition of employment; except that such Unit Member<br/>shall pay, in lieu of a service fee, a sum equal to such service fee to one of the<br/>following non-religious, non-labor organizations, charitable funds exempt<br/>from taxation under Section 501 (c) (3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue<br/>Code:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHAD</p>
<p>Such payment shall be made on or before October 15 of each school year, or<br/>within 30 days of commencing assigned duties for a new employee during the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>Proof of payment and a written statement of objection along with verifiable<br/>evidence of membership in a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings object to joining or financially supporting employee organizations,</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>pursuant to Section C above, shall be made on an annual basis to the<br/>Association and District as a condition of continued exemption from the<br/>provisions of Sections A and B above. Proof of payment shall be in the form<br/>of receipts and/or cancelled checks indicating the amount paid, date of<br/>payment, and to whom payment, in lieu of the service fee, has been made.<br/>Such proof shall be presented on or before November 1 of each school year,<br/>or within 45 days of commencing assigned duties for a new employee<br/>employed during the school year.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VII - HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduled work-site day shall be six hours and forty minutes exclusive<br/>of a duty-free lunch period. The length of the work-site day shall be the same<br/>for all full-time Bargaining Unit Members. Elementary and middle school<br/>Bargaining Unit Members shall be accessible to assist students at the work¬<br/>site fifteen (15) minutes before and twenty (20) minutes after school. High<br/>school Bargaining Unit Members shall be similarly available to students<br/>fifteen minutes before and fifteen minutes after school. These before and after<br/>school periods described above are part of the six-hour and forty minute work<br/>site day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining Unit Members shall perform reasonable duties assigned after<br/>work-site hours to accomplish their professional responsibilities. This shall<br/>include participation in the following meetings: (a) At the secondary level, 10<br/>faculty meetings per year not to exceed 90 minutes each and 10 department<br/>meetings per year not to exceed 75 minutes each. At the elementary level, 10<br/>faculty meetings plus here (3) “floating” faculty meetings per year that shall<br/>not exceed 90 minutes. Emergency faculty meetings shall not be included in<br/>these averages or covered by the minute limitation; (b) State required<br/>meetings; (c) Open House; (d) Back to School Night; (e) supervision of student<br/>activities; (f) other meetings or functions mutually agreed upon by the<br/>Bargaining Unit Member and the principal or immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common planning period will be maintained for elementary schools and<br/>middle schools. Common planning time will be coordinated by the site<br/>principal in collaboration with the leadership team and in alignment with<br/>District goals and the School Site Plan, which addresses student needs<br/>derived from an annual examination of student achievement data, and<br/>implemented by individuals and/or subcommittees.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Bargaining Unit Members shall have time assigned for preparation and<br/>planning. A preparation period is defined as a sustained block of time<br/>scheduled without students during the students' school day. Preparation<br/>time will be used by Bargaining Unit Members to plan and conduct activities<br/>necessary to present courses of instruction to students. Other duties<br/>mutually agreed upon by the Bargaining Unit Member and his/her principal<br/>or immediate supervisor may be assigned during the preparation period. This<br/>does not preclude scheduled conferences with administrators, other teachers,<br/>parents or students during the preparation and planning time. (See Side<br/>Letter)</p>
<p>Every elementary Bargaining Unit Member shall have four preparation<br/>periods per week of 45 consecutive minutes and one period per week from<br/>1:50 — 2:30 p.m. on the early dismissal day. Secondary teachers shall have<br/>five periods per week (one per day) set aside for preparation and planning.<br/>Preparation periods are available during the student days.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every elementary school Bargaining Unit Member shall have a 45-minute<br/>uninterrupted duty free lunch period each day. Every secondary school<br/>Bargaining Unit Member shall have a daily uninterrupted duty free lunch<br/>period equal in length to the student lunch period. No teacher will be<br/>assigned supervision duties during the lunch period of their own students.<br/>However, the school Principal or designee shall have the right to assign<br/>supervisory responsibilities in the event of an emergency, which might<br/>adversely affect the health or safety of students.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All preparation periods provided Bargaining Unit Members shall be<br/>considered assigned time. A Bargaining Unit Member shall be assigned to<br/>substitute for in-lieu time only for the sudden, unanticipated absence of<br/>another teacher or as mutually agreed upon by the Bargaining Unit member<br/>and his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Librarians, counselors, nurses, teachers on special assignment, and other<br/>Bargaining Unit Members who have limited or no teaching assignments will<br/>be assigned hours of employment by their immediate supervisors. The length<br/>of the workday will not exceed that of teaching members.</p>
<p>A teacher on special assignment is defined as a classroom teacher in the<br/>bargaining unit, who performs non-teaching or non-counseling duties. All<br/>teachers on special assignment positions must be posted for internal<br/>candidates. The assigned duties of a teacher on special assignment shall be<br/>specific in nature and limited to a period of no more than three years.<br/>Teachers on special assignment completing their term may reapply for<br/>teacher on special assignment positions.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kindergarten teachers' scheduled student contact time shall be 290<br/>minutes per day for four (4) days and 210 minutes on Wednesdays. This<br/>student contact time is inclusive of recesses. The kindergarten teachers'<br/>workday shall be the same as all other Bargaining Unit Members.<br/>Kindergarten teachers' preparation and planning time shall be exclusive of<br/>the above student contact time. Kindergarten teachers are not expected to<br/>supervise, during the small-group instructional time, those students not<br/>assigned to that time.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the majority of the Bargaining Unit Members at any school site are<br/>required to return to school for a school program, they shall be provided with<br/>a minimum day. Back to School Night and Open House will not be scheduled<br/>on an already-shortened day.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of time that each Bargaining Unit Member spends on required<br/>non-teaching duties shall be reasonable, and fairly distributed among the<br/>school staff.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number and length of periods at the continuation school shall be<br/>determined by its site administrator and Superintendent or designee in<br/>consultation with the staff.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Staff Development Day per year shall be used for parent conference days<br/>at each elementary site. Commencing with the 1995/96 school year, two full<br/>parent conference days shall be scheduled at each elementary site. One of<br/>these days is expected to begin late morning or early afternoon and conclude<br/>late afternoon or early evening. One parent conference day shall be<br/>designated a staff development day and the other parent conference day shall<br/>be in-lieu of one-half of a planning day and one-half of the Institute Day.<br/>(1995-96 &amp; 1996-97 calendars to be adjusted accordingly). For the 95-96<br/>school year, the 1/26/96 elementary school planning day will be a staff<br/>development day.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth and fifth grade classes shall have two additional early release dates<br/>for parent conferences provided there is at least thirty days advance<br/>notification of the parents. This provision becomes effective for the 1999 -<br/>2000 school year and shall expire when and if class sizes are reduced to levels<br/>consistent with other elementary classes.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All principals will provide unit members their tentative assignments five (5)<br/>workdays prior to the end of the teacher work year. Assignments shall<br/>include:</p>
<p>Elementary: Grade level and school site</p>
<p>Middle School: Grade level(s), subject(s), and school site</p>
<p>High School: Subject area(s) and school site</p>

<p>ARTICLE Vm - JOB SHARING</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing shall refer to two teachers, each of whom share between 40 and<br/>60 percent of one full time assignment. At least one of the job-sharing<br/>teachers must be a permanent teacher on a regular contract. Job sharing<br/>may include working in the regular or year-round program. Two Unit<br/>Members may share an assignment for a minimum of one year. Initial job<br/>sharing requests can be made singularly (District will attempt to match) or as<br/>a team of two teachers. Any job-sharing request by any teacher beyond one<br/>year must be as a team. Applications for a job-sharing assignment for the<br/>following school year shall be filed with the District no later than March 1<sup>st</sup>.<br/>Job-sharing is encouraged where it can be demonstrated that there will be a<br/>maintenance or improvement in the educational advantage to students and<br/>when it will create minimal scheduling, curricular, or administrative<br/>problems.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced assignment shall refer to a permanent member on a regular contract<br/>requesting a partial leave of absence. Applications for a reduced assignment<br/>for the following school year shall be filed with the District no later than March<br/>1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall approve or deny requests and notify, in writing, the<br/>applicants of its decision by May 1<sup>st</sup>. If a request is denied, the applicants<br/>shall be notified, in writing, of the specific reasons for the denial.<br/>Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, job-sharing and reduced<br/>assignment Unit Members' wages, benefits (except retiree health benefits),<br/>and paid leaves shall be prorated relative to the actual time worked. In no<br/>event shall the total amount of health and welfare benefits for the job-sharers<br/>exceed the amount the District would have paid if the position had not been<br/>shared.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each job-sharing and reduced assignment Unit Member otherwise eligible for<br/>full-time employment shall receive a salary schedule increment each year as<br/>of implementation of this Agreement. This provision is not retroactive. This<br/>provision applies, provided all legally and contractually necessary<br/>requirements for the increments have been otherwise met.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members requesting a job-share assignment will prepare and submit to the<br/>principal a proposed plan noting the specific days to be worked, planning time<br/>usage, attendance at meetings, parent conferencing and report card<br/>responsibilities. Attendance at staff development meetings will normally be a<br/>requirement of both members. A copy of the proposed plan shall be included<br/>with the application.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of a reduced assignment Member or two job-sharing Members,<br/>a reduced assignment or job-sharing assignment may be renewed provided<br/>application is made prior to March 1. In the event the Unit Members fail to<br/>notify the District of their desire to continue in the reduced assignment or job<br/>sharing assignment, or in the event the District does not approve the</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>continuance of the assignments, the Unit Members shall be returned to full¬<br/>time assignments.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Unit Member on a regular contract is in a reduced assignment or job¬<br/>sharing assignment and elects to return after the first year to full-time<br/>teaching, the Unit Member will be returned to his/her original school, unless<br/>precluded by declining enrollment at the original school and there is no one<br/>at the school with less seniority or compliance with federal and/or state<br/>mandates or court actions. If a Unit Member on a regular contract is in a<br/>reduced assignment or job-sharing assignment for more than one year and<br/>elects to return to full-time teaching, the Unit Member will be assigned to the<br/>first available full-time teaching position for which he/she is certificated in<br/>conformance with the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Unit Member shall be assured of a reduced assignment or a job-sharing<br/>assignment longer than five consecutive years unless the reason for the<br/>reduced assignment or job-sharing assignment is a documented medical<br/>reason. The 1st year of the five (5) year limitation begins with the 1996/97<br/>school year.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Unit Member requests and is granted a reduced assignment or a job¬<br/>sharing assignment beyond the five consecutive years, the Unit Member's<br/>employment status in the District will be reduced to and based on the percent<br/>of the reduced assignment or job-sharing assignment at the end of the fifth<br/>year of a reduced assignment or a job-sharing assignment. This means that<br/>the employee will resign the percent of his/her assignment that is less than<br/>1.0 FTE.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article does not include Unit Members working in the District under an<br/>approved part-time employment plan immediately prior to retirement from<br/>the District and in conformity with appropriate Education Code sections<br/>permitting full retirement credit for less than full-time duties.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX - CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>Elementary class size shall not exceed the following:</p>
<p>District Averages<br/>K - 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29</p>
<p>Class Maximums</p>
<p>K-3</p>
<p>4-5</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Class maximums may be exceeded by one (1) with the consent of the teacher.</p>
<p>If the teacher does not consent to the permanent placement of the extra</p>
<p>student in the teacher's class, the principal may make a temporary placement</p>
<p>in that class, not to exceed five (5) school days, while securing a permanent</p>
<p>class placement elsewhere.</p>
<p>At no time during the school day shall any maximum class size be exceeded.</p>
<p>Middle Schools: Grades 6-8</p>
<p>1. In each middle school, English, Social Science, Math, and Foreign<br/>Language classes shall not exceed 35 students.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall limit class size to the available work-stations in<br/>Industrial Arts, Consumer and Home Economics, Science, Music, and<br/>Computer Science. Art/craft classes shall not exceed a maximum of<br/>thirty (30).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 1997-98 school year, both the maximum and<br/>average PE class size shall not exceed 45 students per class.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a class is jointly taught or supervised by more than one<br/>credentialed teacher, class size shall be determined be dividing the<br/>number of students by the number of credentialed teachers assigned<br/>to the class.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counselor program shall be staffed at a minimum of 5 FTE at the<br/>high school, .5 FTE at the alternative high school and 3 FTE shared<br/>between the middle schools. The counselor work year will be 194 days,<br/>which includes 8 additional workdays, which will be paid at the per<br/>diem rate beyond the SLTA 186 day work year. (This reflects an<br/>increase of three paid days for counselors.) Counselors also will have<br/>work year scheduling flexibility for up to 2 days to be reasonably<br/>scheduled during the regular school year. A new counselor salary<br/>schedule will reflect the increased work year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Independent Study program shall have a maximum load of thirty<br/>(30) to one. The District shall set initial staffing based on expected<br/>enrollment. Thereafter, hourly teachers may be used until an average<br/>of an additional twenty (20) students is enrolled, at which time an<br/>additional full-time or part-time teacher on the salary schedule shall be</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>assigned. This process may be repeated as many times as needed.<br/>Measurement of additional enrollment shall take place at least<br/>monthly. However, due to greatly fluctuating enrollment, nothing shall<br/>prevent the use of additional hourly teachers as necessary the last two<br/>months of the school year. The intent of the program is to provide<br/>quality education consistent with the economic resources of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>7. During the 1992-93 school year, the SLTA and the District agree that<br/>the class size for all sections of the 6th grade exploratory &quot;wheel&quot; shall<br/>not exceed twenty-eight (28) students.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Schools: Grades 9-12. In each secondary school, for the non¬<br/>laboratory academic classes including English, Social Science, Math, Health<br/>and Safety, Business and Foreign Language, (not including keyboarding and<br/>word processing), classes shall not exceed 35 students.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall limit class size to the available workstations in<br/>Industrial Arts, Mechanical Drawing/Drafting, Consumer and Home<br/>Economics, Science, Computer Science, Word Processing, Keyboarding,<br/>and in Music classes. Art/craft classes shall not exceed a maximum of<br/>thirty (30). Graphics classes will not exceed an average of twenty-nine<br/>(29) without the permission of the instructor.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing with the 1997-98 school year, both the maximum and<br/>average PE class size shall not exceed 45 students per class.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a class is jointly taught or supervised by more than one<br/>credentialed teacher, class size shall be determined by dividing the<br/>number of students by the number of credentialed teachers assigned<br/>to the class.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth grade English class size will be at a ratio of twenty (20) to one</p>
<p>(1) contingent upon the receipt of continued and sufficient categorical<br/>funding for this purpose.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum size for special education classes shall be those limits prescribed<br/>by law.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These class maximums will not be exceeded after fifteen (15) days for the fall<br/>semester and ten (10) days for the spring semester. The Superintendent may<br/>for good cause extend these deadlines for up to five additional days.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three weeks of having more than one class at the above maximum<br/>limits, an instructor may seek a review through a site-level class size equity<br/>review committee. This committee shall be composed of the administrator in<br/>charge of scheduling and at least two (2) Unit Members elected by the faculty.<br/>The committee shall educate Unit Members regarding scheduling<br/>requirements and may recommend schedule changes to the principal</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>provided such changes do not increase the total cost to the district. If the<br/>committee believes that the principal's decision has been arbitrary or<br/>capricious, it may be appealed to the Superintendent or designee for the final<br/>determination.</p>
<p>G. Elementary Combination Classes:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sites&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prior&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to</p>
<p>assigning teachers to combination classes. Assignments will be a one (1) year<br/>commitment and teachers will be given an opportunity to opt out of a<br/>combination class assignment for a second consecutive year. Fully<br/>credentialed teachers will be assigned to combination classes.</p>

<p>ARTICLE X - LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>Any Bargaining Unit Member with justifiable reason may, upon request, be granted<br/>a leave of absence by the Board.</p>
<p>No leave of absence may extend beyond the close of the current school year except<br/>by renewal by the Board. A Unit Member who has been on leave for more than one<br/>(1) year will not be eligible for a renewal, except as otherwise indicated in this section<br/>or approved by the Superintendent. The Member's salary is computed upon a per<br/>diem basis when adjustments are necessary.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified by the District, each Unit Member on leave must notify<br/>the District by March 1<sup>st</sup> as to whether he/she will return to employment for the<br/>following year. Such notification will be binding on the District and the Bargaining<br/>Unit Member and failure to notify the District by March 1<sup>st</sup> or failure to subsequently<br/>fulfill the commitment made on March 1<sup>st</sup> will be considered a voluntary resignation<br/>unless unusual circumstances warrant reconsideration by the Board of Education.</p>
<p>A. Sick Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulation. Every Unit Member employed five (5) days a week by<br/>the District in a position requiring certificated qualification will be<br/>entitled to one (1) day of leave of absence per month worked without<br/>loss of pay for illness or injury during each school year up to ten (10)<br/>days per year. The days of full-pay sick leave become available at the<br/>beginning of each school year of service, but no leave accumulates<br/>during a year when a Member is on leave of absence other than<br/>sabbatical. Unused leave of absence for illness or injury will be<br/>accumulated from year to year. Unit Members will be notified on or<br/>about May 1st of their sick leave entitlement.</p>
<p>The ten (10) days leave of absence need not be accrued by the Unit<br/>Member before he or she may use it; such absence may be taken at any<br/>time during the school year. Regular Bargaining Unit Members who<br/>teach less than full time shall have their sick leave prorated.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members who are home instructors will be entitled to one (1) hour<br/>of absence without loss of pay for illness or injury for each eighteen (18)<br/>hours actually worked, but not exceeding sixty (60) hours in any one<br/>school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended Illness Leave. When a Unit Member employed in a position<br/>requiring certification qualifications is absent from duty on account of<br/>illness or accident for a period of five (5) school months or less, whether<br/>or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the employment of<br/>the Member, the amount deducted from the salary due him/her for any<br/>month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the long term<br/>substitute rate during his/her absence paid the employee employed to<br/>fill his/her position during his/her absence or, if no substitute</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>employee was employed, the amount which would have been paid to<br/>the substitute had he/she been employed. The five (5) month period<br/>will begin when all accumulated sick leave has been used. This<br/>provision applies only to the illness of the employee and not to illness<br/>or other circumstances in the immediate family.</p>
<p>4. Filing of Absence Reports. To receive credit for absence under these<br/>sick leave policies, the Unit Member must complete the District's<br/>absence report form after return from illness. In case of absences of<br/>more than five (5) days, a certificate of illness or injury must be<br/>presented to the Superintendent's office, signed by a regularly licensed<br/>physician and/or medical authorization to return to work. At the<br/>discretion of the Superintendent or designee, a medical verification may<br/>be required for an absence of any duration.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members are entitled to use sick leave for disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery<br/>there from on the same terms and conditions governing leaves of<br/>absence from other illness or medical disability. Such leave shall not<br/>be used for childcare, child rearing, or preparation for child bearing,<br/>but shall be limited to those disabilities as set forth above. The length<br/>of such pregnancy disability leave, including the date on which the<br/>leave shall commence and the date on which duties are to be resumed,<br/>shall be determined by the Unit Member and the Unit Member's<br/>physician.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members are entitled to leave without pay for disabilities because<br/>of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery from when sick leave<br/>provisions have been exhausted. The date on which the employee shall<br/>resume duties shall be the day after the disability is terminated as<br/>determined by the Unit Member on leave and the Unit Member's<br/>physician.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Rearing</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the Board may provide a male or female Unit Member<br/>who is a natural or adopting parent an unpaid leave of absence for the<br/>purpose of rearing his or her child. Such leave shall remain in effect at<br/>least until the end of the semester following the birth or adoption of the<br/>child and no longer than the end of the second semester following the<br/>birth of the child.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member shall notify the Board that he or she intends to take<br/>such leave at least four (4) weeks prior to the anticipated date on which<br/>the leave is to commence. Upon request of the Unit Member the District<br/>may extend a teacher's Child Rearing leave for a maximum of one (1)<br/>year. Any Bargaining Unit Member who seeks an extension of Child</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>Rearing Leave shall make application no later than six (6) weeks<br/>preceding the expiration of the original leave.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental/Adoption Leave</p>
<p>A Unit Member may be granted two (2) days of parental leave without loss of<br/>pay during or immediately after the birth of the Unit Member's child. A Unit<br/>Member may be granted two (2) days of family leave without loss of pay during<br/>or immediately after the adoption of a child.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupational and Worker's Compensation Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee who is absent from duty because of illness or<br/>injury resulting from an accident or condition which qualifies under<br/>occupational and Worker's Compensation Insurance shall be granted<br/>an occupational leave of not to exceed sixty (60) days for the same<br/>accident in any one (1) fiscal year. Occupational leave shall be granted<br/>from the first day of disability but shall not extend beyond the last day<br/>for which temporary disability indemnity is received from the District<br/>Worker's Compensation Insurance Administrator. When the leave<br/>overlaps into the next fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only<br/>the amount of unused leave due him or her for the same illness or<br/>injury.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only absences which are supported by a doctor's certificate and have<br/>been verified by the District Worker's Compensation Insurance<br/>Administrator to be the result of a work connected injury or illness can<br/>be paid under the occupational leave policy. Any absence that cannot<br/>be so verified shall be charged against the employee's personal illness<br/>leave or other appropriate leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the employee's absence due to an occupational injury or illness<br/>extend beyond sixty (60) days, the employee shall be entitled to use<br/>accrued personal illness leave until temporary disability benefits cease,<br/>until he or she returns to duty, or until personal illness credits have<br/>been used up, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any period an employee is receiving his/her regular salary from<br/>the District, the employee is required to endorse over to the District all<br/>temporary disability benefits received from the District Worker's<br/>Compensation Insurance Administrator. Charges to the employee's<br/>leave balances shall be as follows:</p>
<p>a. Occupational leave shall be reduced by one (1) day for each day<br/>of authorized absence regardless of temporary disability<br/>payments paid by the District Worker's Compensation Insurance<br/>Administrator.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>b. Personal illness leave shall be reduced only by that amount<br/>necessary to provide a full day's wage or salary when added to<br/>temporary disability benefits.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is absent because of a work connected injury or<br/>illness shall not be entitled to receive wages or salary from the District<br/>which when added to temporary disability benefits will exceed his/her<br/>full salary during the period of his/her absence.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee receiving benefits as a result of this section shall, during<br/>periods of injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless<br/>the governing board authorizes travel outside the state.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all available leave of absence, paid or unpaid, has been<br/>exhausted and if the employee is not medically able to assume the<br/>duties of his/her position, he/she may be placed on unpaid leave of<br/>absence at which time he/she shall be granted paid health insurance<br/>benefits in the same manner as though he/ she were an active regular<br/>employee of the District.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may use up to ten (10) days of accumulated sick leave<br/>per year as personal necessity. Use of accumulated sick leave for<br/>personal necessity beyond the ten (10) day limit shall be at the<br/>discretion of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all accumulated sick leave is exhausted as provided in the above<br/>paragraph, the Superintendent or designee at his/her discretion may<br/>authorize the use of differential sick leave to be used for personal<br/>necessity. Under this provision, the Unit Member shall have the cost<br/>of a day-to-day substitute or the school cost of a substitute subtracted<br/>from the daily rate of pay.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A personal necessity is defined as an activity meeting all the following<br/>criteria: serious in nature; cannot be reasonably disregarded; can only<br/>be performed during the normal school day; and cannot be performed<br/>before or after regular school hours. Certain events or activities<br/>automatically qualify for personal necessity leave. They include: (a)<br/>death in the immediate family (as defined in Section G); (b) serious<br/>illness or injury involving the unit member or a member of his/her<br/>immediate family; (c) serious accident resulting in injury or serious<br/>property damage involving the unit member or a member of his/her<br/>immediate family; (d) medical or dental services that cannot reasonably<br/>be scheduled outside the school day; and (e) judicially required or<br/>necessary leave not otherwise covered by Section H. Certain other<br/>events or activities may also meet the above definition of personal<br/>necessity and reasonably qualify for personal necessity leave.<br/>Examples include graduation and significant award ceremonies</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>involving the unit member or a member of his/her immediate family<br/>and memorial services or other significant services involving a unit<br/>member or a member of her/her immediate family at which attendance<br/>would be reasonably expected. Absences for social or recreational<br/>activities, departing early or returning late for duty are not defined as<br/>personal necessity.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior approval is not required for taking personal necessity leave that<br/>is automatically available as described above. If it is reasonably<br/>possible, advanced notice must be given by the unit member. Within<br/>five working days of returning to duty, the unit member shall complete<br/>a personal necessity leave form by checking a box next to one or more<br/>of the applicable five types of automatically available personally<br/>necessity leave described above. This form does not require District<br/>approval, but it must be verified as true by the unit member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior approval is required for all other personal necessity leave, but<br/>shall not be unreasonably withheld. If such leave is denied by the site<br/>administrator or the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources,<br/>an immediate appeal to the Superintendent may be taken. This appeal<br/>is separate from and in addition to the grievance procedure which shall<br/>independently apply. Twice yearly an informational report will be<br/>prepared for the Board listing the number and types of personal<br/>necessity leave denied, if any. This report shall not identify the<br/>individual bargaining unit members. A copy of the report shall be<br/>provided to the Association.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use up to two (2) of the above ten (10) days of<br/>personal necessity leave without disclosing the purpose of the leave.<br/>However, such leave must be requested three (3) work days in advance<br/>of the leave, must comply with the general purpose of personal<br/>necessity leave as defined above, and no more than five (5) percent of<br/>the bargaining unit, or ten (10) percent from any one site may use such<br/>leave on the same day. If reasonable cause exists, the Superintendent<br/>may conduct a confidential investigation regarding the use of personal<br/>necessity leave under this section and section 4 above.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of this leave due to a death in the immediate family would be<br/>in addition to bereavement leave set forth in &quot;G&quot; below.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member may be required to submit additional proof to<br/>substantiate the personal necessity.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a personal necessity exists that requires no more than one (1) duty<br/>period, an employee, on approval of the site administrator, may arrange<br/>for another employee to cover his/her classes. Duty period is defined<br/>as 100 minutes. If the covering employee does not receive additional<br/>compensation or compensatory time for the coverage, such one (1) duty</p>
<p>period absence shall not be charged to a personal necessity leave nor<br/>shall the employee suffer any loss of pay.</p>
<p>Absent this agreement, the covering would normally be eligible for<br/>additional pay or compensatory time for providing substitute service<br/>during this duty period. Nonetheless, the District and the Association<br/>agree that the above voluntary procedure agreed to by all parties shall<br/>fully satisfy the requirement of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or<br/>any other legal requirement for compensation.</p>
<p>If an employee cannot arrange for another employee to cover his/her<br/>classes, the employee shall be charged in segments of 100 minutes for<br/>his/her absence.</p>
<p>Employees with in-lieu time may take such time in 100 duty period<br/>increments.</p>
<p>G. Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>No deduction in salary or sick leave entitlement shall be made for absence<br/>due to death in the immediate family or, in the alternative, for the death of<br/>the person designated on the emergency card of the employee. The term<br/>“immediate family&quot; means the following persons: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father,</p>
<p>grandmother, grandfather, or grandchild of the employee or of the spouse of<br/>the Unit Member, and the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-<br/>law, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of the employee, or any<br/>person living in the immediate household of the employee. Not more than<br/>three (3) days absence, or five (5) days, if travel over 200 miles is necessary,<br/>shall be allowed under this section (200 miles one way, 400 miles round-trip)<br/>for the purpose of attending the funeral, making funeral arrangement, or<br/>other duties and responsibilities associated with the death. These three days<br/>need not be taken at the same time; however, if this leave is being used for<br/>attendance at funeral more than 200 miles one way from the employee’s<br/>residence, up to an additional two days is available to facilitate the travel and<br/>other duties and responsibilities associated with an out-of-area funeral. In<br/>the event of the death of an employee's spouse, child, or stepchild an<br/>additional five (5) days will be added for the above purposes including<br/>grieving. All leave provided in this Section is to be taken in minimum full day<br/>increments within thirteen months of the death.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>H.</p>
<p>Judicial Leave</p>
<p>Judicial leave shall be granted without loss of pay when the Bargaining Unit<br/>Member must respond to a subpoena for jury duty or is officially required to<br/>appear on behalf of school district litigation. Jury fees will be endorsed back<br/>to the District.</p>
<p>I. Legislative Leave</p>
<p>A Bargaining Unit Member elected to the legislature shall be granted an<br/>unpaid leave of absence from his/her duties as an employee of the District.<br/>The Unit Member shall notify the District of his/her intention to return at<br/>least twelve (12) weeks in advance.</p>
<p>J. In-Lieu Time</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-lieu time is accumulated when a Bargaining Unit Member, during a<br/>preparation/work period, supervises another Member’s class for one<br/>period, as assigned by the administration, and when the unit member<br/>has begun rendering such service. At the time of rendering the service,<br/>a unit member may choose to accumulate in-lieu time, or to be paid at<br/>the in-lieu stipend rate.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may use accumulated in-lieu time for professional<br/>purposes or to supplement personal necessity leave. In-lieu days will<br/>be credited on the basis of one (1) day for each six (6) periods for<br/>elementary teachers or five (5) periods for secondary school teachers.<br/>The in-lieu time credit may accumulate from year to year but shall not<br/>exceed five (5) days. In-lieu time may be transferred to another<br/>Bargaining Unit Member by mutual consent provided it is reported to<br/>the District in advance. A list of volunteers will be developed at the<br/>beginning of each year, and can be revised through out the year. The<br/>list will be used on a rotational basis, in so far as practical. If no<br/>volunteers are available, a rotation system for bargaining unit members<br/>will be used.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a Bargaining Unit Member is assigned to substitute for another<br/>Member's class for a non-emergency as defined in Article VII, F, during<br/>preparation period, the Bargaining Unit Member shall be credited with<br/>two (2) in-lieu periods for each in-lieu period taught. This section shall<br/>apply when the District fails to secure a substitute for the absent<br/>teachers. In an emergency, in cases where regular substitutes are<br/>unavailable, and the use of administration and volunteers is not<br/>workable, the site administrator may assign a bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the students in a K-5 class are assigned to other teachers<br/>because no substitute is available, the teachers who are assigned such<br/>students shall divide the daily substitute rate. The proportion of the<br/>daily payment each teacher receives shall be the proportion of the<br/>absent teacher’s class, which is assigned to the teacher. Principals will<br/>ask for volunteers for this class coverage. Students shall be first placed<br/>with volunteers on a rotation basis. Thereafter, they will be placed with<br/>non-volunteers when necessary. Pursuant to the provision, class size<br/>maximums established by contract or law shall not be exceeded.<br/>Further payments under this provision shall be made semi-annually</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The in-lieu stipend will be $40.00 per “regular” period, and $62.00 per<br/>“block” period (which is at least 90 minutes). If less than half the block<br/>period needs to be covered by the unit member, the in-lieu stipend will<br/>be $40.00. If two bargaining unit members elect to split the coverage<br/>of the “block period”, each bargaining unit member will receive half the<br/>“block period” stipend.</p>
<p>Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing seven (7) consecutive full school years of service, a<br/>Unit Member will be eligible to apply for a one semester or one-year<br/>sabbatical leave of absence.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants for sabbatical leave must submit their request to the Human<br/>Resources Office on the appropriate form by no later than November 1<sup>st<br/></sup>of the school year preceding the school year for which the leave is<br/>requested. Unusual circumstances which cause a delay in application<br/>will be considered.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources will verify the<br/>completeness of the application, check with the principal or director<br/>concerned on the criticality of the position for the coming year, and will<br/>forward the completed application and such information to the<br/>Sabbatical Leave Committee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sabbatical Leave Committee will consist of eight (8) members. The<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources will be a member and<br/>secretary of the committee. Seven (7) members will be appointed<br/>annually by the exclusive bargaining agent. The committee will be<br/>guided by the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential of the leave to improve classroom instruction.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential to strengthen a subject matter area for which there<br/>is a need in the District.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential of the proposed leave to strengthen the over-all<br/>District program.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the committee report, the Superintendent will present<br/>his recommendation regarding the applications to the Board of<br/>Education, together with the recommendation of the Sabbatical Leave<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent to the Superintendent's recommendation, the Board of<br/>Education may grant leave based on: (1) the financial status of the<br/>District; (2) benefit of the proposed leave to the educational process.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members on sabbatical leave will receive one-half of the salary they<br/>would have been paid during the period of leave, and the appropriate<br/>salary schedule placement which would have been granted had the Unit<br/>Member not been on leave. Full fringe benefits and credit for<br/>advancement on the salary schedule will be granted to those on leave.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms and conditions of the leave shall be agreed upon in writing<br/>and shall include, but not be limited to: An indemnification bond for<br/>failure to successfully complete the sabbatical program or to render the<br/>necessary post-leave service; a stipulation to a post-leave service of not<br/>less than two (2) full years for a full year of leave, and one (1) full year<br/>for a one-half year leave; the description of the sabbatical program; and,<br/>appropriate reporting procedures as may be designated by the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>L. Military Leave</p>
<p>Military leave of absence is considered upon written request to the Board of<br/>Education. A Unit Member who is granted military leave will earn service<br/>increments the same as if teaching. Employees with a full year or more<br/>experience in this District will receive a payment of one-tenth of their annual<br/>salary when the military leave is granted provided such leave is at least thirty<br/>(30) calendar days during the work year..</p>
<p>M. Exchange Teaching</p>
<p>A permanent employee may request permission for participation in a teacher<br/>exchange program. The Board may grant his/her leave if, in the opinion of<br/>the Superintendent, the employee may be replaced, the proposed substitute<br/>is suitable and the best interests of the District will be served. Not more than<br/>one (1) such leave will be granted to a Bargaining Unit Member within a five<br/>(5) year period.</p>
<p>N. Layoff Hearing Leave</p>
<p>Release time will be granted to no more than two (2) Association<br/>representatives to attend layoff hearings conducted by an administrative law<br/>judge. The cost of the substitutes will be paid by the District.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>0.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided in this Article, Bargaining Unit Members,<br/>while on paid leave of absence, shall be entitled to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to the same general classification of position held prior to<br/>leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive monetary fringe benefits to the extent not prohibited by<br/>law or other sections of this agreement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive credit for annual salary increments granted during leave<br/>except in cases of sick leave or part-time assignment where<br/>service is not rendered for 75% of the days in the teaching<br/>calendar.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bargaining Unit Member on unpaid leave of absence shall be entitled<br/>to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to the same general classification of position held prior<br/>to leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option to continue insurance benefits at the employee's<br/>expense.</p>
<p>P. Unit Members Who Are Classified As Temporary Employees</p>
<p>1. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this contract, temporary<br/>teachers shall be entitled to receive the following leaves only:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental/Adoption Leave</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupational and Workers' Compensation Leave</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial Leave</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-Lieu Time</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Leave only to the extent required by State Law</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>j. Catastrophic Leave subject to the approval process provided in<br/>Section Q.</p>
<p>2. Temporary employees on paid leave:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall not be entitled to receive pay or benefits or return to a<br/>position after the term of the employment contract expires. This<br/>provision does not constitute a waiver of reemployment rights.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be entitled to receive fringe benefits to the extent not<br/>prohibited by law or other sections of this agreement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If rehired for another term shall receive credit for annual salary<br/>increments granted during leave except in cases of sick leave or<br/>part-time assignment where service is not rendered for 75% of<br/>the days in the teaching calendar.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be available only for participating<br/>member of the bank. The purpose of the Catastrophic Leave Bank is<br/>to provide paid leave to bargaining unit members who have experienced<br/>a catastrophic illness or injury either personally or within their family.<br/>A qualifying “catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness or injury<br/>that is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of<br/>time, or that incapacitates a member of the employee’s family, requiring<br/>the employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time<br/>to care for that family member. An employee’s industrial injury or<br/>industrial leave does not qualify as an illness or injury under this<br/>definition, provided the employee is eligible for coverage under Workers’<br/>Compensation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All new employees will automatically become members of the bank<br/>unless within 60 days of employment they notify the District in writing<br/>that they do not wish to join. Current bargaining unit members will be<br/>given the opportunity within 60 days of the adoption of this language<br/>to withdraw from membership in the bank. Thereafter everyone who<br/>wishes to continue to be eligible must participate in each subsequent<br/>contribution. Bargaining unit members may in writing opt out of<br/>coverage with 30 days following each subsequent requirement for<br/>contributions of one (1) additional sick day for the bank. When a<br/>member opts out he/she forfeits the right to request Catastrophic Leave<br/>benefits under this Section.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum of sixty days may be granted to a unit member when<br/>accrued paid sick leave is exhausted. This period is normally before<br/>the unit member has sought or qualified for “differential days.” All<br/>catastrophic leaves grants must be preceded by a written request<br/>describing the catastrophic illness or injury and how the bargaining</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>unit member qualifies for the Leave as defined in Paragraph I above.<br/>Initially the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources and the<br/>SLTA President shall evaluate act upon the request. If they are in<br/>agreement, their decision shall be final. In the event they are not in<br/>agreement after consideration of the request, the Association and the<br/>District shall appoint a mediator/arbitrator to facilitate an agreement.<br/>If such agreement is not forthcoming, the mediator/arbitrator shall<br/>make a final binding decision regarding the request for Catastrophic<br/>Leave. It is intended that this be done on an expedited basis.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member may apply for a second grant of Catastrophic<br/>Leave up to an additional sixty (60) days. This request can only be<br/>made after exhaustion of “differential days” and provided that the unit<br/>member is enrolled in an income protection plan providing for at least<br/>one (1) year salary protection. Such enrollment must have been in<br/>effect at the time of the incident resulting in the first request for<br/>Catastrophic Leave. This second Catastrophic Leave allocation can<br/>only be granted after the benefits from the income protection plan are<br/>exhausted.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President and the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources<br/>shall make their decision based on relative need and shall make<br/>reasonable efforts to preserve an adequate leave balance to cover future<br/>needs of the ban members. Current unit members will be covered by<br/>this contribution requirement unless they opt out in writing within<br/>thirty (30) days as provided above. Opting out will forfeit subsequent<br/>rights under this Section.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties under this Section shall comply with applicable<br/>confidentiality requirements.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If fewer than 60 days leave are contributed in any enrollment/donation<br/>period, the bank shall be dissolved and the current participants shall<br/>receive a pro-rata share of the banked days. The decision to seek an<br/>additional contribution of days shall occur whenever the bank has 60<br/>or fewer days or it is otherwise determined that the current bank of<br/>days is insufficient for expected claims as agreed by the District and<br/>the Association. The District shall annually provide the Association<br/>with the names of members participating and the total number of days<br/>remaining in the bank, as agreed by the District and the Association.</p>
<p>R. California Family Rights Act/Family and Medical Leave Act</p>
<p>1. The District shall comply with the applicable provisions of the<br/>California Family Rights Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act.<br/>Nothing herein shall be construed to delete any rights in the contract<br/>or the Education Code.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, the Acts permit unpaid leave for birth of a child, placement<br/>of a child for adoption or foster care, to care for a spouse, child or parent<br/>with a serious health condition, or a serious health condition which<br/>renders the employee unable to perform job functions.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions of child and parent shall be as defined in the above law.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any of the above leave reasons, the employer shall maintain the<br/>employee’s health benefits coverage on the same level as if the employee<br/>has continued to work to the extent required by the above referenced<br/>law. If an employee fails to return to work, an employer may recover<br/>its share of health plan premiums paid during the period of the unpaid<br/>leave unless the failure to return is caused by a serious health condition<br/>of the employee or other circumstance beyond the employee’s control.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XIV- TEACHER SAFETY</p>
<p>The parties are in agreement that safety of the bargaining unit members is a</p>
<p>priority.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the physical condition or behavior of a student is deemed a<br/>hazard to the safety of a teacher through disease or overt actions, the teacher<br/>may cause that student to be removed from class for the remainder of that<br/>day and the following day, sending the student to the principal for appropriate<br/>action. In the event of an assault or threat to a Bargaining Unit Member by<br/>a student or adult, the teacher shall report the incident to the principal<br/>immediately who will take appropriate action including a report of the<br/>incident to the police. The District shall inform teachers of conditions that<br/>are of imminent danger or hazardous to the full extent required by law.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall inform bargaining unit members of applicable laws<br/>concerning teacher and student safety. These laws will be discussed at the<br/>New Teacher Orientation each year. At a minimum, personal copies of key<br/>laws that deal with safety will be made available to teachers annually.<br/>Independently, Bargaining Unit Members acknowledge their obligation to<br/>comply with applicable laws.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will notify teachers of pupils who have been suspended or<br/>expelled for specified actions such as bodily harm, assault, sexual<br/>harassment, weapons on campus, hate crimes, extortion, or drugs as<br/>prescribed by law. Any information received by a teacher shall be received in<br/>confidence for the limited purpose for which it was provided and shall not be<br/>further disseminated to the extent required by law.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide protective devices where they are specifically<br/>required by Cal/OSHA, for the safety of the Bargaining Unit Members.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall maintain a program to assess and correct any unsafe<br/>physical conditions which exist within the buildings or on the property of the<br/>school district.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Bargaining Unit Members will report any unsafe conditions which<br/>they observe to the principal in writing. The principal will cause an<br/>assessment of the reported condition to be made and advise the<br/>Member of the results of that assessment and any proposed action.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal of each school, all Bargaining Unit Members and the<br/>Superintendent's Office shall work cooperatively to assure compliance<br/>with the safety conditions as mandated by Cal/OSHA guidelines.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>3. A unit member or school site safety committee shall report promptly in<br/>writing to the immediate supervisor any unhealthy or unsafe facilities,<br/>conditions, or equipment. The administrator shall respond<br/>appropriately to the report. If the unit member or committee is not<br/>satisfied with the administrator’s disposition of the issue, either may<br/>appeal the problem in writing to the superintendent or designee for<br/>further considerations and action. The determination of the matter by<br/>the superintendent or designee shall be reported to the unit member or<br/>committee as soon as possible but not more than five (5) days after<br/>receipt of the appeal. The unit member or committee may request a<br/>response in writing.</p>
<p>The District shall explore equipping and maintaining a working electronic<br/>device for verbal communication in each classroom, or in the case of P.E., on<br/>every instructor, for communication purposes between each classroom and<br/>the school office consistent with the established emergency procedure plan<br/>developed at each school. A report on the feasibility and implementation of<br/>the above shall be done not later than October 31, 1994.</p>
<p>F. When unauthorized persons are observed on school premises, they shall be<br/>reported to the administrator or designee, who shall investigate the report;<br/>and if appropriate, ask that the person leave, and if necessary, call the Police<br/>Department.</p>
<p>1. To ensure the safety of SLTA members, the Human Resources<br/>Department will oversee the training of site personnel in the<br/>implementation and enforcement of the SLUSD Visitor’s Policy by<br/>September 15 of each year, and, provide evidence to SLTA by October<br/>1.</p>

<p>Member who holds a Master's degree, 1-1/2% of Column III/13<br/>or, each Bargaining Unit Member who holds a Doctor's degree, 2-<br/>1 /2% of Column III/13.</p>
<p>c. Professional Growth</p>
<p>Bargaining Unit Members who have attained BA plus 60 units<br/>and who have been for at least one year on Step 10 of Class III<br/>shall be entitled to a professional growth allowance. A maximum<br/>of 10 semester units may be credited in any one year.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1976-77 school year credit for PGI courses will<br/>be allowed if transcripts with rationale are submitted to the<br/>Human Resources Office by October 31. This will apply to<br/>courses, which were completed after November 1, 1975. During<br/>the two-week period following October 31, a committee will review<br/>all such submissions and will forward to the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Human Resources courses recommended for<br/>credit. Individuals whose courses are disapproved on the<br/>grounds that there is only indirect evidence of their relation to<br/>the assignment of the Bargaining Unit Member shall be given the<br/>opportunity to appear before the committee and present their<br/>cases.</p>
<p>Professional growth units earned after June 4, 1993, will be<br/>considered for credit if verification is submitted to the Human<br/>Resources Office by October 31. During the two-week period<br/>following October 31, a committee will meet to review all<br/>submissions challenged by the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Human Resources and will forward to the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Human Resources courses recommended for<br/>credit. Individuals whose courses are disapproved on the<br/>grounds that there is only indirect evidence of their relation to<br/>the assignment of the Bargaining Unit Member should be given<br/>the opportunity to appear before the Committee and present their<br/>cases.</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining Unit Members holding a degree based on four (4)<br/>years of college training and a California credential will be<br/>allowed full credit for outside teaching experience up to ten (10)<br/>years, provided said K-12 experience is in public schools or in an<br/>accredited private school requiring a California teaching<br/>credential.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only full years of experience will count toward placement on the<br/>schedule. A full year is 75% of the full number of days in a<br/>regular school year. Leaves of absence do not count as years of<br/>experience, unless spent in overseas or exchange teaching or on<br/>sabbatical. (See exception in Job Sharing Article)</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for training will be allowed either from accredited<br/>universities and colleges or from in-service courses, which have<br/>been approved by the administration. Hours from these<br/>professional growth activities will be converted to regular<br/>university semester unit equivalents for salary schedule<br/>purposes.</p>
<p>In-service courses are offered by the school district, and credit<br/>for these will qualify personnel for salary advancement under the<br/>following conditions:</p>

<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary credit will be limited to a maximum of six units for<br/>each fifteen required for a given salary classification.</p>
<p>(iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior approval is required for in-service courses for which<br/>college or university credit is not granted.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semester units (or quarter unit equivalents) from accredited<br/>colleges and universities only will be recognized for salary<br/>schedule credit. Repetitive courses are subject to limitation for<br/>credit for salary schedule advancement. Prior approval of such<br/>possible courses should be obtained from the Superintendent's<br/>Office.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) years of military experience will be allowed on the salary<br/>schedule. Maximum credit for both military and teaching<br/>experience shall not exceed ten (10) years.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Bargaining Unit Member completes further training during a<br/>summer period that would qualify for an increase in salary, such<br/>credit shall be allowed, provided a statement of such is received<br/>from the institution by October 31<sup>st</sup> of that school year.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time home instructors will be paid according to the regular<br/>schedule for Bargaining Unit Members. Part-time or substitute<br/>home instructors will be paid on the Adult School schedule for<br/>time spent in actual instruction.</p>

Four (4) periods of special<br/>teaching are required on the secondary level to qualify for the<br/>stipend.

<p>Teachers of mentally retarded and educationally handicapped<br/>classes will receive a stipend equal to 6.5 percent of their Class<br/>placement at the highest Step for that Class up to Column III,<br/>Step 13. Teachers of disability classes will receive a stipend equal<br/>to 3.25 percent of their Class placement at the highest step for<br/>that Class up to Column III, Step 13. Teachers on the secondary<br/>level must teach a minimum of four (4) special periods to qualify<br/>for the stipend. Lesser assignments will be based on one-fourth<br/>(1/4) of the amount per period taught.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Librarians will be paid according to the regular schedule for<br/>Bargaining Unit Members.</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel in authorized curriculum writing projects will be paid<br/>at the District hourly rate.</p>

<p>(a) Stipends: All stipends provided for in the Collective<br/>Bargaining Agreement shall remain at 2006-07<br/>levels until July 1, 2009. The parties recognize that<br/>AP Stipends were originally negotiated to be a single<br/>stipend per teacher, not per course. Past practice<br/>has applied these stipends per course. This practice<br/>shall be continued for 2007-8. Commencing with<br/>the 2008-09 school year AP stipends shall apply per<br/>preparation provided significant variations in<br/>preparations are required. For example, one AP<br/>Stipend shall be paid per teacher for a single foreign<br/>language or subject matter.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>The parties agree that stipends and stipend amounts<br/>should be reviewed, prior the 2009-10 negotiations<br/>a Joint Stipend Committee shall be formed by the<br/>District and the Association to provide information,<br/>analysis, and recommendations regarding District<br/>Stipends and comparisons with other districts that<br/>can form the basis for negotiations.</p>
<p>A designated Teacher-In-Charge shall receive<br/>his/her regular salary plus a 6.5% stipend based on<br/>Step 13 of Column I, II, or III depending on the Unit<br/>Member's column salary placement.

<p>The Teacher In charge at Bancroft, Muir, and Wilson<br/>will be compensated at 2% of Step 13, Column I, II,<br/>or III depending on the Unit member’s column salary<br/>placement. A Unit Member placed beyond Column<br/>III shall receive the 2% stipend based on Column III,<br/>Step 13.</p>
<p>A BCLAD certified Unit Member teaching in a BCLAD<br/>assignment shall receive his/her regular salary plus<br/>a 6.5% stipend based on Step 13 of Column I, II, or<br/>III depending on the Unit Member's column salary<br/>placement. A Unit Member placed beyond Column<br/>III, shall receive the 6.5% stipend based on Column<br/>III, Step 13. Five periods of special teaching are<br/>required on the secondary level to qualify for the<br/>stipend. Teachers with the BCLAD who teach these<br/>classes fewer than five periods will be paid at the rate<br/>of one-fifth the additional stipend multiplied by the<br/>number of periods taught. Elementary teachers<br/>must teach classes requiring the BCLAD on a full¬<br/>time basis to receive the stipend.</p>
<p>A BCLAD certified Unit Member who is not otherwise<br/>receiving a BCLAD stipend under this section may<br/>qualify for an extra-duty assignment. The extra-duty<br/>assignment and description shall be developed in<br/>consultation with the Association. The quantity of<br/>services required shall be reasonably related to the<br/>economic value of this stipend. No Unit Member<br/>shall be required to take such an assignment.</p>
<p>The District shall reimburse teachers for the cost of<br/>one successfully taken LDS/CLAD examination</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>provided they were employees of the District at the<br/>time the examination was taken from the date of<br/>employment through July 1, 1995.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on special Assignment shall receive<br/>additional per-diem compensation at a daily rate if<br/>required to work during non-duty days.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing hourly District pay rate or an<br/>equivalent lump sum payment will be paid to unit<br/>members who perform additional, pre-approved<br/>work that is not included on the additional<br/>compensation schedule. (Article 15, Section 17).<br/>Any exceptions to this will be reviewed with and<br/>agreed to by the Association and District.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hourly rate shall be $32.50. This rate shall be<br/>used as a basis to initially establish stipends for new<br/>positions or new appointments to existing positions<br/>unless another stipend amount has been previously<br/>negotiated. Continuing stipend amounts shall be<br/>determined through the negotiations process as is<br/>legally appropriate. Nothing in this provision shall<br/>prevent the Association and the District from<br/>negotiating stipends reflecting special conditions<br/>such as limited funding.</p>
<p>(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New teachers will receive a stipend for attending<br/>“New Teacher Day Orientation”, equivalent to<br/>current substitute daily rate.</p>
<p>Continuation of this project will be contingent upon<br/>successful evaluation of the program and finding<br/>funding sources outside the general fund.</p>
<p>Education Services, PAR and SLTA will be<br/>responsible for planning the day.</p>
<p>r. School Psychologists, Behavior Specialists and Program<br/>Specialists will be placed on Class III of the Bargaining Unit<br/>Member's salary schedule, and will receive an additional stipend<br/>equal to 9.75 percent of Class III, Step 13.

<p>71</p>
<p>s.</p>
<p>Employee Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>(i) Dental insurance required for employees and available for<br/>dependents if a group qualifies.</p>
<p>t. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and SLTA agree that domestic partners shall be<br/>included under this article effective January 1, 1998. The<br/>procedures for application, enrollment criteria, duration, and<br/>other appropriate provisions are specified in Appendix F of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>u. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District in conjunction with the Association may offer an IRC<br/>Section 125 base plan for Bargaining Unit Members.</p>
<p>v. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired Certificated Personnel Health Insurance</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employees who retire on or after July 1, 1984, from<br/>district employment at age 55 and have twenty (20)<br/>consecutive years of service in the District or the sum of<br/>any age above 55 years of age and consecutive years of<br/>service in the District which equals 75, the District will pay<br/>the employee only health premium in effect at the time of<br/>retirement. A Board-approved leave shall constitute a year<br/>of service for the purpose of eligibility for this benefit.<br/>Dental insurance is not included in this provision. Benefits<br/>under this provision will be integrated with Medicare and<br/>Medi-Cal benefits.</p>
<p>Employees 50 years old or above who qualify for disability<br/>retirement and otherwise meet the above requirements<br/>(except age) shall be eligible for this benefit.</p>
<p>Bargaining Unit Members who are retired from the District<br/>and have maintained health/dental coverage through a<br/>spouse continuing to work in the District, shall have the<br/>right to return to the district Retiree Health Insurance<br/>Program once his/her spouse retires, dies and/or leaves<br/>the District, subject to carrier requirements. The dollar<br/>amount for the retiree under the Retiree Medical Plan shall<br/>be the amount in effect at the time of his/her original<br/>retirement from the District.</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons hired on or after July 1, 1984, are not eligible to<br/>participate in any retiree health benefit program.</p>
<p>(iii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined District-paid premium of those eligible<br/>former Unit Members who retired prior to July 1, 1984,<br/>shall not exceed $108,000 for purposes of this calculation,</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>and shall be diminished by the July 1, 1984, District-paid<br/>premium costs of any of those retirees for whom premiums<br/>are no longer being paid. (Amount A)</p>
<p>The District-paid premium costs attributable to eligible<br/>former members who retire subsequent to June 30, 1984,<br/>shall be added to Amount A (above). When this combined<br/>amount exceeds $210,000, the excess shall be divided by<br/>the total number of qualified former unit members who are<br/>retired and for whom the District is still making premium<br/>payments. The District shall pay this prorated amount for<br/>each former Unit Member who retired prior to July 1, 1984,<br/>and for whom the District is still making premium<br/>payments. The remainder shall be prorated and charged<br/>equally to each former Unit Member who retired<br/>subsequent to June 30, 1984.</p>
<p>(iv) It is the intent of the parties that the 1985 court settlement<br/>with pre-July 1, 1984, retirees regarding district payment<br/>of medical insurance premiums not encroach upon the<br/>monies set aside for post July 1, 1984, retiree fringe<br/>benefits in the 1983-86 agreement (Article XV, Section 22).<br/>The language of this section shall be interpreted in<br/>compliance with this intent.</p>
<p>w. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longevity</p>
<p>A longevity increment will be paid at the 17th, 21st, and 25th<br/>step of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>Only full years of experience will count toward the longevity<br/>increment. A full year is 75% of the full number of days in a<br/>regular school year. Leaves of absence do not count as years of<br/>experience unless spent overseas or exchange teaching or on<br/>sabbatical. (See exception in Job Sharing Article)</p>
<p>x. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death Benefit</p>
<p>In the event a Bargaining Unit Member dies during the school<br/>year and has received salary payments beyond the pro rata<br/>entitlement, such excess funds shall be regarded as a death<br/>benefit and part of the member's fringe benefit package. This<br/>benefit cannot exceed twenty (20) percent of the Bargaining Unit<br/>Member's compensation and shall be considered void if in<br/>violation of any applicable legal restriction.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>y-</p>
<p>Spousal Death Benefits</p>
<p>Current Bargaining Unit Members who are covered by a District<br/>medical plan and have included a spouse under such coverage<br/>shall be eligible for a spousal death benefit. Consistent with<br/>carrier requirements, restrictions or prohibitions, the District<br/>shall allow the surviving spouse the right to continue medical<br/>coverage at the spouse's expense. The intent of this provision is<br/>to extend the surviving spouse's COBRA rights beyond the<br/>current thirty-six (36) month limit.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XX - SCHOOL CALENDAR</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the teachers' work year for the 1998-99 school year shall be 186<br/>work days of which 180 days shall be teaching days. The work days shall<br/>increase to 187 days in 1999-2000 of which 180 shall be teaching days. The<br/>total salary schedule adjustment for these additional workdays is reflected in<br/>the 1998-99 salary schedule. Workdays beyond 184 are specifically funded<br/>as staff development days (E.C. 52120-52128.5). Should this funding become<br/>unavailable for any reason the required workdays and corresponding increase<br/>in salary shall be readjusted downward to offset the lost funding. Such an<br/>adjustment shall immediately reopen this Agreement for negotiations. This<br/>funding has been used to increase the 1998-99 salary schedule by 1.10%<br/>(.39% was added to the 1997-98 salary schedule).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District will meet prior to June 1<sup>st</sup> to reach agreement<br/>on a calendar for the next year not covered by contractual agreement. Said<br/>calendar shall be incorporated into the Contract.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to attempt to continue to coordinate the calendars with the<br/>Hayward, Castro Valley, and San Lorenzo school districts and their<br/>Associations. Following such efforts, the parties will continue negotiations<br/>on the calendar independently from the other provisions of the tentative<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the District nor school sites will require attendance for meetings<br/>before the Unit member's first duty day. Unit members who receive<br/>compensation for extra duty days could be required to meet before the first<br/>duty day.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff Development and Common Planning Advisory Committee: The parties<br/>agree to form a committee for the purpose of exploring, examining and<br/>potentially making recommendations regarding staff development and<br/>common planning activities. This will include reviewing the need and<br/>opportunity for teachers to meet across the district by grade level groupings,<br/>discuss content areas across grade levels, and understand what prior grade<br/>and next grade levels are studying. The committee may explore the best<br/>methods of providing needed staff development information and programs.<br/>Additionally the committee may evaluate the effectiveness of various<br/>programs and make recommendations on how staff development and<br/>common planning time is best used in the District, including whether one or<br/>more staff development days could be divided into half day sessions and<br/>potentially paired with planning activities. Any recommendation of the<br/>Committee shall be provided to the Association and the District for use in<br/>negotiating future or modified calendars. Any calendar change through this<br/>process would require agreement of the Association and the District.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude a 6/5th assignment provided the<br/>additional assignment is acceptable to the Bargaining Unit Member.

<p>ARTICLE XXHI - COMPLAINTS CONCERNING SCHOOL PERSONNEL</p>
<p>The governing board places trust in its employees and desires to support their<br/>actions in such manner that employees are freed from unnecessary or unfounded<br/>criticism and complaints. Unit members are encouraged to resolve complaints<br/>informally and every effort should be made to resolve the complaint at the earliest<br/>possible stage.</p>
<p>The following steps shall be followed for complaints covered by this Article:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints concerning school personnel should be made directly by the<br/>complainant to the person against whom the complaint is lodged. Upon<br/>request of the employee, the administrator shall be present at any initial<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint is not resolved at this level, the complainant is requested to<br/>put the complaint into writing and to direct it to the employee's<br/>administrative supervisor, or principal. The District shall supply a copy to<br/>the employee within five (5) days of receipt.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the supervisor shall attempt to schedule a meeting between the<br/>complainant, employee and supervisor. If the complaint, after review by the<br/>supervisor, remains unresolved, the supervisor shall refer the written<br/>complaint, together with the supervisor's report and analysis of the situation,<br/>to the Superintendent or his designee, with a copy to the employee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee may send a response to the Superintendent within five (5) days<br/>of receipt of the supervisor's report.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent's decision shall be final unless the complainant, the<br/>employee, or the Superintendent requests a closed hearing before the<br/>governing board on the complaint. If the employee so requests, an open<br/>hearing will be held.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hearing, either open or closed, will be held by the governing board on any<br/>complaint unless and until the board has received the Superintendent's<br/>written report concerning the complaint. The Superintendent's report shall<br/>contain, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of each employee involved.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summary of the nature of the complaint and<br/>the facts surrounding it, sufficient to inform the Governing Board<br/>and the employee(s) as to precise nature of the complaint and to<br/>allow employee(s) to prepare a defense.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A true copy of the signed original of the complaint itself.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Board shall be final. However, nothing shall<br/>preclude the employee from filing a grievance alleging a violation<br/>or misinterpretation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Failure of the complainant to put the complaint into written form will be considered<br/>by the District as a dropping of the complaint, and no record shall be placed in the<br/>employee's file.</p>
<p>After a written complaint is received by the District, the employee and/or the<br/>complainant may have a conferee or other representation.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>This Article does not apply to one Bargaining Unit Member filing a complaint against<br/>another Bargaining Unit Member.</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that complaints against unit members,<br/>whether written or verbal, that include allegations of violations of state or federal<br/>law are not subject to procedures, limitations or requirements set forth in Article<br/>XXIII of the parties; CBA. In such cases, the District may address and act in<br/>response to such complaints entirely independent of Article XXIII, and such matters<br/>shall not be grievable. Within 10 days (as defined in CBA, Article V Section A.3) of<br/>receipt of such a complaint, unless otherwise required by law, the District will notify<br/>the Association and the unit member, in writing, as to the existence of the complaint<br/>and a brief summary of the alleged violations of state or federal law.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>This bilateral Agreement as signed by the parties represents the complete<br/>understanding between them. District practices and policies are limited only by the<br/>express provisions of this Agreement and by State law. Any said practices or policies<br/>that are found to be in conflict with this Agreement shall be null and void.</p>

<p>It is the intent of the Board of Education of the San Leandro Unified School District<br/>to maintain a Mentor Teacher Program. The program shall meet the requirements<br/>specified in SB813 and any subsequent legislation so that the District may qualify<br/>for any and all state funding required to establish and maintain this program.

<p>of teachers nominated will be 25% more than the number allowed by<br/>law whenever possible.</p>
<p>5. Initial selection as a mentor teacher by the Board of Education shall be<br/>for a term of two years. A mentor teacher may request an extended term<br/>of one additional year subject to the nominating committee’s review of<br/>the mentor teacher’s performance during the term of service.

<p>103</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each mentor assignment shall be evaluated annually. Successful<br/>evaluation shall be considered a prerequisite for reappointment to a<br/>third year of mentorship.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Educational Services Office will make an annual report to the<br/>Board of Education on the effectiveness of the mentor teacher program.</p>
<p>This program will be operative only with special funding so designated by the state<br/>and with board approval. The final decision for selection of mentor teachers rests<br/>with the Board of Education. Either the Board of Education or the mentor teacher<br/>may terminate the individual mentor teacher assignment for cause at any time after<br/>initial appointment.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIX - RESTRUCTURING</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The parties agree that it is in their best interest to cooperatively engage in the<br/>exploration of educational reform proposals relating to school restructuring.</p>
<p>Concept</p>
<p>This venture may call for a variety of changing roles and responsibilities<br/>within the schools, including but not necessarily limited to:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involving school staff members in decision making at sites through<br/>respecting and seeking divergent point of views.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devising new systems of school site accountability.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing and valuing individual differences and the uniqueness of<br/>each school site.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizing and staffing schools in new ways.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altering schedules and learning activities to accommodate different<br/>levels of student learning.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involving school staff members in site level budget development.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Recognizing that restructuring may require collective bargaining flexibility on<br/>a continuing basis, the District and Association adopt the following guidelines<br/>to assist in the implementation of a committee:</p>
<p>1. The District and the Association recognize the need for the following in<br/>any restructuring effort:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider waivers to Education Code or District Policies</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modify contract provisions</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form a District restructuring committee</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue two-way on-going collaborative conversations</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assist in educating district employees (i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site-based decision</p>
<p>making, conflict resolution, consensus building, current<br/>research, etc.)</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disseminate information</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support on-going staff development</p>
<p>2. Sites that develop restructuring or reform proposals which involve<br/>waivers to the collective bargaining agreement shall submit a written<br/>request for waiver to the District Restructuring Committee. The request<br/>shall include the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the restructuring/reform proposal(s) or a copy of<br/>the plan including the rationale for the change.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification by the principal that:</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he/she recommends the plan, the contract waivers being<br/>sought, and the time period for which those waivers are<br/>sought;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the school site council has reviewed and approved the<br/>proposal(s) and the contract waivers sought;</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by consensus as defined by the site or at least 67% of the<br/>staff at the school site have approved, by secret ballot, the<br/>proposal(s) and the contract waivers sought.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All agreements to change contract provisions will be made by formal<br/>written agreement of the parties. Each party will determine its own<br/>procedures for ratifying any written agreement which modifies existing<br/>contract provisions. The Board of Education will be advised of and<br/>review any contract, Education Code, or District Policy waiver before it<br/>is recommended for approval.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and Association agree to establish a District Restructuring<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>D. District Restructuring Committee</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership:</p>

This<br/>District Restructuring Committee shall have authority to work<br/>with staff in implementing the policies established by the Board<br/>in those areas which fall within the guidelines noted in Section</p>
<p>C.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Restructuring Committee shall serve in an advisory</p>
<p>capacity on issues dealing with modifying or orienting policy.</p>
<p>108</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXX - YEAR ROUND SCHOOL (YRS)</p>
<p>A. Work Year</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year shall be 186 equivalent days with 180 student contact<br/>days (ADA days).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calendar shall be proposed by the year-round staff utilizing, where<br/>possible, the break periods within the traditional school year. The<br/>proposed calendar shall be reviewed by the bargaining teams for<br/>approval. Final approval will be given by the Association and the Board<br/>of Education.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early dismissals (1:50 p.m.) will be authorized at the end of each of the<br/>three teaching blocks for schools on a year round calendar.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall not be required to attend in-services or meetings during<br/>their off-track time in a manner similar to summer vacation.</p>
<p>B. Work Day</p>
<p>1. The length of the day shall be equivalent to the teacher and student<br/>work-day of the traditional school calendar.</p>
<p>C. Transfer</p>
<p>1. Initial transfer conditions during the conversion year shall be as set</p>
<p>forth below:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on site shall have preferential assignment rights in a<br/>school changing from traditional to a YRS.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers wanting to transfer out of a year-round school shall<br/>have priority for any District openings for which they are qualified<br/>under the transfer article.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers within the year-round school shall be given priority for<br/>available assignments to other grade levels within the school<br/>prior to being transferred out of a school due to a year round<br/>calendar.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the openings are determined at a YRS, then postings for<br/>each open grade level shall be done by the District for a minimum<br/>of 5 days.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should it become necessary to transfer a teacher from a YRS to<br/>a traditional calendar school due to YRS requirements, the</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>District will first ask for volunteers to transfer. A teacher who<br/>volunteers to transfer shall be given first consideration for the<br/>transfer. If no one volunteers, the least senior qualified teacher<br/>will be transferred.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher is involved in a transfer that would ordinarily involve<br/>a change in pay cycle, the teacher may remain on his/her pay<br/>cycle.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall not be required to transfer from a traditional<br/>school to a YRS unless there are no vacancies in a traditional<br/>school and the only vacancy is at a year round school.</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher to be transferred may accept the YRS vacancy<br/>or elect to replace the least senior qualified teacher who<br/>shall be required to accept the YRS vacancy.</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher transferred under this provision shall have the<br/>option of transferring to a vacancy in a traditional calendar<br/>school at the beginning of the following school year<br/>provided the teacher is qualified for the vacant position.<br/>Nothing in this section shall prevent an earlier transfer<br/>consistent with the transfer article of this agreement.</p>
<p>2. Transfer procedures following the year of the conversion shall be as<br/>provided by the contract unless otherwise changed by the parties<br/>through subsequent negotiations regarding YRS issues.</p>
<p>D. Substituting</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers off-track shall have a priority to substitute within the District.<br/>The District long-term substitute rate plus $20.00 per day shall be paid<br/>for day-to-day service. Teachers working a traditional calendar shall<br/>have the opportunity to substitute for YRS teachers. Staff shall be<br/>required to indicate their availability, in writing, to the Human<br/>Resources Office to receive priority under this section.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association shall explore the workability and<br/>legality of allowing teachers from traditional calendar schools and YRS<br/>to replace each other on a day to day basis at no additional cost to the<br/>District. Any agreement shall require the approval of the Association<br/>and the Board.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>E. Leaves</p>
<p>Teachers may be eligible for unpaid leaves consistent with the leave policy of<br/>the District. Leave requests must be submitted at least four (4) weeks prior<br/>to the first day of leave.</p>
<p>F. Maintenance of Benefits</p>
<p>Teachers on YRS are to receive the equivalent benefits to teachers in a<br/>traditional calendar school. The District shall make every reasonable effort<br/>to assure that YRS teachers shall not be disenfranchised in any district<br/>elections, surveys, or questionnaires.</p>
<p>G. Auxiliary Personnel</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses, resource specialists, music teachers, speech therapists,<br/>adaptive P.E. teachers, and any other specialists may extend their work<br/>year if mutually agreed between the employee and the District. Any<br/>extensions of the 184 day work year shall result in a pro-rata increase<br/>in salaries for the additional contract work days excluding inter¬<br/>sessions which are subject to summer school conditions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall be credited with one additional illness leave day for each<br/>eighteen (18) additional days worked beyond the 184 day work year<br/>excluding substitute work or intersession days subject to summer<br/>school conditions. The four (4) teacher work-days beyond the 180<br/>student days shall be counted toward the first 18 days increment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional calendar schools and YRS shall have equivalent access to<br/>specialists based on student needs and/or enrollment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extended salary schedule consistent with Education Code 37632<br/>shall be based on the base salary schedules noted in Appendix C. The<br/>extended salaries for 190 or 200 days of service will be based on the<br/>Unit Member's daily rate.</p>
<p>H. Termination of Year-Round School</p>
<p>If the District adopts and implements a YRS program and then later decides<br/>to eliminate part or all of such program, it shall give reasonable prior notice<br/>to the SLTA.</p>
<p>I. Class Size</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils shall be distributed equitably among teachers assigned to the<br/>same grade level.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class sizes shall be in accordance with the Contract. The parties agree<br/>that the average class size for the District as a whole and YRS should<br/>be the same. To reach this goal, the District agrees to staff YRS at the</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>prior year's District average by the 11th school day of the first trimester.<br/>However, this article shall not be violated unless the maximum or<br/>average class size exceeds that established by the contract.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise stated, all provisions of this contract are intended to apply<br/>to year-round Unit Members.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article shall be discussed at the request of either party for the next two<br/>years due to the newness of this concept in the District. Contract language<br/>may be changed after one year or as otherwise mutually agreed. Should the<br/>District decide to open any multi-track &quot;yrs&quot; program, then new bargaining<br/>shall commence dealing with the new issues of multi-track &quot;yrs&quot;.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inter-sessions:</p>
<p>Nothing in this agreement is intended to prevent the application of summer<br/>session conditions to inter-sessions. For example, a teacher would not be<br/>required to teach inter-sessions, and the intersession rate is the summer<br/>school hourly rate.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXXI - AM/PM KINDERGARTEN</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AM/PM kindergarten site schedules are required to meet legal mandates for<br/>full funding and comply with applicable provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AM/PM Sections will be paired. If only one section is available it shall be<br/>configured using a staggered schedule. When it is determined that a<br/>kindergarten teaching assignment exists which will not be shared, the unit<br/>member at the site currently teaching kindergarten with the greatest District<br/>seniority shall choose whether to accept this assignment. If the position is<br/>declined, then the opportunity shall be offered to the next most senior<br/>kindergarten teacher at that site until the position is filled or is assigned to<br/>the least senior kindergarten teacher at that site. In subsequent years, the<br/>assignment will be rotated by seniority unless otherwise determined by the<br/>affected unit members at the site. A solo teacher that has previously taught<br/>a solo kindergarten assignment will not be eligible for the same assignment<br/>until all other kindergarten teachers at the site have either served or waived<br/>the assignment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paired kindergarten teachers shall determine who receives which assignment<br/>by agreement. Should agreement not be reached, then the kindergarten<br/>teacher with the greatest seniority in the District shall in the first year choose.<br/>Thereafter, the assignment will rotate unless otherwise agreed.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten teachers are encouraged to choose partners subject to<br/>consultation and final approval by the site administrator. If a partner is not<br/>selected, any affected unit member will be given the opportunity to provide<br/>input into the interview and selection process consistent with the need to<br/>make necessary assignments.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each partnership’s effectiveness is dependent upon the establishment of a<br/>cooperative working relationship. In the event a disagreement occurs which<br/>allegedly violates a provision of this Agreement, the Grievance Procedures<br/>under Article V are available. If the disagreement of dispute does not<br/>necessarily involve violation of a contract provision and the kindergarten<br/>teachers are having difficulty in resolving the matter, both parties should<br/>attempt to reach a mutually agreed upon resolution of the issue with the site<br/>administrator. In addition, or alternatively, use may be made of a District-<br/>appointed facilitator. If either kindergarten teacher is unaccepting of the<br/>resolution, it may be appealed within five working days to the Superintendent<br/>of designee. This resolution shall be final subject to the rights of the<br/>Association under this Agreement and the review authority of the Board.</p>

<p>The 1992-93 negotiated changes to Article IV, Section C, are not intended to modify<br/>past practices or reduce the Association's ability to communicate with Unit<br/>Members.

<p>APPENDIX K- SCHEDULING ELEMENTARY TEACHERS’ PREP. PERIODS</p>
<p>It is recognized that with the current staffing, it is not possible to schedule for every<br/>elementary teacher only one of the negotiated 45-minute preparation periods on<br/>each of four separate workdays. Some teachers must take two prep periods on the<br/>same day, which results in none on another day. Because this creates a hardship<br/>on those teachers, the District will utilize the following guidelines in scheduling<br/>preparation times for elementary teachers:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No teacher will have two 45-minute prep periods on the weekly<br/>unstaggered, early dismissal day (currently Wednesday).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No teacher will be given more than one &quot;double prep&quot;.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Double preps&quot; will be scheduled adjacently or &quot;back-to-back&quot;.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no yard duty assigned to a teacher on a day when that<br/>teacher has no prep time at all.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Double preps&quot; will be rotated each year so that no teacher has to<br/>double up for more than one school year until the other teachers on the<br/>staff have done so.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests will be honored from teachers who volunteer to take &quot;double<br/>preps&quot; before they are assigned to teachers who do not want them.</p>
<p>Representatives for the District and SLTA will meet previous to the 1996-97 school<br/>year to review this agreement and the success of these guidelines. (9/95)</p>

<p>APPENDIX L - PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW PROGRAM</p>
<p>The District and the Association hereby establish, a teacher peer assistance and<br/>review program (PAR), making available the skills of exemplary teachers to help all<br/>teachers develop as professionals. PAR shall use as its professional model the<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP). The peer assistance<br/>program will be provided non-permanent teachers through the BTSA program,<br/>augmented as necessary with funds from PAR. Peer assistance and review will be<br/>provided to permanent teachers who volunteer for assistance or who are referred to<br/>the program because of an unsatisfactory evaluation.</p>
<p>Between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000, the District shall notify the State<br/>Superintendent of Schools that it plans to implement the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Program pursuant to ABX11 on July 1, 2000.

The PAR<br/>program for Beginning Teachers shall include the BTSA program. BTSA<br/>shall be supplemented with PAR funds as necessary to insure that<br/>Beginning Teachers who are not eligible for BTSA funding or do not<br/>wish to participate in BTSA are provided the support deemed<br/>appropriate by the JC. All support provided the Beginning Teacher<br/>shall be confidential in accord with BTSA program guidelines. The<br/>District shall provide the JC and BTSA with a list of all Beginning<br/>Teachers at the beginning of every school year, indicating the support<br/>program for which the Beginning Teacher is eligible, and shall<br/>supplement the list during the year as required.</p>
<p>B. Referred Teachers (RT)</p>
<p>Permanent unit members who have received an unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation shall be referred to the JC and required to participate in the<br/>PAR program as an intervention.</p>

<p>Sideletter Peer Assistance and Review Program (2003-2004) Modification: During<br/>the 2003-2004 a reduction in funding occurred needing adjustments to guarantee<br/>that the Program does not encroach on the General Fund. The proposed budget<br/>submitted to the San Leandro Board of Education by the Joint Committee (JC)<br/>shall be balanced and not encroach on the General Fund. In 2003-2004 carryover<br/>funding from prior years will delay major program and other reductions until the<br/>2004-2005 school year (assuming that funding remains greatly reduced.</p>
<p>For the 2003-2004 school year the annual stipend for the Association appointees to<br/>the JC shall be $4,875. The parties agree to meet and negotiate the stipends for<br/>the 2004-2005 as soon as possible after the funding for the 2004-2005 school year<br/>is determined. It is intended that the 2004-2005 stipend will be agreed upon within<br/>30 days of the State adoption of the 2004-2005 budget. The stipend for the<br/>Association appointees to the JC shall be established by written or verbal tentative<br/>agreement before the first JC meeting of the 2004-2005 school year. Due to the<br/>expected significant funding reduction for 2004-2005, the JC shall not meet until<br/>the new stipends are agreed upon between representatives of the Association and<br/>the District. Additionally, the Association and the District shall negotiate and<br/>establish the stipends for Support Providers and Site Coordinators. Subsequently,<br/>if the JC determines that the stipends are not consistent with the budget or<br/>otherwise unacceptable, it can make recommendations on changes to the<br/>Association and the District for reconsideration.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to Regular Assignment</p>
<p>While on assignment as a full time consulting teacher, the CT will be<br/>considered on leave to a categorical program from his/her regular<br/>position shall be subject to the return rights of a CT for a 2 year period<br/>and these return rights shall be noted if the position is posted. These<br/>return rights allow a CT to return to his/her previous position if the<br/>previous position is available. If the position still exists, it shall be<br/>considered available regardless of the status of the incumbent. Should<br/>the CT accept a 3<sup>rd</sup> year assignment out of the classroom, the CT forfeits<br/>the right to return to his/her previous position.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caseload</p>
<p>The JC shall determine the caseload for a consulting teacher. The<br/>number is dependent on the amount of intervention time which the JC<br/>determines, in consultation with the CT, is necessary for each<br/>participating teacher. Consulting Teachers shall assist the teachers on<br/>their caseload by demonstrating, observing, coaching, conferencing,<br/>referring or by other activities, which, in their professional judgment,<br/>will assist the teacher in accord with the PAR process set out below in<br/>Section IV.</p>

Thereafter, the Consulting<br/>Teacher shall meet with the RT/VT and the site principal together or<br/>separately, as appropriate, to review the employee’s performance and<br/>recommendations for improvement. The Consulting Teacher will then<br/>prepare a written Assistance Plan aimed at remedying the deficiencies<br/>which were cited in the RT’s unsatisfactory evaluation or meeting the<br/>goals set forth in the VT’s application. For the RT, it will include 1)<br/>performance goals which are aligned with pupil learning and consistent<br/>with Stull Bill criteria and CSTP and 2) a projected date for completion<br/>which will ordinarily be at the end of the current school year. The Plan<br/>will be submitted to the JC for final development and approval.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom Observations</p>
<p>The Assistance Plan will include multiple observations of the RT/FT by<br/>the Consulting Teacher. These observations will be in addition to any<br/>that are performed as part of the evaluation Article in this agreement.</p>

The Consulting Teacher’s report shall<br/>include an assessment as to whether the Assistance Plan can be<br/>discontinued, whether the Plan needs revision, or whether the Plan<br/>needs to be extended beyond its original projected term. For purposes<br/>of the VT these reports shall be limited to the assistance log referred to<br/>in II.C. above.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>D. Final Report</p>
<p>By May 1, or at a later date if specified in the Assistance Plan, the<br/>Consulting Teacher shall make a final report to the RT/VT, and, for RTs<br/>to the JC and the evaluator. A copy of the final report shall be included<br/>in the RT’s-personnel file after he or she has had an opportunity to<br/>review and comment on it. The Final Report shall not constitute the<br/>District’s evaluation of the employee’s performance but, in the case of<br/>a RT, shall (and, in the case of a VT, may at his or her request) be<br/>considered by the site administrator in preparing any evaluation<br/>document or proposing any personnel action.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article shall not be grievable. Any claims that the article has not<br/>been properly implemented shall be presented in writing to the JC, with<br/>a copy to the District and the Association. The JC may review the<br/>complaint and forward to the District and Association its<br/>recommendation regarding implementation. Each year until 2002-<br/>2003 this article shall be automatically reopened for negotiations.<br/>Additionally due to the newness of the PEER Assistance and Review<br/>Program either the District or the Association may reopen any provision<br/>of this Article at any time prior to the beginning of the 2002-2003 school<br/>year for immediate negotiations.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the 2000-2001 fiscal year, if revenue exceeds the<br/>expenditures of this program, the parties shall meet to consider the<br/>matter and shall recommend the allocation of the surplus.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall modify or in any manner affect the right of the<br/>District under provisions of the Education Code relating to the<br/>employment, classification, retention or non-reelection of certificated<br/>employees.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to Regular Assignment</p>
<p>While on assignment as a fulltime consulting teacher, the CT will be<br/>considered on leave to a categorical program from his/her regular<br/>position shall be subject to the return rights of a CT for a 2-year period<br/>and these return rights shall be noted if the position is posted. These<br/>return rights allow a CT to return to his/her previous position if the<br/>previous position is available. If the position still exists, it shall be<br/>considered available regardless of the status of the incumbent. Should<br/>the CT accept a 3<sup>rd</sup> year assignment out of the classroom, the CT’s right<br/>to return to his/her previous position shall be governed by the transfer<br/>process in Article XI of the Negotiated Agreement.

<p>SIDELETTER (Article XV, Section 21)</p>
<p>APPENDIX M- RETIRED CERTIFICATED PERSONNEL HEALTH INSURANCE</p>
<p>The parties to this Collective Bargaining Agreement reaffirm the Collective<br/>Bargaining Agreement provisions in effect at the time of retirement for qualifying<br/>bargaining unit members governing their potential eligibility for a special Retired<br/>Certificated Personnel Health Insurance benefit. It is recognized that this benefit<br/>was first developed and incorporated into the Collective Bargaining Agreement many<br/>years ago when the potential eligibility for Medicare and/or Medical benefits did not<br/>exist or was very restrictive. This benefit was substantially altered for qualifying<br/>bargaining unit members retired on or after July 1, 1984, and is not available for<br/>members hired on or after July 1, 1984. The purpose of this Side Letter is to explain<br/>and clarify the funding formula contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.<br/>If a conflict develops between the language of the Agreement and the Side Letter,<br/>the Collective Bargaining Agreement provisions shall prevail. This Side Letter is<br/>not intended to add to or subtract from, the benefits and qualifications set forth in<br/>the Agreement, nor does it constitute a renegotiation of such provisions. The Side<br/>Letter’s sole purpose is to put into everyday language what is otherwise a potentially<br/>complex funding formula.</p>
<p>A. Retired Certificated Personnel Eligibility Requirements and Benefits</p>
<p>1. Three groups of retirees are recognized concerning this special benefit.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group One consists of qualified and participating pre July 1,<br/>1984 retirees. As of January 1, 2004, 73 such individuals have<br/>been recognized as participating in Group One.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Two consists of qualified post-July 1, 1984 retirees who<br/>were hired prior to July 1, 1984 and meet the requirements set<br/>forth in the Agreement. These requirements include retiring from<br/>the District at age 55 and having twenty (20) consecutive years<br/>of service in the District or the sum of any age above 55 years of<br/>age and consecutive years of service in the District which equals<br/>75. A Board approved leave shall qualify as service for the<br/>purpose of eligibility for this benefit. Employees 50 years old or<br/>above who qualify for disability retirement and otherwise meet<br/>the requirements (except age) shall be eligible for this benefit.<br/>Qualified members who retired from the District and who have<br/>maintained health/dental coverage through a spouse continuing<br/>to work in the District, shall have the right to return to this<br/>program once his/her spouse retires, dies and/or leaves the<br/>District subject to carrier requirements. As of January 1, 2004,<br/>146 such individuals have been recognized as participating in<br/>Group Two.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Three consists of retirees who do not meet the above<br/>criteria for Group One or Two including all of those hired on or<br/>after July 1, 1984. The vast majority of current bargaining unit</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>members will upon retirement join Group Three since only<br/>approximately 16 such employees remained in the District as of<br/>January 1, 2004 qualify for Group Two.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Benefits Received As Retired Certificated Personnel Health<br/>Insurance</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group One retirees receive benefits as provided by a 1985 court<br/>settlement interpreting the Collective Bargaining Agreement<br/>provisions in effect at the time of their retirement. The cost of<br/>maintaining these benefits is not intended to encroach upon the<br/>monies set aside for Group Two retirees. As of July 1, 1984 the<br/>estimated cost of such Group One benefits was $108,000<br/>covering 92.5 full-time participants. The average premium cost<br/>per participant was approximately $1,167.00. Group One<br/>retirees do not receive benefits under Article XV, Section 21, as<br/>it was in effect at the time of the 1985 court settlement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Two retirees are the only Group to receive benefits as a<br/>result of Article XV, Section 21, as it was in effect at the time of<br/>each individual’s retirement. Under this Section the District will<br/>pay the employee only health premium in effect at the time of the<br/>retirement. Benefits under this provision must be integrated<br/>with Medicate and Medi-Cal benefits.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Three retirees will receive no benefits under the Section.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Benefits Received By Group Two Are Available Up To the District<br/>Funds Provided Under The Collective Bargaining Agreement Formula<br/>Explained Below.</p>
<p>a. Step One: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided funds available for Group Two</p>
<p>benefits are annually $235,000 minus a portion of the health<br/>insurance premium paid on behalf of Group One retirees actually<br/>receiving benefits. This portion was fixed at the health insurance<br/>premium paid by the District for Group One retirees for 1984-85,<br/>estimated at $1,167 per retiree (or $108,000 for all 1984-85<br/>Group One retirees). Freezing this amount guaranteed that<br/>rising insurance costs for Group One would not eliminate or<br/>reduce the funds negotiated for Group Two. Since Group One<br/>retirees could not increase in number and would gradually<br/>decline, eventually the entire $235,000 would go to Group Two<br/>for health premium payments. $1,167 is the fixed premium<br/>payment attributed to each Group One retiree in any given year.<br/>This sum is multiplied times the number of retires actually<br/>receiving benefits. The Group One amount is then subtracted<br/>from the $235,000 fund available for Group Two retirees. In this<br/>manner more funds gradually become available for Group Two<br/>retirees as Group One retirees decline in number. As of July 1,</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>2003, 73 Group One retirees (out of an original group of 92.5 FTE<br/>retirees) claimed benefits resulting in $85,192 (rounded to<br/>$85,200) being subtracted from the $235,000 available funds,<br/>leaving a balance of $149,800.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Two:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee only health benefit</p>
<p>premiums for Group Two retirees is obtained from the District.<br/>The available funds from Step One are then applied to the actual<br/>cost. If the available funds are sufficient, then the employee only<br/>health premiums for Group Two retirees is entirely paid by the<br/>District. If this occurs, Step Two ends the calculation. However,<br/>if these funds are not sufficient, then Group Two retirees will be<br/>called upon to make a portion of the payment. Prior to July 1,<br/>2003 it appears that the fund was sufficient. However as of July<br/>1, 2003 the actual premium for 146 Group Two retirees was<br/>$254,197. This was $104,397 greater than the available funds<br/>($254,197 minus $149,800 from Step One), and triggered for the<br/>first time the requirement of individual Group Two retiree<br/>contributions.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Three: If the costs in Step Two are greater than the funds<br/>available through Step One, then the Step Three allocation<br/>processes is necessary. Under the Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement it was agreed that the Group Two retirees would not<br/>have to bare the full amount of any uncovered health premium<br/>costs. It was agreed that a pro-rata amount would be determined<br/>based on the combined number of retirees receiving benefits<br/>(Group One plus Group Two). This combined number of retirees<br/>was then divided into the uncovered health premium costs to<br/>determine the pro-rata amount for each retiree. For Group One<br/>retirees the District pays their pro-rata share of the cost because<br/>of the court settlement and the benefits available under the<br/>Collective Bargaining Agreement when members of this Group<br/>retired, and government programs were generally not available.<br/>For Group Two the retirees are required to pay the pro-rata<br/>amounts as it exceeds the contractually negotiated available<br/>funds. As of July 1. 2003 the total retirees in Group One and<br/>Group Two are 219 (73 plus 146). The uncovered cost is<br/>$104,397 divided by 219). This is the critical number for which<br/>the Group Two retirees are individually responsible. This<br/>represents a cost of approximately $40 per month. Again, the<br/>Group One retirees remain covered by the District as provided by<br/>the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect at the time of their<br/>settlement.</p>
<p>4. Future Benefits Available to Group Two Retirees From the Fund And<br/>The Likelihood That Individuals Contributions Will Be Required.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above calculation (Steps One through Three) will be required<br/>twice a year. The first calculation will be as of July 1 when the<br/>number of new retirees is added to Group Two. A substantial<br/>number were added in July 1, 2003. It is estimated 16 eligible<br/>bargaining unit members remain within the District. The second<br/>calculation will be as of January 1 when the new health<br/>insurance premium is determined. It is expected that this cost<br/>will continue to increase along with health insurance costs<br/>generally.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial calculations are performed by the District and<br/>reviewed by the Association. Following this review, impacted<br/>retirees in Group Two will be notified of required individual<br/>contributions.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the great difficulty<br/>added costs place on retirees. Alternatives are being explored<br/>that might allow some participants to receive a lump sum<br/>payment buying out this contractual benefit. If the eligible Group<br/>Two retiree has access to other health insurance coverage, this<br/>could be a net gain for the retiree and for the remaining eligible<br/>retirees in Group Two. On the other hand the District and the<br/>Association recognize that extreme financial demands exist for<br/>the available General Fund resources, and the District cannot<br/>fund supplemental health insurance coverage beyond what was<br/>contractually negotiated and in place at the time of retirement.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveling time required to and from one’s work site to a SAIT workshop<br/>or training beyond the regular school day shall eligible for such<br/>additional compensation. In the event the unit member goes directly<br/>to and from such workshop or training without going to one’s work site,<br/>the additional time will be measured from and to the work site or from<br/>and to one’s residence whichever is shorter. If this required time is<br/>beyond the regular work day, it also be shall be eligible for such<br/>additional compensation. If two or more locations are available, travel<br/>time will be measured from the closest location available for selection<br/>by the unit member.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a substitute lesson plan is required the actual time spent over<br/>and beyond the regular school day shall be eligible for such additional<br/>compensation provided it does not exceed 1.2 hours per day that a<br/>substitute is present.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance at workshops or training sessions on weekends or during<br/>summer vacation days shall be compensated for at the rate of eight (8)<br/>hours times the current contractual hourly rate. This amount of time<br/>is intended to include all homework requirements.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who serve on the SAIT District Site Liaison Team will be<br/>compensated at the current contractual hourly rate for meeting time<br/>and actual preparation time not to exceed one hour for every two hours<br/>of meeting time. Traveling time to and from meeting outside the regular<br/>school day will be included for compensation using the same<br/>methodology as is described above for workshops and trainings.

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members participating in SAIT Team meetings, workshops or<br/>trainings shall be eligible for mileage reimbursement pursuant to<br/>current District policy.</p>
<p>7. The provisions of this Side Letter on compensation shall be retroactive<br/>to August, 2004, provided adequate SAIT categorical funds are received<br/>and available during the 2004-2005 School Year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that SAIT activities and requirements place additional<br/>demands on unit member. Accordingly certain scheduling and service<br/>adjustments will be made, including:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service on District committees is required or necessary pursuant to<br/>many different District program. However, to the extent that those<br/>commitments can be maintained and significant additional duties are<br/>being required of a unit member due to SAIT, this shall be taken into<br/>consideration in attempting to reduce District committee assignments.<br/>However, nothing shall prevent a unit member from volunteering for<br/>District committee assignments.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday staff meetings are decreased in length by forty (40) minutes a<br/>months, providing for an increase in the Wednesday common planning<br/>time. This arrangement shall remain in effect during the period of the<br/>SAIT program or until otherwise changed by agreement of the site unit<br/>members and site administration.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAIT Program mandates that all certificated staff participate in extra<br/>meetings, trainings, curricular changes, common planning time, additional<br/>parent contacts and revised work schedules as determined by the SAIT Plan.<br/>Consequently, required participation by Bargaining Unit Members in district¬<br/>wide professional development training will be waived until the SAIT<br/>sanctions are removed unless such training is legally or contractually<br/>mandated.</p>

<p>SIDELETTER</p>
<p>APPENDIX P - SCHOOL NURSING: EFFECT OF FTE REDUCTION</p>
<p>The .2 reduction in Nursing FTE’s will involve a proportional reduction in services<br/>provided by nurses within their contractual work day.

To avoid future disagreement, the District agrees to reopen negotiations<br/>on the effects of further program reductions or elimination should such action be<br/>taken by the Board of Education for the 2005-2006 school year or beyond.</p>
