<p>14.1 Personal Illness and Injury Leave</p>
<p>14 .1.1 Full-time employees shall be entitled to ten (10) days of leave with full pay for each<br/>school year for purposes of personal illness or injury. Employees who work less<br/>than full time shall be entitled to such proportion of the ten (10) days leave as the<br/>number of hours per week scheduled duty bears to the number of hours for a full¬<br/>time employee in a comparable position. The District shall provide each unit<br/>member with an ongoing accounting of the number of sick-leave hours he/she has<br/>accumulated, including the current year credit.</p>
<p>14.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any employee does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in Paragraph<br/>1 above, in any school year, the amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year<br/>to year. An employee who leaves the employment of the District prior to the end of<br/>the school year shall have deducted from his/her final salary warrant the value of<br/>any used but unearned sick leave.</p>
<p>14.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee may, at any time, require additional written<br/>verification by the employee’s physician or practitioner. Such verification shall be<br/>required whenever an employee’s absence record shows chronic absenteeism or a<br/>pattern of absences immediately before or after weekends and/or holidays or<br/>whenever clear evidence indicates that an absence is not related to illness or injury<br/>per Admin. Regulation 4161.1.</p>

<p>14.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee may require an employee to visit a physician<br/>selected by the District and at District expense in order to receive a report on the<br/>medical condition of the employee. The report shall include a statement as to the<br/>employee’s need for further leave of absence and a prognosis for when the employee<br/>will be able to return to work. If the report concludes that the employee’s condition<br/>does not warrant continued absences, the Superintendent or designee, may after<br/>giving notice to the employee, deny further leave per Admin Regulation 4161.1.</p>
<p>14.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to work an employee who has been absent for surgery,<br/>hospitalization or extended medical treatment may be asked to submit a letter from<br/>his/her physician stating that he/she is able to return and stipulating any<br/>recommended restrictions or limitations.</p>
<p>14.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall notify the District of his/her need to be absent as soon as such<br/>need is known so that substitute services may be secured.

However,<br/>no such leave shall be granted for purposes of personal convenience, for the<br/>extension of a holiday or vacation, or for matters which can be taken care of<br/>outside of working hours. The Superintendent or designee shall have final<br/>discretion as to whether a request reflects true personal necessity.</p>

<p>14.21.5 Thereafter, in order to remain a participant, a contribution of one (1) day shall<br/>be required of Members whenever, at the end of the school year, the bank<br/>contains less than thirty (30) leave days. A unit member who has less than<br/>fifteen (15) days of sick leave shall be exempt from the required donation.</p>
<p>14.22 Definitions</p>
<p>14.22.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the unit member for an extended period of time or that incapacitates<br/>an immediate member of the unit member’s family.</p>
<p>14.22.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The catastrophic illness or injury requires the unit member to take time off from<br/>work for an extended period of time. Taking extended time off from work will<br/>create a financial hardship for the unit member because he/she has exhausted all<br/>of his/her fully-paid accrued sick leave and other paid time off, with the<br/>exception of extended (differential) sick leave.</p>
<p>14.22.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, leave shall be used in the following order:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accrued fully-paid sick leave,</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;catastrophic leave, and</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extended/differential sick leave,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if available.</p>
<p>14.22.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic leave may also be used for extended bereavement time on account<br/>of the death of a spouse, child or parent.</p>
<p>14.23 Procedure</p>
<p>14.23.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member who is or whose immediate family member is suffering from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury requests in writing that sick leave be transferred<br/>from the leave bank and provides a physician’s verification of catastrophic<br/>injury or illness and files a Catastrophic Leave Form (Appendix H).</p>
<p>14.23.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The designated Association representative shall review the application and<br/>confirm that the employee is unable to work due to verifiable catastrophic<br/>illness or injury or his/her family member’s catastrophic illness or injury and<br/>that the employee has exhausted all accumulated sick leave. MARFAC<br/>President or designee notifies human resources to open bank and forward copies<br/>of documentation from employee to District Office personnel.</p>
<p>14.23.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee and Association representative shall inform unit<br/>member of the number of days that will be dispensed from the leave bank in<br/>response to the member’s approved request.</p>
<p>-21-</p>
<p>14.23 .4 The maximum number of donated catastrophic leave days that may be used by<br/>any unit member will not be more than 20 (twenty) days per academic year.</p>
<p>14.23.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any catastrophic leave days that were approved but were not used shall be<br/>returned to the leave bank that will be monitored by an Association designee.</p>
<p>14.23.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the viability of the program, if at any time, the total number of<br/>days in the bank drops below 20 (twenty) days MARFAC will make a request<br/>for donations from unit members to rebuild the bank to a minimum level of<br/>thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>14.23.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event catastrophic leave is needed for a unit member who does not qualify<br/>because he/she does not have sufficient days to donate to the program, but who<br/>otherwise meet the criteria, a special call by MARFAC for contributions may go<br/>out to members to help fulfill the specific need.</p>
<p>14.24 Return from Leave</p>
<p>14.24.1 A teacher returning from a paid or unpaid leave shall return to the same or similar<br/>position which he/she held prior to the commencement of the leave.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XV - Class Size</p>
<p>15.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the District is to provide a class with no more than twenty-seven (27) students<br/>in any one classroom, in grades 4, 5, and 6. In kindergarten and grades 1, 2, and 3, the<br/>District shall maintain class sizes consistent with Education Code chapter 6.10 Class Size<br/>Reduction Program” for as long as the District elects to participate in the program.</p>
<p>15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the District is to have no more than three students differential between classes at<br/>a grade level at each site.</p>

<p>15.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the District is to provide an aide for each unit member. Aides may be provided<br/>at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>15.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional aide time shall be provided upon request when the number of pupils reaches<br/>thirty (30) in any classroom. The District has the sole discretion to keep the aide if the class<br/>size drops below thirty (30).</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may choose to decline the assistance of an aide unless an aide is required as<br/>a condition of Federal/State categorical funding requirements.</p>
<p>15.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize that careful consideration must be given to the establishment of<br/>combination classes and the assignment of students to such classes. Whether such classes</p>
<p>-22-</p>
<p>are created before or after school starts, all affected unit members will be consulted.</p>
