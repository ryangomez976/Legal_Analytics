Units completed after September 1st, will be paid<br/>the following fiscal year so long as the unit member has provided<br/>the District with official transcripts. If by September 15th, the unit<br/>member is unable to submit official records or transcripts verifying<br/>units of study which are to apply to reclassification, official notices<br/>in the form of a grade card, unofficial transcript, or letter from the<br/>college or university shall be submitted. Such temporary<br/>verification which indicates satisfactory completion of the course(s)<br/>shall be sufficient evidence to meet the above requirement.

<p>Notwithstanding the above, and while the term of this assistance<br/>shall normally be for one school year, the assistance may be<br/>extended up to a second year if the Panel believes significant<br/>progress is being made, although the permanent unit member may<br/>not have returned to a &quot;proficient&quot; level of performance.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 9 - PROFESSIONAL RIGHTS</p>
<p>9.1 Evaluation Procedure</p>
<p>It is recognized that a system of periodic evaluation is essential to assist unit<br/>members in developing competency and realizing their potential. It is further<br/>recognized that information gathered through such a system will enable<br/>Board of Trustees decisions, for which a unit member's competence is<br/>relevant, to be made in a just and equitable manner.</p>
<p>9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary unit members shall be evaluated each<br/>school year.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent (tenured) unit members shall be evaluated every other<br/>year. Either the unit members or the evaluator may initiate more<br/>frequent participation. If a unit member is scheduled to be<br/>evaluated during a particular school year, but is granted a leave of<br/>absence for one (1) semester or longer, such evaluation shall take<br/>place during the first year of return to duty.</p>
<p>9.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent (tenured) unit members who qualify may participate in<br/>the Professional Partners Program as outlined in Appendix E as an<br/>alternative to the formal evaluation process.</p>
<p>9.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be evaluated every five (5) years provided the<br/>unit member: (1) has permanent status; (2) has been employed by<br/>the District for at least ten (10) years; (3) is highly qualified as<br/>defined in 20 U.S.C. Section 7801; (4) had an immediately<br/>preceding evaluation meeting or exceeding standards; and (5) the<br/>unit member and evaluator agree in writing to the five year<br/>evaluation cycle. The unit member or evaluator may withdraw from<br/>the agreement no later than October 1 of any school year in which<br/>case the unit member shall be evaluated that year. This provision<br/>shall not preclude an evaluator from making informal observations<br/>at any time.</p>
<p>9.1.3 Unit members to be evaluated during a particular year can retrieve<br/>evaluation forms, (see Appendices F and M), from the District<br/>website (<a href="http://www.asiusd.k12.ca.us">http://www.asiusd.k12.ca.us</a>) advised of the criteria upon<br/>which the evaluation is to be based, and notified of the identity of<br/>their evaluator no later than October 1<sup>st</sup> of the year in which the<br/>evaluation is to take place.</p>
<p>9.1.3.1 Unit members assigned to more than one site will be observed</p>
<p>once by each Principal. The observing evaluators will jointly write<br/>the final evaluation report and meet with the unit member.</p>

<p>9.1.6.1</p>
<p>9.1.6.2</p>
<p>The unit member being evaluated and the evaluator shall meet no<br/>later than October 15th to discuss:</p>
<p>Four (4) or more objectives and standards to be achieved during<br/>the evaluation period. A maximum of two (2) objectives may be<br/>determined by the evaluator if the previous evaluation was<br/>satisfactory. In the case of a previous unsatisfactory evaluation,<br/>the evaluator may determine no more than (4) objectives.</p>
<p>A schedule of formal observations, conferences and final evaluation<br/>dates will be given to each unit member. In the event of a<br/>disagreement over the objectives, standards and/or evaluation<br/>schedule, the unit member and the evaluator shall:</p>
<p>Make a good faith effort to resolve the differences themselves.</p>
<p>If differences are unable to be resolved, each shall have the<br/>opportunity to state their position on the matter(s) in dispute, and to<br/>have a written statement attached to the evaluation form.</p>
<p>The unit member shall have the right to identify in writing and attach<br/>any constraints which the unit member believes may inhibit her/his<br/>ability to meet the objectives and standards established.</p>
<p>During the course of the evaluation, circumstances may change<br/>which require modification of the original objectives and standards.<br/>The unit member and/or evaluator may initiate a change of these<br/>objectives and standards in a manner prescribed in Section 9.1.4<br/>above.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall include the following activities:</p>
<p>Two (2) formal classroom observations shall last at least thirty (30)<br/>minutes and each shall be made known to the unit member at least<br/>five (5) days prior to their occurrence. Observations shall include a<br/>pre and post conference. The post-conference shall occur within<br/>five (5) days of the observation and include written feedback.</p>
<p>A unit member who receives a negative evaluation shall, upon<br/>request, be entitled to additional classroom observations,<br/>evaluation conferences and written evaluations. Such entitlement<br/>has timelines and conferences as per 9.1.6.1. A negative<br/>evaluation is defined as unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>9.1.6.3 In the case of negative evaluation (s), or if any problems are noted<br/>as per Section 9.1.6, the unit member shall take positive actions to<br/>correct any cited deficiencies. The evaluator shall take positive<br/>action to assist the unit member in correcting any cited deficiencies.<br/>The evaluator's role to assist the unit member shall include, but not<br/>be limited to, the following:</p>
<p>9.1.6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific recommendations for improvement.</p>
<p>9.1.6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site/District assistance to implement such recommendations.</p>
<p>9.1.6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision of additional resources, without cost to the unit member,<br/>to be utilized to assist with improvements.</p>
<p>9.1.6.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Techniques to measure improvement.</p>
<p>9.1.6.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time schedule to monitor progress.</p>
<p>9.1.6.4 In preparing the final evaluation form for placement in the unit</p>
<p>member's personnel file, the evaluator shall rely primarily upon data<br/>collected through classroom observations and evaluation<br/>conferences. Comments on the evaluation may include<br/>commendations; recommendations; parent and pupil relations;<br/>working relationships with staff; and the care of facilities,<br/>equipment, and materials. Unsubstantiated statements shall not be<br/>included in the evaluation.</p>
<p>9.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final evaluation conference between the unit member and<br/>evaluator shall be held no later than May 1<sup>st</sup> to discuss the content<br/>of the final evaluation form. In the event the unit member disputes<br/>the content, the unit member may prepare a written statement<br/>which shall be attached and incorporated into the final evaluation.<br/>Unit members have the right to request association representation<br/>to be present at the final evaluation meeting.</p>
<p>9.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be required to participate in the<br/>evaluation(s) and/or observation(s) of other unit members, except<br/>as provided for in the Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Article 8<br/>of this Agreement.</p>
<p>9.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of unit members, pursuant to this Article, shall not<br/>include or be based upon the following:</p>
<p>9.1.9.1 Standardized achievement test results, except as mandated in</p>
<p>Education Code Section 44662 which may require the use of state</p>
<p>adopted criterion referenced assessments related to statewide<br/>content standards.</p>
<p>9.1.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of any tests utilized for the purpose of a School<br/>Improvement Plan.</p>
<p>9.1.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achievement of objectives stated in Individual Educational<br/>Programs (lEP's) of special education pupils.</p>
<p>9.1.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success, or lack thereof, of an instructional or clerical aide in<br/>the performance of tasks assigned by the unit member.</p>
<p>9.1.9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intercoms and television cameras used for communications and<br/>monitoring safety conditions shall not be used for the purposes of<br/>evaluation of unit members.</p>
<p>9.1.10 The evaluator shall take into consideration constraints such as lack<br/>of access to textbooks, reference books, equipment, supplies,<br/>materials, storage space, educational technology and classroom<br/>facilities to properly perform his/her assigned duties.</p>
<p>9.2 California Standards for the Teaching Profession</p>
<p>The California Standards for the Teaching Profession has adopted</p>
<p>professional standards that will guide unit member preparation programs and</p>
<p>new teacher assignments. These standards are organized around six (6)</p>
<p>interrelated categories of teaching practice, (see Appendix G).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create and Maintain Effective Environments for Student Learning.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engage and Support all Students in Learning.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand and Organize Subject Matter for Student Learning.</p>

<p>10.1 Purpose</p>

<p>10.1.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules, orders and penalties should be applied fairly and equitably.</p>

<p>10.2 Progressive Discipline</p>
<p>The following progressive discipline procedures will be applied except where<br/>the serious nature of the offense may require the District to directly impose a<br/>written warning, written reprimand, or suspension without pay.

<p>10.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal Counseling/Warning</p>

<p>Suspension Without Pay</p>
<p>Except for action taken under section 10.7, subject to 10.2.3 above,<br/>suspension may not be used unless the unit member has received<br/>a written reprimand about similar actions within the last twelve (12)<br/>months. No unit member will be suspended more than fifteen (15)<br/>working days during a school year.

<p>43</p>
<p>10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality</p>
<p>All information or proceedings regarding any actions or proposed actions<br/>pursuant to the Article will be kept confidential by the parties to the extent<br/>permitted by law.

Nothing in Article 10 shall limit the District’s right to<br/>institute dismissal, immediate suspension and mandatory leave of absence<br/>proceedings as set forth in Education Code, Sections 44932 through 44948.5<br/>and subsequent amendments and supplements thereto, nor shall discipline<br/>under this Article or any other terms of the Article be regarded as a<br/>precondition to, or limitation upon, such Code proceedings. In such cases,<br/>the Superintendent may skip progressive discipline steps and suspend a unit<br/>member as set forth in provisions of the Education Code pending Board<br/>action when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, continuation of the unit<br/>member in their position would present a clear danger to the students, staff,<br/>property or reputation of the District, or to the unit member. In such cases,<br/>the Superintendent must provide the unit member with a written justification of<br/>this action, but said justification may be provided after the suspension has<br/>taken effect. If the District attempts to suspend a unit member pursuant to<br/>Education Code and fails, the District is prohibited from attempting to impose<br/>any discipline under this article for the same offense.</p>

<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/Guardian Involvement and Information</p>
<p>It is the belief of the Association and the District that student achievement is<br/>enhanced when parent/guardian involvement is increased. The Association<br/>and the District are committed to increasing parent/guardian participation in<br/>the education of students. With the active involvement of parents/guardians<br/>comes an increase in visitors to the school site. To that end, in order to<br/>support the needs and rights of the parents/guardians and unit members and<br/>to ensure the safety of students and unit members, the following procedures<br/>shall be followed.</p>
<p>12.5.1 Parents/guardians wishing to review materials for use in their</p>
<p>student's classroom shall provide a written request to the student's<br/>teacher(s) at least three (3) work-days prior to the date the</p>

<p>parent/guardian wishes to come to the school to review the<br/>materials.</p>
<p>12.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the unit member's agreement as to the date and time, the<br/>parent(s)/guardian(s) may come to the school to review the<br/>materials.</p>
<p>12.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such review shall not take place without the consent of the unit<br/>member during the duty free lunch-time, or any other duty free<br/>break times during the workday.</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent(s)/guardian(s) wishing to observe in a unit member's<br/>classroom shall provide a written request at least three (3)<br/>workdays prior to the day of the requested observation.</p>
<p>12.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the unit member's agreement as to the date of an<br/>observation, the parent(s)/guardian(s) may observe the classroom<br/>at any time during the student instructional day.</p>
<p>12.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observation shall last no longer than one (1) hour.</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 The time and frequency of observations will be mutually agreed</p>
<p>upon among the unit member, parent(s) or guardian(s), and the<br/>Principal.</p>
<p>12.5.2.4 If, during the course of an observation, the parent(s)/guardian(s)<br/>presence becomes disruptive, the unit member shall have the<br/>authority to tell the parent(s)/guardian(s) to leave the classroom<br/>and/or ask for assistance from the Principal.</p>
<p>12.5.2.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall report any such incidents to the Principal as<br/>soon after the incident as possible.</p>
<p>12.5.2.4.2A disruptive parent/guardian shall not be allowed to observe the<br/>unit member's classroom again unless agreed to by the unit<br/>member and the Principal.</p>
<p>12.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall pursue appropriate legal action against any<br/>parent/guardian who demonstrates a pattern of disruptive behavior<br/>while visiting a worksite.</p>
<p>12.6 Pupil Transportation</p>
<p>12.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit members shall be requested or required to transport pupils<br/>in private vehicles.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>12.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the District request or require that a unit member transport a<br/>pupil or pupils in a vehicle owned by the District, the District shall<br/>provide full primary liability coverage for any liability which may<br/>occur during such assignment. Unit members shall be provided<br/>with documentation of primary liability coverage which shall be<br/>carried in the vehicle during such assignment.</p>
<p>12.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall follow procedures outlined in AR 3542.1 (a) see<br/>Appendix H.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imminent danger to the unit member’s home, occasioned by<br/>an event such as flood, fire, or earthquake.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences due to causes beyond the unit member’s control,<br/>such as those caused by storm, flood or other acts of nature.</p>
<p>Although advanced permission is not required, unit members must<br/>notify the District upon learning of the reason for the leave and<br/>complete the Request for Short Term Leave form upon returning to<br/>work.</p>
<p>Any unit member who has exhausted his/her sick leave days and<br/>has not applied for catastrophic leave (as defined in 13.3) is entitled<br/>to differential pay for up to one-hundred (100) days.</p>
<p>A unit member shall contact the District substitute caller as soon as<br/>the need to be absent is known.</p>
<p>Upon request by the District, a unit member who has used five (5)<br/>consecutive days of sick leave in any year may be required to<br/>present a medical doctor’s certificate verifying the personal illness<br/>or injury and/or medical authorization to return to work unless used<br/>for personal necessity days.</p>
<p>If an illness or injury exceeds ten (10) consecutive days, the District<br/>may require a certified medical specialist, selected and reimbursed<br/>by the District to examine the unit member, verify the nature and<br/>severity of the illness or injury, and report such finding to the<br/>District.

<p>13.3 Catastrophic Sick Leave</p>
<p>13.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Catastrophic illness&quot; or &quot;injury&quot; means an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate the unit member for an extended period of<br/>time, or that incapacitates a member of the unit member’s family<br/>such that the unit member must take time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time to care for that family member, and taking<br/>extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the unit<br/>member because he/she has exhausted all of his/her sick leave.</p>
<p>13.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall establish a Catastrophic Leave Bank to which all<br/>unit members may donate earned and unused sick leave days.</p>
<p>This donation shall be irrevocable, and shall be accomplished by<br/>the unit member filing a “Catastrophic Leave Bank Donation Form,”<br/>(see Appendix K), with Human Resources.</p>

<p>Unit members who no longer want to participate must cancel their<br/>membership by submitting written notification to the Human<br/>Resource department by October 1 st of the current school year.</p>
<p>The unit member shall not be eligible to draw from the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank as of the effective date of cancellation. Sick leave<br/>previously authorized for contribution to the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank shall not be returned.</p>
<p>Unit members wishing to use the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall<br/>submit a “Catastrophic Leave Bank Request for Withdrawal Form”<br/>(see Appendix L).

<p>The Committee may issue an additional &quot;Call for Catastrophic<br/>Leave Donations&quot; whenever the Catastrophic Leave Bank has<br/>fewer days than are requested. If the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal request, the<br/>Committee is under no obligation to provide days and the District is<br/>under no obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If<br/>the Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension of<br/>withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the request, they<br/>shall notify the participant, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>A unit member who receives paid sick leave pursuant to this<br/>section shall use any leave days that he/she continues to accrue on<br/>a monthly basis prior to receiving paid leave pursuant to this<br/>section.</p>

If any employee presents a grievance on<br/>her/his own behalf, the Association shall have the right to be<br/>present and state its views at all grievance meetings. The District<br/>shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the Association<br/>has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution<br/>and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>

<p>APPENDIX E - PROFESSIONAL PARTNERS</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL PARTNERS PROGRAM<br/>AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL TEACHER EVALUATION</p>
<p>PROGRAM GOALS</p>
<p>The Strategic Plan of the District states that we are a community of learners in which<br/>everyone participates both as teachers and as learners and that we establish goals and<br/>accountability standards for students, staff, and programs, using a variety of means to<br/>assess success in meeting those goals and standards. As a District, we are committed<br/>to the ongoing improvement of our programs, and to the continued growth and<br/>development of our staff. For this reason, we have made extraordinary investments in<br/>staff development, and we have been particularly attentive to the teacher evaluation<br/>process.</p>
<p>The traditional Stull evaluation process, while often quite valuable, is a hierarchical<br/>model that is driven by administration. The Professional Partners Program is an<br/>attempt to develop an alternative to traditional evaluation that is self and peer driven. It<br/>is an attempt to develop reflective professional practices that lead to improved<br/>performance in the classroom and to the establishment of a true community of learners<br/>among staff members.</p>
<p>PROGRAM SUMMARY</p>
<p>The Professional Partners Program has three basic phases:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of annual goals.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of three peer observations including pre- and post-observation<br/>conferences.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final conference and self-evaluation.</p>
<p>A peer and the Principal participate in the process.</p>
<p>ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>In order to be eligible to participate in the Professional Partners Program as an<br/>alternative to the regular evaluation process, a teacher must:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a permanent employee of District</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have received satisfactory annual evaluations, as determined by the Principal,<br/>for the three preceding evaluation cycles.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree to participate in the Professional Partners Program and to meet all of the<br/>program requirements.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree to participate in two days of training to be scheduled prior to the<br/>commencement of the regular work year.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>APPENDIX E - PROFESSIONAL PARTNERS CONTINUED</p>
<p>Please note the following in relation to eligibility:</p>
<p>_ September 28: Schedule a minimum of three peer observations including</p>
<p>pre-observation and post-observation conferences.</p>
<p>_Complete peer observation number one.</p>
<p>_Complete peer observation number two.</p>
<p>_Complete peer observation number three.</p>
<p>_Short written summary produced for each peer observation.</p>
<p>_Principal included in at least one peer observation cycle.</p>
<p>_ Prior to April 15: All three observations completed.</p>
<p>FINAL SELF-EVALUATION</p>
<p>No later than four weeks prior to the end of the school year, the teacher will write a self-<br/>evaluation, including reflections on success in meeting program goals and learning that<br/>took place through the peer observation process. This draft self-evaluation is submitted<br/>to the partner and the Principal. A conference is held between the teacher, partner, and<br/>Principal to discuss the draft. A final draft is completed by the teacher, signed by the<br/>Principal and partner, and placed in the teacher’s permanent personnel file.</p>
<p>_ April 30: Complete written self-evaluation and submit to Principal and</p>
<p>partner.</p>
<p>_ May 5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference with Principal and partner to discuss self-evaluation</p>
<p>draft.</p>
<p>_ May 8: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;final self-evaluation, obtain Principal and partner</p>
<p>signatures, and submit to personnel file.</p>
<p>OTHER NOTES</p>
<p>The Professional Partnership Program should be viewed as a pilot program. It will be<br/>reviewed and revised as we gain experience with the program. Until agreed otherwise,<br/>teachers who participate in the Professional Partners Program will participate in the<br/>regular evaluation process every fourth year.</p>

Each time a driver is convicted of a<br/>moving traffic law violation, the court notifies the Department of Motor Vehicles. A<br/>record of the conviction is placed in the driver’s license file. Convictions are<br/>counted as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a traffic conviction shows that a person drives a motor vehicle<br/>unsafely on a highway, it counts as one point towards determination of a<br/>negligent driver.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two points are charged if the driver is convicted of:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reckless driving</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitting an unattended vehicle without notifying the owner</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Causing property damage, injury,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or death by hit-and-run driving</p>

<p>97</p>
<p>EMPLOYEE USE OF DISTRICT-OWNED VEHICLE (continued)</p>
<p>AR 3542.1(b)</p>
<p>c. An accident is normally counted as one point.</p>
<p>For district purposes, a driver is considered a negligent operator of a motor</p>

<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points in a 12-month period</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points in a 24-month period</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points in a 36-month period</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district reserves the right to refuse an employee authorization to operate a<br/>district vehicle if the individual is determined to be a negligent operator in<br/>accordance with No. 3 above or fails to maintain a valid California Class A, B or C<br/>driver’s license.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Transportation Office shall maintain a list of approve employees who are<br/>authorized to operate district vehicles.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “district vehicle” is defined as “a motor vehicle owned by the district used for the<br/>purpose of moving or propelling any person or property upon a highway, and not to<br/>exceed more than 10 passengers including the driver, no matter what size the<br/>vehicle is.” If more than 10 passengers are to be carried, they must be in a school<br/>bus or a student pupil activity bus as defined in the Vehicle Code.</p>
