<p>ARTICLE 3.0: Class Size</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Article, a teacher is defined as any certificated individual assigned to a full-day class of<br/>instruction on a regular basis, exclusive of special education. This could be for whatever portion of the day<br/>they are assigned (1 hour = 20% of an assignment).</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitional Kindergarten through third grade classes district wide shall be staffed to comply with student-<br/>teacher ratios as determined by Education Code 41376 and 41378; or staffed at levels in compliance with a<br/>fully funded, non-encroaching, Class Size Reduction program, whichever class size is less. In addition, the<br/>school wide annual kindergarten through third grade class size averages shall not exceed any classroom<br/>maximum as defined in Education Codes 41376 and 41378. The parties agree to this language in order to<br/>comply with the class size reduction requirements set forth in the Local Control Funding Formula<br/>(Education Code 42238.02). Should any authority of competent jurisdiction conclude that this language<br/>does not satisfy those requirements, the parties agree to meet as soon as possible with the intent of<br/>negotiating language that will satisfy those requirements.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an individual class in grades 4, 5 and 6 exceeds thirty-five (35) students for more than twenty (20)<br/>days, relief procedures as set forth below shall be instituted.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grades 7 through 8, an individual teacher’s class size average in the four content areas of math, science,<br/>language arts, and social science, shall not exceed thirty-five (35) students (175 student contacts).<br/>Recognizing the collaborative relationship between the Association and the District, an individual teacher<br/>or staff may voluntarily agree to exceed these limits to deliver programs in an alternative way. When a<br/>teacher’s student contacts exceed 175 for more than twenty (20) days, relief procedures as set forth below<br/>shall be initiated.</p>
<p>Class size for activity classes, such as art, band, chorus, orchestra, and industrial arts, will be established<br/>with consideration given to safety, and space available. Physical education class size averages will be fifty-<br/>five (55) students, or fewer, with no class exceeding sixty (60) students without the concurrence of the<br/>teacher.</p>
<p>3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relief procedures referenced above are as follows and may include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of students within the school.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of students between schools.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addition of a staff member.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Helper assistance to students in the individual classroom(s) involved.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itinerant specialist/physical education, art, music, etc.</p>
<p>The site administrator shall discuss with his/her staff the relief procedure to be implemented before the<br/>final decision is made by the site administrator.</p>
<p>3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific attention shall be paid to the composition of combination classes pertaining to the selectivity and<br/>numbers of students as compared to the makeup of single grade classes.</p>
<p>- 4 -</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4.0: Hours of Employment</p>
<p>4.1 A. It is recognized that full-time employees’ workweek is normally in excess of forty (40) hours. The<br/>immediate supervisor or site administrator shall set the on-site work day.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular full-time general and special education teachers and Speech-Language Pathologists<br/>shall provide a seven- (7) hour school-based work day, inclusive of lunch. The remaining time<br/>which may be required for fulfilling those duties described in section 4.1.C.1 and 2 and which<br/>may require that teachers and/or Speech-Language Pathologists be present on-site shall be<br/>determined by the site administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employees not assigned to a general or special education class/caseload shall work an eight</p>
<p>(8)-hour on-site day, exclusive of lunch. These positions are considered support personnel and<br/>include, but are not limited to, site resource teachers/specialists, site coaches, counselor,<br/>psychologist and nurse.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District coaches, district resource teachers, data coaches and Deans of students will work a<br/>professional work day, i.e., if they have duties and responsibilities which would require them to<br/>work an extended day, they will work those hours. On the other hand, if there are no<br/>responsibilities to be performed beyond the seven (7)-hour work day, then the Deans and<br/>district coaches may conclude their day accordingly.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time employees based at a school site are required to attend Open House, Back-to-School<br/>Night, and staff development days on a full-time basis. Part-time employees who accept full<br/>benefits shall attend the modified day professional community learning time. Part-time<br/>employees shall have pro rata responsibilities in terms of their non-teaching responsibilities, i.e.,<br/>duties, staff meetings, etc. It is up to the principal and the part-time employee to determine the<br/>dates and times and distribution of the pro rata sharing of out-of-classroom responsibilities. The<br/>La Mesa-Spring Valley School District does not compensate teachers for instructional<br/>preparation time. Classroom position salary reflects compensation for instructing students. In<br/>order to provide the preschool teachers with a contracted position of 4.5 hours per day, it was<br/>necessary to include 1.5 hours of non-instructional time. The 1.5 hours of non-instructional time<br/>is to: work at a site or with a PLC; to fulfill requirements for continual improvement, and other<br/>improvement measures established by program funding contracts and annual teacher evaluations<br/>of students. These 1.5 hours shall be directed by the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employees who work seven (7) or more hours per day shall be provided not less than a thirty<br/>(30)-minute, duty-free lunch period.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers and Deans of Students are to be on school premises a half (V<sub>2</sub>)-hour before the scheduled<br/>starting time of classes.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those duties and responsibilities of each employee in his/her respective assignment are those as<br/>set forth in job descriptions and summarized below:</p>
<p>1. Professional Commitment</p>
<p>Active participation in a collaborative culture/Professional Learning Community (PLC) with<br/>a focus on learning. Through collective inquiry, transform best practice into current reality.<br/>Commitment to learning, professional development and continuous improvement (e.g.,<br/>20/20 Vision).</p>
<p>Articulate standards (e.g., Common Core) to students and colleagues using district-adopted<br/>curriculum. Utilize quality diagnostic, formative and summative assessments and analyze<br/>data to inform instruction. Commitment to quality first dose instruction that includes lesson<br/>planning, research-based strategies and differentiated instruction (intervention, acceleration,<br/>enrichment). Maintain accurate records and score student work.</p>
<p>Attend staff, PLC, Site Learning Day (SLD) and professional development<br/>meetings/inservices; IEP and SST meetings; District committee assignments. Engage in<br/>parent communication, conferences and events that showcase learning, foster parent<br/>communication, customer service and public relations (Open House, Back-to-School Night).<br/>Ensure supervision of students, including school-sponsored or approved activities such as<br/>study trips and student body activities.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School and District Activities</p>
<p>Parent/employee meetings and activities; school and employee receptions; open house/back-<br/>to-school night; public school observance; supervision of students at school-sponsored or<br/>approved activities such as study trips, athletic events, student body activities; extended<br/>professional meetings.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the essential suspension of class size reduction (CSR) class size limits, the<br/>following subsection shall remain in suspension until such time as class size reduction class<br/>sizes are restored.</p>
<p>1. Elementary Non-Class Size Reduction Accommodations:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contingent upon the continuation of Class Size Reduction (CSR) in the District in three</p>
<p>or more grades, the following accommodations shall be made:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide first choice for scheduling options (e.g., library, guided process reading<br/>groups, lunch). The exception will be kindergarten lunch.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide two total days of release time per elementary site per trimester, to be<br/>shared by non-CSR teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-CSR teachers may refuse student council and safety patrol as adjunct duties.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is suggested that each school site also consider selections from the following</p>
<p>options:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a flexible adjunct duty schedule with fewer duties for non-CSR.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-CSR teachers assign fewer before/after school duties.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a PE schedule that results in lower class size and/or creates preparation<br/>time for non-CSR teachers.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give priority to non-CSR teachers for college student helpers for clerical<br/>support, GPR groups, etc.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give priority to non-CSR teachers to utilize middle/high school cross-age tutors.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide release time for non-CSR teachers to complete activities such as<br/>balanced literacy staging, report cards, and grading of direct writing.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give non-CSR teachers small group or release time by creating a cross-age<br/>literacy time once per week.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When possible, redistribute non-CSR students during non-core<br/>instructional times (physical education, art, music).</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When possible, assign non-CSR the largest classrooms.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a schedule that allows limited or no duties for non-CSR teachers<br/>during peak activity times and/or one week prior to report cards being due.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilize university programs to support non-CSR teachers.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have administrators serve as “guest teachers” in non-CSR classes and/or<br/>facilitate groups.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use roving site substitutes and/or extra substitute time to provide assistance to<br/>non-CSR teachers.</p>
<p>- 6 -</p>
<p>14. Utilize roving teacher(s) to complete fifth grade physical fitness testing.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the practice of the District to provide .06 TUnit for each elementary school, to be used for<br/>the purpose of hiring playground attendants to supervise recess periods. The principal and teachers at<br/>each school site shall determine how this increase shall be best utilized for that facility. This practice<br/>shall remain in effect each year hereafter until such time as budgetary constraints may compel<br/>otherwise. Should that occur, the Association will be formally advised of that situation and a meeting<br/>shall be held to discuss the reasons for such action.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school employees shall be provided a daily preparation period—the equivalent of one (1)<br/>instructional period.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructional periods at LMMS, PKMS and SVMS are considered 20% of a work day.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the unique block schedule of LPMS, an instructional period is considered 25% of<br/>an instructional day.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An advisory period at a middle school is considered ten percent (10%) of an instructional day.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual employees, coordinating with their supervisor, may request and arrange for relief breaks<br/>after two (2) hours of instruction.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itinerant personnel, and those who travel from one site to another on a regular basis, shall have<br/>the same provision for planning/preparation period as do all other employees.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education Clerical Assistance and Planning:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary RSP teachers’ assignments shall include at least ten (10) percent of their<br/>instructional time to complete assessment, scheduling and paperwork to satisfy IEP<br/>requirements and meet compliance issues.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school RSP teachers shall have an additional preparation period or its equivalent for<br/>assessment scheduling and paperwork to complete IEP requirements and satisfy compliance<br/>issues. Since La Presa Middle School has a unique block schedule, their RSP teachers’<br/>schedules will be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech Language Pathologists shall receive 20 hours of clerical support per year, which will<br/>be pro-rated based on assignment. For example, a 100% SLP shall receive 20 hours of<br/>clerical support; an 80% SLP shall receive 16 hours. In return, SLPs shall maintain a log of<br/>student contacts on a district provided form; this completed form shall be delivered to the<br/>special education department each month.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDC teachers shall receive two (2) hours of clerical assistance time per annual and triennial<br/>IEP, per year, to be used for scheduling and paperwork associated with IEP meetings. One<br/>annual IEP includes all meetings associated with completion of the IEP document. There may<br/>be numerous meetings to complete the IEP.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerical assistance shall be accessed through the site principal. It is expected that teachers will<br/>provide sufficient notice to allow the site principal to arrange for the clerical support. Typically,<br/>clerical assistance will be completed by a site employee or substitute.</p>
<p>SHARED CONTRACTS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any two (2) elementary site assigned employees with the appropriate credentials may request the<br/>sharing of a contract. Upon the approval of die administrators involved, and with mutual<br/>agreement of the employees, they shall be provided pro rata compensation and all benefits as the<br/>law and this Agreement allows. Any such plan shall be evaluated on the merits that represent the<br/>best interest of the educational program of the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than two (2) shared contracts may be implemented at each site.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Shared Contract Plan must be submitted to the principal by May 1, or for mid-year shared<br/>contracts, sixty (60) days prior to the start of the shared assignment.</p>
<p>Said plan must show how your team will address the following issues:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/teacher conferences</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/teacher communication - 7 -</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student evaluation</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team member/team member communication, i.e., adequate contact time to ensure<br/>program continuity</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom management</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom discipline</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage of grade-level meetings and staff meetings</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendar of teacher workdays</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample of daily schedule</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any supplemental duties as stated in Article 4 of the Agreement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflict resolution system for shared-contract participants</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared contracts shall be for one (1) year. The subsequent year the shared contract may be renewed<br/>with the mutual agreement of the principal, Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources and the unit<br/>members sharing a contract. If the shared contract is not renewed for any reason, said position will<br/>revert to a full-time position. The unit members will be returned to full-time contracts unless either or<br/>both unit members locate another person willing to job share, subject to approval of the District and<br/>pursuant to the procedures outlined in this article. If no new shared contract is located by the unit<br/>member(s) and approved by the District, both unit members will be assigned to an available full-time<br/>position at the current site, unless the unit member(s) agree(s) to a voluntary transfer. If there is only<br/>one vacant position available at the site, the unit member with the least District seniority shall be<br/>transferred to a position at another site for which the unit member is credentialed to teach.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who share a contract shall be required to attend Back-to-School Night, Open House,<br/>and parent conferences. Employees shall also be required to work full days on staff development<br/>days, and teacher work days, i.e., non-student days.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who accept full benefits shall be required to attend the modified day professional<br/>learning time.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowed shared contract configurations are as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher works each day, fifty percent (50%) of the time.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher works full-time for one semester, and partner works the other semester full-time.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One team member works full-time Wednesday through Tuesday straight through, with the other<br/>teacher working the next week, Wednesday through Tuesday. This concept requires a lay-over<br/>day which in this case would be Tuesday afternoon when the teachers meet to discuss student<br/>progress, preserving continuity of instruction, etc. Of course, it could be Thursday to<br/>Wednesday, as long as it is a mid-week arrangement with a lay-over day.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One teacher works Monday-Tuesday, then the other teacher works Wednesday-Thursday, and<br/>the teachers alternate on the Fridays of each week. Some arrangements allow for<br/>Monday/Tuesday and Thursday/Friday, with the alternating lull day on Wednesday. With the<br/>following stipulations:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers must write their plan each year, i.e., recommit to the team annually.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers meet at least once per week with their partner to dialog. Moreover, daily<br/>written journals or logs highlighting instructional points are very desirable.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaming teachers are together for SST meetings, school activities, grade-level<br/>planning meetings, and professional growth days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evaluation process, both teachers have the same objectives and goals.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternate configuration as approved by site principal and Assistant Superintendent, Human</p>
<p>Resources.</p>
<p>- 8 -</p>
<p>4.3</p>
<p>SIGN-IN PROCEDURES</p>
<p>It shall be the principal’s responsibility to establish sign-in procedures at his/her individual site.</p>
<p>The District and Association agree that all teachers shall acknowledge their departure any time<br/>they leave campus during their work day and note their arrival upon return.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WORK YEAR</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions specified hereunder are intended to take full advantage of the incentives contained in<br/>sections 46200 through 46203 of the Education Code.</p>

<p>9.1.1 GUIDING PRINCIPLES</p>
<p>We believe there is a responsibility to serve and understand all student populations within the District, to<br/>achieve common goals linked to learning, and to strengthen Professional Learning Communities. Federal<br/>and state mandates may also require the District to balance staffs. The transfer and reassignment process is<br/>one way these responsibilities can be met.</p>
<p>This process needs to be embraced by all employees. Consequently, a transfer, or reassignment, should be<br/>viewed as an opportunity to expand one’s horizons, to work with diverse populations, and to experience the<br/>positive climate and culture of every area of the District. Therefore, we believe each employee should<br/>voluntarily seek transfer throughout his or her career. In addition, the District and Association believe<br/>movement that enhances the overall function of specific Professional Learning Communities should be<br/>given special consideration. The transfer and reassignment process must occur in a fair and equitable<br/>manner. Furthermore, there should also be some consideration of the individual needs of employees.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit employees (BUE) are employees of the District and not of any particular assignment<br/>and/or physical location.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer is defined as &quot;Movement from one location (site) to another within the District.&quot;</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment is defined as &quot;A change of responsibilities, grade level, subject matter area, or specialist<br/>area at the same site or another site, in accordance with the employee's experience, training/education, and<br/>credential status.&quot;</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacant positions are those created as a result of a transfer, reassignment, retirement, resignation,<br/>dismissal, and/or a newly-created position approved by the Board. A vacancy may also result from an<br/>increase in positions needed.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISTRICT-INITIATED TRANSFER</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon recommendation to and approval by the Superintendent or his/her designee, district-initiated<br/>transfers shall be made when determined to be desirable and in the best interest of the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common reasons for district-initiated transfers include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balanced staffing with respect to state/federal comparability guidelines.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compliance with any other state and federal guidelines.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boundary changes and/or reduction of facilities and/or staff.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In initiating transfers, the District shall utilize the following process and criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall solicit qualified volunteers.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effectuating all transfers, the District shall make every effort to first utilize employee-<br/>initiated requests from employees who qualify under the criteria as set forth in this section.</p>

If the potential transferees still rank equally then the person with the greatest length<br/>of service in the District shall be given the option of receiving the transfer.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except by mutual agreement, no employee may be transferred more than once every two (2) years.<br/>The exception to this would be transfers necessitated by declining enrollment or change in<br/>programs offered when no other person could be transferred.</p>

The employee may have an Association representative present at such meeting.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor is the first-level site administrator designated to hear a grievance.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A party in interest is any person or persons making the claim or any person against whom action might<br/>be taken to resolve the claim.</p>

<p>Before filing a written grievance, the grievant(s) shall attempt to resolve the problem at an informal<br/>conference with his/her immediate supervisor. Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the<br/>right of an employee to discuss a problem informally with any appropriate member of the administration,<br/>providing any resolution reached is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and the Association<br/>has been given the opportunity to review the resolution.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FORMAL LEVEL</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I</p>
<p>Within twenty (20) days from the time the grievant(s) learned of the event, or condition, which gave rise<br/>to the grievance, it must be presented, in writing, to the immediate supervisor. At no time can a<br/>grievance be filed, relating to a violation of this Agreement, more than ninety (90) working days after<br/>the alleged violation. The immediate supervisor shall communicate his/her decision in writing, within<br/>seven (7) days after receiving the grievance. In the interim time, a grievance conference will be held.

Mediation recommendations will be advisory to the parties.</p>
<p>- 39 -</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level III, or the time limits<br/>expire without the issuance of the Superintendent’s written reply, the grievant(s) may submit the<br/>grievance to the Association which will determine whether the matter may go to Level IV. If the<br/>Association approves arbitration, the parties shall request a list of arbitrators from the California<br/>State Conciliation Service. If the District raises the question as to the arbitrability of the grievance,<br/>the first arbitrator selected shall be charged with rendering a decision as to the question of<br/>arbitrability. Such challenge may only be made once by the District in the processing of an<br/>individual or consolidated grievance. Unless mutually agreed otherwise, the arbitrator who<br/>decided the issue of arbitrability will not later sit as the arbitrator on the other issue(s) of the<br/>grievance. If a second arbitrator is necessary, procedures for selection shall be according to<br/>Sections 13.3.E.1 and 13.3.E.4 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No party in interest shall be permitted to assert any grounds or evidence before the arbitrator<br/>which was not previously disclosed to the other party. The arbitrator shall consider only those<br/>issues raised by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator is empowered to include in any recommendation, financial reimbursements or other<br/>remedies as judged to be proper. Each party shall bear the full costs of its representation in the<br/>arbitration. The cost of the arbitration shall be divided equally between the District and the<br/>Association. If either party requests a transcription of the proceedings, that party shall bear the full<br/>costs for that transcript. If the parties mutually request a transcript, the total cost of the transcripts<br/>shall be divided equally between the District and the Association.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arbitrator shall be selected by the following procedure: A representative of the Association and<br/>the District’s representative shall select the arbitrator from the California State Conciliation<br/>Service list by eliminating names until one (1) name remains. The one (1) remaining name shall be<br/>the arbitrator. The process of striking names shall occur within ten (10) days of receipt of the list.<br/>All grievances reaching the arbitration level shall be numbered consecutively during the current<br/>school year. The odd-numbered grievances will give the District first elimination; even-numbered<br/>grievances will give the Association first elimination. The order of striking will be reversed is an<br/>arbitration requires a second list of arbitrators.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the arbitrator has been selected, hearing shall commence at the convenience of the arbitrator.<br/>The arbitrator shall conduct the hearings in accordance with the voluntary arbitration rules of the<br/>American Arbitration Association and the provisions of this procedure.

<p>of the notice of dismissal or suspension to submit to the Governing Board a written request for a<br/>hearing. The failure of an employee to request a hearing within fifteen (15) days from receipt of<br/>a dismissal or suspension notice shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 19.0: Peer Assistance and Review Program (PAR) and Beginning<br/>Teacher Support and Assistance (BTSA)/lnduction Program</p>
<p>19.1 GUIDING PRINCIPLES</p>
<p>The La Mesa-Spring Valley Teachers Association (Association) and the La Mesa-Spring Valley School<br/>District (District) strive to provide the highest possible quality of education to La Mesa-Spring Valley<br/>students. Both parties agree that optimum student performance can best be achieved if there is a highly<br/>qualified teacher in every classroom. In order for students to succeed in learning, teachers must succeed in<br/>teaching. The parties believe that all teachers, from novice to the most experienced, must focus on<br/>continuous improvement in their professional practice. Accordingly, the parties agree to cooperate in the<br/>design and implementation of a professional development program to improve the quality of instruction<br/>through expanded and improved staff development, peer assistance, and professional accountability.</p>
<p>It is therefore the intent of the District and the Association to establish a Peer Assistance and Review<br/>(PAR) and Beginning Teacher Support and Assistance (BTSA)/Induction Program, which allows<br/>exemplary teachers to assist and support other teachers in the development of teaching strategies,<br/>curriculum enhancement, and quality of program. Additionally, the BTSA/Induction program provides<br/>training and support to help meet State of California credentialing requirements.</p>
<p>19.2 INDUCTION ADVISORY COUNCIL</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR and BTSA/Induction Program shall be administered by a joint council comprised of three (3)<br/>teachers and two (2) administrators and shall be called the Induction Advisory Council (IAC). The<br/>teacher appointees shall be designated by the Association Board and ratified by the representative<br/>council. The two (2) administrative representatives shall be appointed by the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IAC, by majority vote, will adopt guidelines for implementing the provisions of this Article. Said<br/>guidelines will be consistent with the provisions of the Agreement unless prohibited by law.</p>

Support Providers will have the same work day and year as specified in Article 4,<br/>Hours of Employment. It is the intent that Support Providers shall serve on a full-time basis and be<br/>released from their regular teaching assignment. However, as caseloads mandate, additional Part-<br/>time Release Support Providers may be needed. Support Provider assistance will include but is not<br/>limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discuss performance goals and objectives with the Participating Teacher.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist in developing an Individual Induction Plan (IIP) for BTSA/Induction<br/>Participating teacher.</p>

The IAC may<br/>remove a Support Provider from the position at any time because of the specific needs of the PAR and<br/>BTSA/Induction Programs, inadequate performance of the Support Provider, or for other reasons<br/>which serve the PAR and BTSA/Induction Program’s best interests. Prior to the effective date of such<br/>removal, the IAC will provide the Support Provider with a written statement of the reasons for the<br/>removal, and, at the request of the Support Provider, will meet with him/her to discuss the reasons.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of the Support Provider shall be five (5) years. A Support Provider who has served a five- (5)<br/>year term may reapply after returning to the classroom for two (2) years.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to their regular work year, Support Providers may be required to work up to an additional<br/>ten (10) days and receive per diem compensation, provided the days have been pre-approved by the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources, and recommended by the IAC.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of their assignment to the PAR and BTSA/Induction Program, a Support Provider<br/>will be given the same consideration for returning to the position of his/her last assignment as if he/she<br/>had remained in the classroom. However, the District reserves the right to reassign the employee to a<br/>position which will be most advantageous to the District, and in such instances the District will confer<br/>with the returning employee before such assignment is made.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to working with an Involuntary PAR Participating Teacher, the Support Provider will meet with<br/>the principal or immediate supervisor to review and discuss the basis for referral to the PAR Program.<br/>The PAR Program encourages a cooperative relationship between the Support Provider, Participating<br/>Teacher, and the principal with respect to the process of peer assistance and review.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who act as Support Providers pursuant to this Agreement shall have the same protection from<br/>liability and access to appropriate defense as other public school employees pursuant to California<br/>Government Code Section 810, et seq.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall modify or in any manner affect the rights of the District and/or Governing Board<br/>under provisions of the Education Code relating to the employment, classification, retention or non¬<br/>reelection of certificated employees.

<p>ARTICLE 20.0: Collaborative Practices</p>
<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTRACT WAIVERS</p>
<p>The Association and the District recognize that the continuing practices of the Total Quality Program and<br/>site restructuring may result in the seeking of waivers to the collective bargaining agreement. Waivers to<br/>this contract will be granted when a secret ballot election, conducted by the Association, shows seventy<br/>percent (70%) of the members participating in the vote support the proposed waiver. Such waivers are<br/>subject to an annual review.</p>

<p>20.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMM1JN1T1ES/MOD1F1ED DAY</p>
<p>The La Mesa Spring Valley Teachers Association and The School District are committed to excellence. The<br/>dedication of every employee has led to continuous improvement of all programs offered. In an effort to<br/>maintain this effort we jointly agree that the development of Professional Learning Communities is the<br/>appropriate next step. To ensure the proper and sustained development of this change we agree to implement<br/>and support the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District wide modified day</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff development on modified days as delineated in 20.4 A below</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training/ Staff Development on the concepts and practices of Professional Learning Communities</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrators or District shall use no more than ten (10) hours of modified day time.</p>
<p>These hours, commonly referred to as Site Learning Days (SLD), can be used by the District or<br/>sites for staff development or other activities.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time available for district/site use may be scheduled in two (2) hour blocks. Whenever a two-<br/>hour block is used, the next SLD that occurs immediately after such a block shall be duty free. The<br/>exception shall be as long as staff is aware of a scheduled two (2) hour block SLD at the beginning<br/>of the year, a different SLD (later in the year) can be duty free.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district will schedule the staff development dates when the school year calendar is<br/>published each year. Sites may waive the district-calendared dates to provide for local need.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modified days are generated through additional minutes taught each day. Therefore, unit<br/>members shall determine how to use modified days not being used for staff development subject<br/>to but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Meet in grade-level, cross-grade level, content and core specific teams to:</p>

<p>1. PLACEMENT ON RATIO SALARY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee continuing from the preceding school year, who is transferred from the certificated salary<br/>schedule to the ratio salary schedule, shall first have his/her salary determined on the appropriate class and step<br/>of the teachers’ salary schedule for the ensuing year in accordance with existing regulations. He/she shall then<br/>be placed at the appropriate ratio range of the ratio schedule on the basis of the assigned position and to the step<br/>within this ratio range which represents his/her experience credited.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A support or service personnel applicant new to the District shall be credited with up to ten (10) years total<br/>experience, teaching and equivalent combined, establishing a base salary on the appropriate step up to step<br/>eleven (11). The proper ratio step for years in the same support or service personnel position will then be<br/>applied to this base salary figure. Nonpublic school or college-level experience may be applied on the basis of<br/>two (2) years for one (1).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel may request permission to deviate from the designated work periods with the understanding that<br/>salary deductions for lesser periods of time worked will be computed on a basis commensurate with that<br/>amount paid on an annual daily rate. This same rule shall apply for extended service in a like capacity or<br/>assigned responsibility.</p>
<p>- 64 -</p>
<p>APPENDIX F</p>
<p>Extra Duty Compensation</p>
<p>The District recognizes that teachers may be assigned, on a voluntary basis, service beyond their professional<br/>commitment. Compensation for duties performed requires the prior approval of the principal/department manager.<br/>The following rates are compensation for services outside the contracted work schedule and responsibilities for<br/>certificated staff. This compensation is for duties clearly outside of the scope and responsibilities of Article 4.0 of<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective 2014-2015 school year, a class section of 50-100 minutes is considered 20 percent (20%) of the work</p>
<p>day and shall be compensated accordingly. A class section at LPMS is considered twenty-five percent (25%) of</p>
<p>the work day. An advisory period is considered ten percent (10%) of the work day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hourly Substitute Rates</p>
<p>Middle school (BUE) unit members who serve as substitutes during their preparation periods shall receive</p>
<p>additional compensation at the following rates of pay for each period of coverage:</p>
<p>The hourly equivalent of Column VI. Step 1 of the salary schedule = $52.36</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said hourly rates shall be calculated by establishing the daily rate by dividing the annual compensation by<br/>184 (the number of work days) then dividing the daily rate by five (5) (the number of teaching periods in a<br/>day).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substitute coverage rate of 1.5 x hourly rate will be paid for covering classes of more than sixty<br/>(60) minutes.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substitute coverage rate of .5 x hourly rate will be paid for covering classes of thirty (30) minutes or less.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following provisions shall apply:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each site shall develop and utilize a list of interested volunteers willing to provide substitute service.<br/>Volunteers may add their names to the end of the list or have their name deleted from the list at any time.<br/>Coverage will be given to volunteers first and be rotated equally through the list of volunteers. Volunteers<br/>who decline an assignment shall be moved to the end of the rotation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should no volunteer be available, the middle school principal may require service from a teacher on<br/>his/her preparation period. Such substitute service shall not be assigned more than four (4) times during the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall be assigned on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for Extra Pay (timesheets) will be submitted and paid monthly.</p>
<p>Activities that closely match the teaching day:</p>
<p>Tutorial/After School Classes. Teachers will receive seventy percent (70%) of their per diem rate, based<br/>on an eight- (8) hour day. However, the minimum hourly rate to be paid to teachers will be $29.48 per<br/>hour.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>Teacher A has a daily rate of $250 and hourly rate of $31.25 per hour: $250/8 = $31.25<br/>This rate is multiplied by 70% to determine the rate of pay: $31.25 x .70 = $21.88<br/>Teacher A’s rate is below the $29.48 minimum so Teacher A receives $29.48 per hour.</p>
<p>Teacher B has a daily rate of $400: $400/8 = $50.00<br/>$50.00 x .70 = $35.00<br/>The rate for Teacher B is $35.00 per hour</p>
<p>Assignments that provide for strategic planning, essential assessment, and presentation of staff development:</p>
<p>Curriculum Development &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$29.48</p>
<p>Presentations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$29.48</p>
<p>K Screening (7 hour minimum) $29.48<br/>Team/Departmental Planning $29.48</p>
<p>- 65 -</p>
<p>Summer School Rate Formula:</p>
<p>General Education:</p>
<p>Current Year Annual Salary x .075, Divided by 24 x .8125 = Daily Rate</p>
<p>Special Education:</p>
<p>(Per diem rate + 5 = hourly rate x 4.25 hours = Summer School Daily Rate<br/>Employee will receive Daily Rate times number of days worked.</p>
<p>Employee will not earn sick days, nor will they be paid for sick days used during summer school.</p>
<p>Lead teacher for Special Education Summer School receives an additional twenty percent (20%) of summer<br/>school daily rate.</p>
<p>Fall Intersession:</p>
<p>The current per diem pay includes compensation for lesson plans, instruction, assessment, record keeping<br/>and parent contact and supervision.</p>
<p>Teachers will not earn sick days, nor will they be paid for sick days used during intersession.</p>
<p>Teachers will only be paid for the contracted days worked.</p>
