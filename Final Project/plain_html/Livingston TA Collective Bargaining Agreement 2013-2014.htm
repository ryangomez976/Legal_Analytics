<p>Unit employees shall not be required to work under unsafe conditions or to perform tasks<br/>which endanger their health, safety, or well-being.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>ARTICLE X: LEAVE PROVISIONS</p>
<p>The benefits which are expressly provided by this section, Article X, are the sole benefits<br/>which are part of this Collective Agreement, and it is agreed that other statutory or regulatory<br/>leave benefits are not incorporated, either directly or by implication, into this Agreement, nor<br/>are such other benefits subject to the Grievance Procedure, Article XV.</p>
<p>As used in this article, “Immediate Family’' shall be limited to mother, father, grandmother,<br/>grandfather, or a grandchild of the unit employee or of the spouse of the unit employee, and<br/>the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, sister,<br/>sister-in-law, legal guardian, foster child of the unit employee or any relative living in the<br/>immediate household of the unit employee.</p>
<p>Salary Deduction for Unauthorized Leave: The unit employee’s daily salary for deduction<br/>purposes shall be compiled by dividing the employee’s salary by the number of scheduled<br/>work days.</p>
<p>Personal Illness and Injury Leave:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time unit employees shall be entitled to ten (10) days leave with full pay for<br/>each school year for purposes of personal illness or injury. Unit employees who<br/>work less than full-time shall be entitled to that portion of the ten (10) days leave as<br/>the number of hours per week of schedule duty relates to the number of hours for a<br/>full time unit employee in a comparable position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all earned leave, as set forth in D.l. above, is exhausted, additional<br/>nonaccumulated leave shall be available for a period not to exceed five (5) school<br/>months, provided that the provisions of D.4. below are met. The amount deducted<br/>for leave purposes from the unit employee’s salary shall be the amount actually paid<br/>a substitute employee employed to fill the position during the leave, or, if no<br/>substitute is employed, the amount which would have been paid to a substitute. The<br/>five (5) month period shall begin to run on the tenth (10th) day of absence due to<br/>illness or injury. In no event shall additional nonaccumulated leave, when combined<br/>with the leave authorized in D.l. above, exceed one hundred (100) days in any<br/>school year. Only one (1) such nonaccumulated leave shall be allowed for any single<br/>and continuous absence that extends into the next school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit employee does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in D.l.<br/>above in any school year, the amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year-to-<br/>year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request by District management, a unit employee shall be required to present a<br/>medical doctor’s certificate verifying the personal injury or illness and/or a medical<br/>authorization to return to work. If the illness or injury exceeds three (3) consecutive<br/>days, the District may require a medical statement as to the nature and severity of the</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>illness or injury. If the report concludes that the absence is not due to personal<br/>illness or injury, or that the illness is not sufficiently severe to warrant continued<br/>absence, then the Superintendent or designee, after notice to the unit employee, may<br/>refuse to grant such leave. If requested by District management, a unit employee<br/>shall not return to work until he/she submits a medical doctor’s authorization to<br/>return to work.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit employee must contact his/her immediate supervisor as<br/>soon as the need to be absent is known, but no less that two (2) hours prior to the<br/>start of the work day to permit the employer time to secure substitute service.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit employee who is absent for one-half (1/2) day or less shall have deducted<br/>one-half (1/2) day from the accumulated leave; and if the absence exceeds more than<br/>one-half (1/2) day, a full day shall be deducted from accumulated leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit employee shall not be allowed to return to work and shall be placed on leave<br/>without pay if the unit employee fails to notify the District of the unit employee’s<br/>intent to return to work at least two (2) hours prior to the close of the preceding work<br/>day.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave which is credited under D. 1. of the Article may be used, at the unit employee’s<br/>election, for purposes of personal necessity; provided that use of such personal<br/>necessity leave does not exceed seven (7) days in any school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this provision, personal necessity shall be limited to: (a) death or<br/>serious illness of a member of the unit employee’s immediate family; and (b) an<br/>accident which is unforeseen involving the unit employee’s person or property, or the<br/>person or property of a unit employee’s immediate family.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall grant four (4) days personal necessity leave credited under section</p>
<p>E.l. above, for the unit employee’s personal business without prior approval.<br/>Personal business shall not include any recreational or sports activities. When at all<br/>possible, prior notice shall be given to the site administrator at least twenty-four (24)<br/>hours before leave is taken. Leave granted under this section E.3 may be<br/>accumulated to a maximum of four (4) days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all circumstances, a unit employee shall verify in writing that the personal<br/>necessity leave was used only for purposes as set forth in E.2. and E.3. above.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit employee shall be entitled to a maximum of three (3) days leave of absence or<br/>five (5) days leave of absence if out-of-state travel, or travel of more than three<br/>hundred (300) miles is required, without loss of salary or deduction from other leave<br/>benefits in this article, on account of the death of any member of his/her immediate<br/>family.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit employee shall notify the District as soon as possible and also state the<br/>expected duration of the absence to enable the District to secure a substitute.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately upon return, a unit employee shall verify in writing that bereavement<br/>leave was used only for the puipose set forth in F. 1. above.</p>
<p>Leave for Pregnancy Disability</p>

<p>ARTICLE XV: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a good-faith allegation by a grievant that he/she has been adversely<br/>affected by a misinterpretation or violation of the specific provisions of the<br/>agreement. Action as to challenge or change the established policies of the District<br/>must be undertaken under separate legal processes. Other matters for which a<br/>specific method of review is provided by law, by the rules and regulations of the<br/>Board of Trustees, is not within the scope of this Procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” may be any unit employee(s) covered by the terms of this agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is any day in which unit employees are required to be on duty.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Immediate Supervisor” is the manager or supervisor having immediate<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant who has been designated by the District to administer<br/>grievances.</p>
<p>Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal grievance, the grievant should attempt to resolve it by an informal</p>
<p>conference with his immediate supervisors.</p>
<p>Formal Level (Level I - Step One)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the<br/>grievance, the grievant must present his grievance in writing on the appropriate<br/>District form to his immediate supervisor. This shall be a clear, concise statement of<br/>the grievance, including the specific provision of agreement, claimed to have been<br/>violated, the circumstances constituting such alleged violation, the decision rendered<br/>at the informal conference, and the specific remedy sought. The immediate<br/>supervisor shall communicate his decision to the unit employee in writing within ten<br/>(10) days after receiving the formal grievance. If the immediate supervisor does not<br/>respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limits, either party may request a personal conference.</p>
<p>Level II</p>
<p>1. If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, he may, within ten (10)<br/>days, appeal the decision on the appropriate District fomi to the Superintendent or his<br/>designee. This statement shall include a copy of the original grievance and appeal,<br/>the decisions rendered and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the appeal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his designee shall communicate his decision to the grievant<br/>within fifteen (15) days. If the Superintendent or his designee does not respond<br/>within the time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Process outlined in Level I and II of the Grievance Procedure, the grievant<br/>may submit in written letter form a request for the Livingston Union School District<br/>Board of Trustees to be the final arbitrator of his/her grievance. If this procedure is<br/>requested and the Board agrees to hear the grievant, the unit employee waives his/her<br/>right to binding arbitration as outlined in Level III. The Board decision to hear the<br/>grievance shall be acted upon at the next regular board meeting following the<br/>request.</p>
<p>Level III</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant believes the decision at Level II to be incorrect, he/she may, within<br/>five (5) days, submit a request in writing to the Association with a copy to the<br/>Superintendent for arbitration of the dispute. The Association may notify the<br/>Superintendent of its intent to submit the dispute to arbitration within fifteen (15)<br/>days of the grievant's request. The Association and the District shall attempt to<br/>agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement can be reached, they shall request the State<br/>Conciliation Service to supply a panel of five names of persons experienced in<br/>hearing grievances in public schools. Each party shall alternately strike a name until<br/>one name remains. The remaining panel member shall be the arbitrator. The order<br/>of striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne equally by the<br/>District and the grievant. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring<br/>them.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision of the<br/>issue or issues submitted to him. If the parties cannot agree upon a submission<br/>agreement, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written<br/>grievance and the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of this<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues arising out of the exercise by the Board and administration of its responsibility<br/>referred to in Article XVIII, Management Rights, including the facts underlying its<br/>exercise of such discretion shall not be subject to this procedure.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written<br/>arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties his decision which will<br/>be final and binding upon the parties. The arbitrator shall have no power to award<br/>more than $50,000 per grievance.</p>
