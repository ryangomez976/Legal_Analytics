<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the sole and exclusive right to District payroll deduction for</p>
<p>membership dues and service fees.

Upon<br/>certification to the District that the Association has complied with the requirements of<br/>State and Federal law related to notification of non-member rights, deductions for service<br/>fees shall begin no later than the end of the month following the month in which the<br/>authorization is received by the District.</p>
<p>3</p>

In-lieu contributions made<br/>pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be transmitted to the designated<br/>organization in the same manner. A list of employees and status, (e.g.,<br/>member, fee payer, in-lieu payer) shall accompany each monthly<br/>transmittal.</p>
<p>3.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deductions for unit members who sign such authorization after the<br/>commencement of the school year shall be appropriately prorated to<br/>complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>

<p>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may require that proof of such payments be made on an annual<br/>basis as a condition of continued exemption from the requirement of financial<br/>support to the Association. If an employee who holds conscientious objections<br/>pursuant to this section requests that the Association use the grievance procedure<br/>on the employee's behalf, the Association is authorized to charge the employee for<br/>the reasonable cost of using the procedure.</p>
<p>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizations specified pursuant to paragraph 3.2 are:</p>

<p>ARTICLE IV<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions:</p>
<p>4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is an allegation by a grievant that he or she has been adversely<br/>affected by an interpretation, violation, or misapplication of the specific<br/>provisions of this Agreement. An action to challenge or change the terms of this<br/>Agreement shall not be considered a grievance.</p>
<p>4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is a member of the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement who<br/>files a grievance or the Association.</p>
<p>4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is any working day in which the District administrative office is open for<br/>business.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Information:</p>
<p>4.2.1 In the event the District fails to adhere to any decision deadline set forth in this<br/>Article, the grievant shall have the right to appeal automatically to the next step<br/>(higher level). Failure of the unit member to adhere to any submission deadline<br/>shall mean that the unit member accepts the Districts decision and waives any<br/>right to further appeal. However, deadlines in this Article may be extended by<br/>mutual written agreement of the grievant and the District.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of a grievance takes place, the grievant is required to<br/>conform to the original direction of his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>4.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately<br/>from the official personnel files of the participants except a final decision<br/>rendered pursuant to this article.</p>
<p>4.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member whose presence (whether as a grievant, representative,<br/>or witness) is necessary during his/her working hours at any mutually scheduled<br/>meeting, conference or hearing required by this Article shall, upon notice to<br/>his/her immediate management supervisor, be released without loss of pay.</p>
<p>4.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant may terminate his/her grievance at any time by giving written notice to<br/>the District. Failure to comply with time limits, to attend scheduled meetings<br/>relating to the grievance, or to provide requested information at the grievant’s<br/>disposal relating to the subject matter of the grievance shall be deemed a<br/>termination of the grievance by the unit member. The District shall be required to<br/>give written notice of such termination to the unit member.</p>
<p>4.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When possible, the District shall schedule meetings regarding the grievance at<br/>times that do not interfere with instructional time.</p>
<p>4.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievant shall have his or her identity and grievance kept confidential.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Resolution of Grievances:</p>
<p>4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who believes he or she has a grievance shall present the concern<br/>orally to the immediate management supervisor within fifteen (15) days after the<br/>grievant knew, or reasonably should have known, of the circumstances which<br/>form the basis for the grievance. Failure to do so within the time period specified<br/>above renders the grievance null and void. The supervisor shall hold a discussion<br/>with the unit member in order to attempt to resolve the concern.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Resolution of Grievances:</p>
<p>4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 1. If the unit member’s concern is not resolved during the informal<br/>discussion and the unit member wishes to pursue the matter, the unit member<br/>shall present the grievance to the immediate management supervisor in writing,<br/>on forms provided by the District, within ten (10) days after the oral decision by<br/>the supervisor based on the informal discussion. The written grievance shall<br/>include:</p>
<p>a. A description of the specific grounds of the grievance, including</p>
<p>names, dates, and places necessary for a complete understanding of the<br/>grievance;</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the specific provisions of this Agreement which are<br/>alleged to have been violated or misapplied;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the reasons why the supervisor’s proposed resolution of<br/>the problem is unacceptable; and</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of specific actions requested of the District, which will<br/>remedy the grievance.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after the receipt of the written grievance, the supervisor shall<br/>investigate the grievance and give his/her decision in writing to the grievant.</p>
<p>4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2. If the grievance issue is denied at Step 1, he or she may appeal the<br/>decision within five (5) days to the Superintendent or his/her designee.<br/>The appeal shall include a copy of the original grievance, the decision<br/>rendered at Step 1, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the<br/>appeal. Within fifteen (15) days after the Step 2 appeal is filed, the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee shall investigate the grievance and give<br/>issue a decision in writing to the grievant.</p>
<p>4.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 3. If the grievance is denied at Step 2 the grievant, the grievant shall<br/>have the right to appeal the matter to the Board within five (5) days of the<br/>decision rendered by the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>The Board may set the grievance for hearing within a reasonable time but not less<br/>than ten (10) days following the grievant’s appeal to the Board. The decision of<br/>the Board shall be final.</p>
<p>4.5 Representation: A unit member may request an Association representative to be present<br/>at any step of the grievance procedure. The grievant shall be present at each step of the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>4.5.1 If the District schedules a meeting regarding the grievance during the<br/>instructional time of the grievant, a Designated Association representative<br/>shall receive time off without loss of compensation for the purpose of<br/>processing grievances beyond the informal level, subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>4.5.1.1 No later than fourteen (14) days following the ratification of this<br/>Agreement, the Association shall designate in writing to the<br/>Superintendent no more than two (2) unit members who shall be<br/>entitled to time off as Association grievance representatives.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>4.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative shall notify the District at least twenty-four (24)<br/>hours prior to release from duties in order that a substitute may be<br/>obtained, unless a conference is scheduled between the grievant<br/>and the administration with less than twenty-four (24) hours notice<br/>to the grievant.</p>
<p>4.5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such time shall be limited solely to accompany the grievant for a<br/>conference with a management person and in no way shall include<br/>the use of time for matters such as gathering information,<br/>interviewing witnesses or preparing presentations.</p>
<p>4.5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant shall be represented by no more than one Association<br/>representative per grievance.</p>
<p>ARTICLE V<br/>LEAVES</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provision: Any statutory or regulatory leave benefits not addressed in this<br/>Agreement are not subject to Article IV, “Grievance Procedure.”</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Illness and Injury Leave:</p>
<p>5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who work full time shall be entitled to ten (10) days leave<br/>of absence for illness or injury with full pay for each year of service. A<br/>unit member who receives remuneration for less than a full regular year of<br/>service shall be entitled to that proportion of ten (10) days of sick leave as<br/>his/her actual remuneration for a year of service bears to the amount<br/>he/she would have received for a full regular year of service.</p>
<p>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has utilized all of his or her current and accumulated sick<br/>leave and is absent from his or her duties on account of illness or injury,<br/>the unit member shall be entitled to differential pay for a period not to<br/>exceed five (5) school months, provided that the provisions of paragraph</p>
<p>5.2.4 below are met. The five-month period shall begin on the first day<br/>following the exhaustion of the unit member’s current and accumulated<br/>sick leave. The amount deducted from the unit member’s salary under this<br/>provision shall not exceed the amount actually paid a substitute employee<br/>employed to fill the position during the leave, or, if no substitute is<br/>employed, the amount which would have been paid to a substitute. The<br/>differential pay leave provided under this provision does not accrue from<br/>year to year.</p>
<p>5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in<br/>paragraph 5.2.1 above in any school year, the amount not utilized shall be<br/>accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>5.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request by District Administration, a unit member shall be required<br/>to present a medical doctor’s certificate verifying the personal illness or<br/>injury and/or a medical authorization to return to work. If the illness or<br/>injury exceeds three (3) consecutive days, the District Administration may<br/>require a certified medical specialist to visit or otherwise contact the unit<br/>member and make all necessary inquiries in order to be fully informed as<br/>to the nature and severity of the illness or injury, and to report such<br/>findings to the Superintendent or his/her designee. If the report concludes<br/>that the absence is not due to personal illness or injury, or that the illness is<br/>not sufficiently severe to warrant continued absence, then the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, after notice to the unit member, may<br/>refuse to grant such leave. If requested by the District Administration, a<br/>unit member shall not return to work until he or she submits a medical<br/>doctor’s authorization to return to work.</p>
<p>5.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit member must contact his or her immediate<br/>supervisor as soon as the need to be absent is known, but in no event less<br/>than two (2) hours prior to the start of the work day to permit the employer<br/>time to secure a substitute. Failure to provide adequate notice shall be<br/>grounds for denial of leave with pay or for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>5.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is absent for 1 to 2 hours shall have deducted one-<br/>third day from his or her accumulated leave; if the absence exceeds two<br/>hours and is less than three-and-three-quarter hours, one-half day shall be<br/>deducted; if the absence is three-and-three-quarter hours or more, a full<br/>day shall be deducted.</p>
<p>5.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not be allowed to return to work and shall be placed<br/>on leave without pay if the unit member fails to notify the District of the<br/>unit member’s intent to return to work at least two (2) hours prior to the<br/>close of the preceding work day if such failure results in a substitute being<br/>secured.</p>
<p>5.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall be notified of the amount of his or her<br/>accumulated leave by no later than September 10 of each school year.</p>
<p>5.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid “family care leave” may be requested for up to twelve (12) weeks<br/>in a one-year period for (1) the birth or adoption of an employee’s child;</p>
<p>(2) the placement of a foster child with the employee; or (3) the serious<br/>health condition of an employee’s family member. Family members shall<br/>include spouse, child, legal ward, adult dependent child, parent, or any<br/>person with whom the employee has an “in loco parentis” relationship.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>5.2.10 Unpaid “medical leave” may be requested for up to twelve (12) weeks in a<br/>one-year period for an employee’s own serious health condition.</p>
<p>5.3 Personal Necessity Leave:</p>
<p>5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use up to seven (7) days of accumulated sick leave<br/>during each school year for purposes of personal necessity , one of them<br/>being a “no tell” day (see 5.3.4). Personal necessity is defined as any of<br/>the circumstances listed below:</p>
<p>5.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the unit member’s<br/>immediate family as defined in paragraph 5.4.1 below;</p>
<p>5.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving the unit member’s person or property, or the<br/>person or property of a unit member’s immediate family as defined<br/>in paragraph 5.4.1 below; or</p>
<p>5.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other personal necessity allowed at the discretion of the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, provided that under no<br/>circumstances shall leave be available for purposes of personal<br/>convenience, for the extension of a holiday or vacation period, for<br/>matters which can be taken care of outside work hours, or for<br/>recreational or political activities.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the utilization of personal necessity leave a unit member must<br/>obtain prior written approval from the Superintendent or his/her designee,<br/>except for leave taken due to the circumstances described in paragraphs</p>
<p>5.3.1.1 or 5.3.1.2 above. Requests for such leave shall be submitted to the<br/>office of the Superintendent not less than two (2) work days prior to the<br/>date of the requested leave. Should the circumstances described in<br/>paragraphs 5.3.1.1 or 5.3.1.2 arise, the unit member shall make every<br/>effort to comply with District procedures to enable the District to secure a<br/>substitute.</p>
<p>5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under all circumstances a unit member shall verify in writing that the<br/>personal necessity leave was used only for purposes set forth in paragraph<br/>above. If it was not, the leave will be denied and the unit member may be<br/>subject to appropriate discipline if the leave was used for purposes other<br/>than stipulated.</p>
<p>5.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may use at his/her election, one personal necessity leave<br/>day without the restrictions listed above, except that requests for such<br/>leave be submitted to the office of the superintendent no less than two (2)</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>days prior to the date of the requested leave. Under no circumstances shall<br/>such leave be available for the extension of a holiday or vacation period.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave:</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to a maximum of three (3) days paid leave<br/>of absence, or a maximum of five (5) days of paid leave if the unit<br/>member travels a minimum of 325 miles one-way, on account of the death<br/>of any member of his or her immediate family. The term “immediate<br/>family” as used in this Agreement means mother, father, grandmother,<br/>grandfather, or grandchild of the unit member or of the spouse of the unit<br/>member, and the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law,<br/>brother or sister of the unit member, or any person living in the immediate<br/>household of the employee.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may request permission of their immediate supervisor to be<br/>absent without pay on account of the death of any relative not designated<br/>as immediate family.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member taking bereavement leave shall notify the District of the<br/>expected duration of the leave.</p>
<p>5.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the District suspects that a unit member has abused the leave<br/>privileges provided herein, the District may request verification, including,<br/>but not limited to, death certificate, notice of death, or receipts evidencing<br/>travel to a destination at least 325 miles away.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave:</p>
<p>5.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to use sick leave as set forth in paragraphs 5.2.2<br/>and 5.2.3 for disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery. The beginning and ending date of<br/>the leave shall be determined by the employees attending physician or<br/>practitioner and shall be provided to the District in writing. This leave<br/>shall not be used for childcare, child rearing, or preparation for child<br/>bearing, but shall be limited to those disabilities as set forth above.</p>
<p>5.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to leave without pay or other benefits for<br/>disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth,<br/>and recovery there from when sick leave as set forth in paragraphs 5.2.1<br/>and 5.2.2 has been exhausted.</p>
<p>5.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who takes pregnancy disability leave shall be entitled to<br/>return to a position comparable to that held at the time the leave<br/>commenced.</p>
<p>11</p>

<p>The medical certification for leave for the unit member’s own serious health<br/>condition shall include (a) the date on which the serious health condition<br/>commenced; (b) the probable duration of the condition; (c) a statement that, due<br/>to the serious health condition, the unit member is unable to perform the functions<br/>of his/her position; and (d) in the case of intermittent or reduced schedule leave<br/>where medically necessary, the probable duration of such a schedule. In addition,<br/>the certification may, at the unit member’s option, identify the nature of the<br/>serious health condition involved. The District may require the unit member to<br/>obtain a second opinion from a doctor of the District’s choosing at the District’s<br/>expense. If the unit member’s health care provider and the doctor providing the<br/>second opinion do not agree, the District may require a third opinion, also at the<br/>District’s expense, performed by a mutually agreeable doctor who will make a<br/>final determination.</p>
<p>5.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall first exhaust his/her sick leave where the leave is<br/>for the unit member’s own serious health condition and may use accrued<br/>sick leave with consent of the District for other conditions warranting<br/>family care leave.</p>
<p>5.8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any paid leave(s) used for the purpose of this section shall run concurrent<br/>with, and shall reduce, the total of twelve (12) weeks of Family Care/<br/>Medical Leave on a day-for-day basis.</p>

Unit members who do not<br/>return from Family Care/Medical Leave for reasons other than their own<br/>disability shall be responsible for reimbursing the District for the health<br/>plan premium costs during the period(s) of the leave, unless the unit<br/>member was in paid status during the entire leave.</p>
<p>5.8.9 Except in emergencies, all requests for Family Care Leave must be<br/>submitted at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance. All requests are<br/>subject to verification of need. The specific starting and ending dates of<br/>the leave shall be coordinated with the needs of the District and are subject<br/>to approval by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>5.8.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Care/Medical Leave shall not constitute a break in service<br/>for longevity or seniority purposes, but a unit member shall not<br/>earn credit for sick leave during unpaid Family Care/Medical<br/>Leave.</p>
<p>5.8.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be restored to the same or an equivalent<br/>position upon return from Family Care/Medical Leave.</p>
<p>5.8.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Family Care Leave shall be in accordance with<br/>Federal and State law, and any changes thereto.</p>
<p>5.8.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, a unit member<br/>may use in any calendar year the unit member’s accrued and<br/>available sick leave entitlement, in an amount not less than the sick<br/>leave that would be accrued during six months at the current rate of<br/>entitlement, to attend to the illness of the unit member’s child,<br/>parent or spouse. All conditions and restrictions placed by the<br/>District upon a unit member’s use of sick leave shall also apply to<br/>the use by a unit member of sick leave to attend to an illness of<br/>his/her child, parent or spouse.
