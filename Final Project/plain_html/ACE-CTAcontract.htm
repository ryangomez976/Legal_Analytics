<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to Join</p>
<p>The Office agrees that every unit member employed in the bargaining unit shall have the right to freely support<br/>and/or join or not to join the Association for the purpose of engaging in collective bargaining or negotiations<br/>with the Office. The Office undertakes and agrees that it shall not directly discourage, deprive, or coerce any<br/>unit member in the enjoyment of any rights implied by the cited government codes or other laws in California,<br/>the Constitution of California, or that of the United States.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guaranteed Rights</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members Rights</p>
<p>All rights guaranteed unit members under all codes and laws, whether local, state, or federal pertaining to<br/>education, including those concerning policies on non-discrimination, academic freedom, controversial<br/>issues, freedom of speech, adverse action, personal life, recording devices, and unit member interview<br/>procedures wherein reference is made to membership in or preference for an employee organization, shall<br/>apply to unit members; however, such codes and laws shall not be grievable unless the substance of the<br/>law is also a negotiated section of this Agreement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Discrimination</p>
<p>The Office reaffirms that it shall not unlawfully discriminate against employees on the basis of race, color,<br/>creed, age, sex, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, or disability as defined by state and<br/>federal law. An employee may seek redress of an alleged act of discrimination through the grievance<br/>process and procedure included in this Agreement; however, if an alleged discrimination charge is filed<br/>with a governmental agency or court of law, the grievance shall be placed in abeyance until the<br/>governmental agency has finished processing the charge or one (1) year has elapsed, whichever comes<br/>first. If the grievance is in abeyance, the timelines are considered tolled.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Discrimination on Account of Association Activity</p>
<p>The Office affirms that bargaining unit employees shall not be discriminated against because of protected<br/>Association activities. The Office recognizes that the grievance procedure contained in this Agreement<br/>may be utilized if a bargaining unit employee alleges an act of discrimination based on Association<br/>membership or lawful Association activities.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Names of Unit Members</p>
<p>The Office shall, by October 15<sup>th</sup> of each school year, furnish to the Association, without charge, an accurate list<br/>of unit members by name, home address, and current work site unless that unit member has requested the<br/>Office, in writing, not to disclose the home address to the Association. The Office shall send a copy of those</p>
<p>ACE/CTA/NEA Agreement</p>
<p>written requests to the Association. Once such a written request is made, the Office shall comply with Board<br/>Policy and any applicable law with respect to the release of home addresses. The Office shall continue to<br/>provide the Association with the monthly personnel status report including name changes, site changes, and<br/>changes of address by the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month. The Association agrees to use such information for internal<br/>organizational purposes only and agrees not to disclose this information to a third party.</p>

<p>All Association business, discussions, and activities shall be conducted by unit members or Association officials<br/>outside established work hours as defined in Article 13, Hours, herein: lunch, breaks, prep periods, or outside<br/>of work hours. Said business shall be conducted in places other than Office property except when an<br/>authorized Association representative obtains advance permission from the site manager or designee regarding<br/>the specific time, place, and type of activity to be conducted. In such cases, the Association shall be responsible<br/>for security, clean-up, and any expenses involving unusual wear or damage resulting from Association use.</p>
<p>The Office will make every effort not to schedule mandatory meetings for members on the first and second<br/>Thursday of each month. Nothing in this agreement precludes the teacher from scheduling IEP meetings on<br/>these days.</p>

<p>In order to conform with the U.S. Supreme Court decision governing postal regulations and union use of an<br/>employer's internal mail system, the Association may not use the internal mail system (pony) except for joint<br/>Association-Office communications.</p>
<p>The Association may use the school mailboxes and bulletin board spaces designated by the immediate<br/>supervisor of the person distributing notices, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All postings for bulletin boards or items for school mailboxes must identify the date of posting or<br/>distribution and the name of the organization.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A notice or copy of each posting or distribution must be delivered to the immediate supervisor at the<br/>time of posting or distribution.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board Meetings</p>
<p>One unit member shall be given release time to attend scheduled meetings of the Santa Clara County Board of<br/>Education. Said member shall be selected by the Association on a quarterly basis and his/her name shall be<br/>forwarded to the Chief Human Resources Officer and/or designee.</p>
<p>ACE/CTA/NEA Agreement</p>
<p>The President of the Association shall receive one (1) copy of the complete agenda and minutes of all Board of<br/>Education meetings with the exception of minutes of closed sessions or other confidential communications or<br/>materials. The Association representative may address any items on the Board agenda in the manner and<br/>procedure provided by applicable Board policies.</p>
<p>4.7 Access to Materials</p>
<p>The Association shall also have reasonable access, in accordance with Board policy to other lawful and non-<br/>confidential materials necessary to conduct lawful Association business such as, but not limited to, the Office<br/>budget.</p>

<p>Classroom Observation</p>
<p>The classroom observation is a personal observation of a unit member serving as a classroom teacher by<br/>the unit member's primary evaluator or other administrator (a principal, a program manager or a program<br/>director).

<p>8.3 Persons Subject to Evaluation</p>
<p>a. Every permanent unit member who has been employed by the Office for ten (10) or more years, who is<br/>highly qualified under 20 U.S.C. 78901 (No Child Left Behind) and whose previous evaluation was</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>ACE/CTA/NEA Agreement</p>
<p>satisfactory (meeting or exceeding standards) shall be evaluated by his/her primary evaluator at least once<br/>every five (5) years. A unit member who has transferred to a different work site from the site where the<br/>unit member was based in the preceding year will ordinarily be subject to evaluation even if the unit<br/>member was evaluated during the preceding year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every permanent unit member who has been employed by the Office for less than ten (10) years shall be<br/>evaluated by his/her primary evaluator at least once every other school year. A unit member who has<br/>transferred to a different work site from the site where the unit member was based in the preceding year<br/>will ordinarily be subject to evaluation even if the unit member was evaluated during the preceding year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every temporary, probationary and non-tenured certificated employee (e.g. nurses, counselors, ROP<br/>teachers and other non-classroom teachers) and any permanent employee who received an overall<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation during the previous year, shall be evaluated by his/her primary evaluator in<br/>writing at least once a year.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basis for Evaluation</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members who received a satisfactory evaluation in the preceding school year are not<br/>required to submit goals and objectives. The primary evaluator shall schedule a conference with the unit<br/>member no later than November 1<sup>st</sup> for the purpose of jointly developing objectives relating to the areas<br/>of evaluation set forth in Section 8.4. The objectives shall be developed jointly. Every objective is<br/>important, and the evaluatee is expected to work toward achievement of each objective; however, the<br/>evaluator and evaluatee may agree to focus on one or more of the objectives during that particular school<br/>year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference between the evaluator and evaluatee requires a face-to-face meeting, during which a good<br/>faith effort will be made to reach agreement on the evaluatee's objectives. If the evaluator and evaluatee<br/>fail to agree on the development of any objectives, an appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days of the<br/>meeting between the evaluator and evaluatee and discussed with the program director. The program<br/>director's decision will be final.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member receives an overall unsatisfactory evaluation, the unit member shall be referred to the<br/>PAR program to work with a consulting teacher in accordance with the provisions of Article 25. In addition,<br/>the evaluator shall prepare a written teacher assistance program with specific timelines and strategies.<br/>These timelines and strategies which are developed shall be appropriate to each individual situation.<br/>Factors which may impact the situation may include, but are not limited to, severity of the situation and<br/>availability of resources.

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date by which deficiencies and performance must be corrected</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member and the evaluator will have a face-to-face meeting to discuss and review the teacher<br/>assistance plan before it is implemented. At the agreed-upon reassessment period, the unit member and<br/>the evaluator will have another meeting to reassess the progress of the unit member. At that time the<br/>evaluator may require the unit member to continue on a teacher assistance plan or may notify the unit<br/>member that the unit member has progressed to the point that he/she no longer requires a teacher<br/>assistance plan.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher assistance plan may include, but shall not be limited to: weekly meetings with the evaluator<br/>to review the unit member's lesson plans, having an administrator or peer coach model a lesson for the<br/>unit member, providing the unit member with release time to observe another class, or attendance at in-<br/>service training or other applicable courses.

If the administrator investigating the incident concludes there is no<br/>basis for the allegations, no reprimand will be placed in the file. If the administrator concludes there is a basis<br/>for the allegation, despite the unit member's denial, the reprimand shall be placed in the personnel file after<br/>the unit member has been shown the reprimand and given an opportunity to attach a rebuttal within ten (10)<br/>days.</p>
<p>Letters of reprimand shall be placed in the personnel file rather than in the evaluation folder and do not need<br/>to be held until the end of the evaluation period; however, an incident which is both misconduct and<br/>performance-related may be referred to in the summative evaluation as well as in the letter of reprimand<br/>provided the unit member has been provided the right to review and comment on the material. <sup>21</sup></p>

<p>ARTICLE 12 - TRANSFER. REASSIGNMENT. MODIFICATION. POSITION CHANGE</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer refers to action which results in a movement of a unit member from one site to another within<br/>the same Office-approved job description. A transfer may be Office initiated or employee initiated.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassignment is a change in age/grade level, a change in subject matter, or in functioning level of<br/>students at the same site, or movement from one Office-approved job description to another. A<br/>reassignment may be Office initiated or employee initiated.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assignment modification is the addition/deletion of classes and/or sites made to the existing<br/>assignment during the school year.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Transfers, Reassignments, and Assignment Modifications</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer, reassignment, or assignment modification of a unit member may become necessary to meet<br/>workload, conditions, instructional requirements, facility changes, or for other valid reasons.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members shall be given notice of their site, class, subject, building and room assignment for the<br/>forthcoming year no later than May 15<sup>th</sup>. In cases where facilities or budgets have not been finalized, unit<br/>members shall be notified of these problems by June 15<sup>th</sup>, and assignments shall be made at least fifteen<br/>(15) calendar days prior to the commencing of their assignment for the year. If there are unforeseen<br/>facility difficulties and the unit member is informed after June 15<sup>th</sup>, but before the fifteen (15) calendar-day<br/>minimum for assignments, a letter outlining the difficulties shall be included with the assignment. The<br/>Office will notify the unit member and may transfer, reassign, or modify the assignment of the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative transfers, reassignments, or assignment modifications may be made for any of the<br/>following reasons:</p>
<p>1. If the enrollment of a school does not meet the projection by September 30<sup>th</sup>, or decreases at any<br/>time to the extent that the number of assigned unit members must be reduced, the process shall take<br/>place in the following priority:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term substitutes or temporary employees are to be transferred first;</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Office will ask for volunteers;</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no volunteers, the least senior (based on Office-wide seniority) probationary or<br/>permanent employee at the site next; <sup>26</sup></p>
<p>26</p>
<p>ACE/CTA/NEA Agreement</p>
<p>d) If there are specific grade level or subject field needs, then the principal or program manager may<br/>designate the least senior unit member assigned to the grade level or subject area that shall be<br/>transferred or reassigned, or assigned a position change.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who has received a formal evaluation of weak or unsatisfactory service in any position<br/>may be transferred, reassigned, or his/her assignment modified in order to provide a reasonable<br/>opportunity for improvement. However, the possibility of such a transfer, reassignment, or<br/>assignment modification must be discussed with the individual at the time of the evaluation. In<br/>addition, the evaluator must specify how a specific change will be expected to aid in the improvement<br/>of the unit member's performance and shall notify the unit member of this in writing.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a new site or program is opened, transfers, reassignments, or assignment modifications may be<br/>based on the needs of the new site or program.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be transferred, reassigned, or his/her assignment modified if the new site or<br/>program has greater need of his/her specialized service than does his/her current site or program of<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a lease is not renewed, a site is closed or available space is reduced, a unit member(s) may be<br/>transferred. If available space is reduced or there is a staffing overage for any reason, the Office will<br/>first ask for volunteers. If there are no volunteers, the Office will transfer the least senior employee at<br/>the site (based on Office-wide seniority) whose transfer will not impact the program based on the<br/>employee's credential.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a transfer, assignment modification, or reassignment by the principal, coordinator or program<br/>manager has been decided upon, the unit member involved shall be notified in writing immediately of the<br/>reasons for the transfer, assignment modification or reassignment by the principal, coordinator, or<br/>program manager. The unit member has the right to meet and discuss his/her objections with the<br/>principal, coordinator, or program manager. These objections shall also be presented in writing. If no<br/>mutual agreement is reached, the unit member has the right to appeal to the department head.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be transferred or reassigned or his/her assignment modified at any time, if it does not<br/>impose an unreasonable hardship upon the unit member. However, any unit member contending that a<br/>particular transfer, assignment, modification, or reassignment would be an unreasonable hardship shall file<br/>a written appeal with the department head. The department head shall set up a meeting with the unit<br/>member, a representative of the Association, and any other witness who could provide testimony or<br/>information that would prove helpful to the resolution of the dispute. The decision of the department<br/>head shall be final, in writing and addressed to the principal parties. The transfer, assignment<br/>modification, or reassignment shall not take place until after the department head has rendered a<br/>decision.</p>
<p>ACE/CTA/NEA Agreement</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for unit members receiving a transfer or reassignment shall be:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is moved due to a transfer or reassignment, whether voluntary or involuntary, the<br/>unit member and the Principal of the site where the unit member is assigned before the transfer will<br/>meet to review the Transfer Flow Chart and to reach agreement on the timing of the transfer, the<br/>equipment and materials that must be moved and the amount of time for which the teacher will be<br/>compensated for work outside of normal hours, based on the guidelines in the Transfer Flow chart.<br/>Each move will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties will try to minimize disruption to the instructional process while implementing the<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will be compensated for moves that occur beyond the work day at the hourly rate of<br/>$40.00 for hours needed to complete the move.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member and the Principal do not agree to terms of the transfer, the dispute will be<br/>submitted to the Chief Fluman Resources Officer, whose decision shall be final.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Office will provide packing boxes, custodial help and IT help as needed.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moves Due to Remodeling</p>
<p>The parties recognize that certain classes will be moved out of their facilities temporarily during<br/>remodeling and then moved back. Although remodeling is an issue separate from at* involuntary transfer;<br/>therefore, the procedures in Section 12.2(f) will apply as needed. The principal and the teacher will work<br/>on a plan to manage the packing, moving, and unpacking based on the needs of the site and the program.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who submit transfer requests by February 28<sup>th</sup> shall be given priority consideration during the<br/>period from March 1<sup>st</sup> to March 15<sup>th</sup>; however, if there are layoffs of unit members, voluntary transfer<br/>requests will not be considered until after a bid board is held for employees whose positions have been<br/>eliminated, but who are not being laid off due to seniority. If more than one (1) employee requests a<br/>transfer to a particular vacancy, the Office will consider the employee's credentials, qualifications,<br/>experience and skills. If those factors are substantially equal, the most senior employee (based on Office¬<br/>wide seniority) shall be given first consideration.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Office may fill positions from requests received during the Open Transfer Period without going<br/>through the interview process. This includes vacancies created by the movement of unit members during<br/>the Open Transfer Period.</p>

<p>And</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY EDUCATORS/CTA/NEA</p>
<p>Re: Stipend for Verification Process for Special Settings (VPSS)</p>
<p>Santa Clara County Office of Education is required to have our teachers Highly Qualified under<br/>No Child Left Behind (NCLB). One avenue teachers may pursue to become Highly Qualified<br/>under the Advanced Certification Process is the Verification Process for Special Settings or<br/>VPSS. This Advanced Certification requires teachers to attend 36 hours of class for Tier 1 and<br/>another 36 hours of class for Tier II. The Los Angeles County Office of Education offers classes<br/>on-line in Social Studies, Science, Math, and English. SCCOE will offer in-person classes in<br/>Math.</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage teachers to take advantage of this certification process, the Office will,<br/>during the 2013-2014 school year:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-pay the tuition costs for the course ($550 per tier for in-person math or S400<br/>per tier for on-line classes).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensate teachers for time spent attending class outside the workday at a rate<br/>of $40/hour for a maximum of 36 hours. Compensation will be paid only after the<br/>teacher satisfactorily completes the entire 36 hour course.</p>
<p>If a teacher wishes to receive unit credit toward salary advancement, he/she must notify the<br/>Director of Human Resources in writing prior to attending the first class. I'hese teachers will not<br/>receive compensation and must pay the tuition cost as well as applicable college credit fees,<br/>Teachers shall not cam salary schedule credit or extra compensation for classes attended during<br/>their normal working hours. Credit and compensation will only be offered for VPSS classes<br/>taught or approved by SCCOE. Teachers to whom NCLB certification docs not apply may<br/>enroll in VPSS classes at their expense. No compensation will be offered for those teachers.</p>
<p>This agreement shall remain in effect during the 2013-2014 school year through September 2014<br/>and may be extended, by mutual agreement, for the remainder of the 2014-2015 school year.<br/>This agreement shall not constitute a precedent for future trainings or other work outside of the<br/>scope of negotiated work hours.</p>
