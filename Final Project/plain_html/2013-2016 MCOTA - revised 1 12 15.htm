<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has the right to resolve a grievance below Level Two, without Association<br/>intervention, provided the adjudication of the grievance is consistent with the terms of this</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Agreement and the Association receives a copy of the proposed settlement and has an<br/>opportunity to state its views prior to the implementation of the decision,</p>

Credit will be given for related work experience and/or related managerial experience.<br/>Each year's credits will be limited to one kind of experience.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hire, continued experience may be credited, provided that prior approval has been<br/>obtained from the CAE Assistant Superintendent and that the experience provides a basis for<br/>professional growth and development of the teacher.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) year of experience will be defined as one (1) year of verifiable calendar experience<br/>during which the teacher worked a minimum of 1,500 hours in the vocational field for which</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>he/she is credentialed; or the accumulation of 1,500 hours of verifiable experience in the<br/>vocational field for which he/she is credentialed, accumulated over a period of more than one</p>
<p>(1) calendar year.</p>

Attendance and participation in technical development seminars which are directly related to the<br/>teacher's specific teaching area will equal one (1) semester unit for each two (2) day seminar or<br/>conference.

For credit to be granted, prior<br/>approval must be obtained from the CAE Assistant Superintendent and attendance or<br/>participation must be at the expense of the employee.

<p>35</p>
<p>obtaining an authorized signature on a standardized letter of verification provided by the ROP<br/>staff.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When not otherwise available, credit equal to semester units can be earned in approved business-<br/>industry inservice training. As such business-industry training is approved, a composite list will<br/>be made for the teacher's reference. The inservice training with professional credit must be<br/>judged by the Career and Alternative Education Assistant Superintendent as being for the primary<br/>purpose of improving the competency of the teacher to teach in his/her field. In the event of a<br/>disagreement between the CAE Assistant Superintendent and the teacher with regard to the value<br/>of a proposed inservice or professional growth seminar, the CAE Assistant Superintendent will<br/>seek the advice of the advisory committee. The inservice training or professional growth should<br/>include workshops or actual related work experience (emphasizing current and new trends and<br/>technology) in respective subject through which college credit is normally not awarded. Provided<br/>that participation and/or attendance is at the expense of the employee, one (1) unit of credit will<br/>be granted for every fifteen (15) hours of participation in the training. Teachers utilizing this<br/>process must sign an agreement with the administration (prior to the training) stating the expected<br/>outcome of the experience and must furnish agreed upon evidence of meeting this outcome before<br/>credit can be awarded.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All credit given for experiences other than approved college courses will be accounted for on an<br/>approved form developed for that purpose and made a part of the teacher's personnel file.
