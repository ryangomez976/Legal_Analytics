<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is any alleged violation, misinterpretation, or</p>
<p>misapplication of any specific provision^) of this Agreement in<br/>writing and which clearly identifies itself as a grievance.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is a unit member or group of unit members or HESTA who</p>
<p>allege that they have been adversely affected by a violation,<br/>misinterpretation, or misapplication of a specific provision of this<br/>Agreement and who file a claim.</p>
<p>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” for purposes of this article is any contractual work day.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate supervisor” is the lowest level administrator having</p>
<p>immediate jurisdiction over the grievant(s) and who has the<br/>authority to adjust grievances.</p>
<p>5.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “representative” shall be a person chosen by HESTA to represent the</p>
<p>grievant.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>5.2.1 Informal Level(Mandatorv)-Immediate Supervisor</p>
<p>Within 30 contractual days after the event that was the basis for the<br/>grievance, or within 30 contractual days of the time when the grievant</p>
<p>reasonably should have known of the event that gave rise to the<br/>grievance, the grievant shall notify in writing, including email, his or<br/>her immediate supervisor (or responsible administrator), and HESTA<br/>grievance chair, of the potential grievance and shall request a face-to-<br/>face meeting. The supervisor shall meet with the grievant within ten<br/>(10) contractual days of the receipt of the written notification or email.<br/>At the grievant’s option, the grievant may be accompanied by a HESTA<br/>representative during this meeting. The objective of this meeting shall<br/>be to resolve the matter informally.</p>
<p>After the informal face-to-face meeting, the immediate supervisor (or<br/>responsible administrator) shall provide a written response to the<br/>grievant within seven (7) contractual days of the informal meeting. If<br/>the immediate supervisor (or responsible administrator) does not<br/>respond within the timelines, the grievance shall proceed automatically<br/>to the next step. The timelines may be extended by mutual agreement<br/>in written form.</p>
<p>5.2.2 Level One Immediate Supervisor/Human Resources Administrator</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the written response or no written<br/>response was received within the informal level timeline, the grievant,<br/>within ten (10) contractual days, shall submit a written statement of the<br/>grievance on the appropriate form (see Appendix E-2) to his/her<br/>immediate supervisor (or responsible administrator), the Human<br/>Resources Administrator and the HESTA grievance chair. The<br/>statement shall include a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the<br/>specific provision(s) of the contract allegedly violated, the circumstances<br/>involved, the informal response provided, the specific remedy sought,<br/>and the date of the alleged act or omission. The grievant, immediate<br/>supervisor (or responsible administrator), and Human Resources<br/>Administrator shall meet within seven (7) contractual days of<br/>submission of the grievant’s written statement. The grievant may be<br/>accompanied by a representative of HESTA. If the grievant prefers to<br/>represent himself or herself, a copy of the grievance will be sent to<br/>HESTA.</p>
<p>Within seven (7) contractual days after the meeting to review the<br/>grievance, the immediate supervisor (or responsible administrator)<br/>shall state his/her decision in writing on the appropriate form (see<br/>Appendix E-3) and shall forward a copy of the decision to the Human<br/>Resources Administrator HESTA and the grievant. If the immediate<br/>supervisor does not respond within the timelines, the grievance shall<br/>proceed automatically to the next step. The District or grievant may<br/>waive the right to meet in person and the District may proceed with</p>
<p>rendering a written decision no later than fourteen (14) contractual days<br/>from when the Level One grievance is received. The timelines may be<br/>extended by mutual agreement in written form.</p>
<p>5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two - Sunerintendent/Designee</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the written disposition of the<br/>grievance at Level One or if no written decision has been rendered<br/>within the level one timeline described in 5.2.2, the grievant may file a<br/>written appeal of the grievance on the appropriate form (see Appendix<br/>E-4) with the Superintendent, with a copy to HESTA grievance chair,<br/>within seven (7) contractual days after the written decision at Level<br/>One.</p>
<p>Within seven (7) contractual days after delivery of the appeal, the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee will confer with the grievant in an<br/>effort to resolve the problem. An Association representative may be<br/>present at this conference. Within seven (7) contractual days after the<br/>grievance conference, the Superintendent/designee shall submit his/her<br/>decision in writing on the appropriate form (see Appendix E-5) to<br/>HESTA grievance chair, with a copy to the grievant and a copy to the<br/>immediate supervisor involved in Level One.</p>
<p>The District or grievant may waive the right to meet in person and the<br/>District may proceed with rendering a written decision no later than<br/>fourteen (14) contractual days from when the Level Two grievance is<br/>received. If the Superintendent, or designee, does not respond within the<br/>timelines, the grievance shall proceed automatically to the next step.<br/>The timelines may be extended by mutual agreement in written form.</p>
<p>5.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three - Arbitration</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at<br/>Level Two, or if no written decision has been rendered within the Level<br/>2 timeline described above in 5.2.3, the grievant may request in writing<br/>that HESTA submit the grievance to arbitration. HESTA, by written<br/>notice to the Superintendent within fourteen (14) contractual days after<br/>receipt of the Superintendent’s response (Appendix E-5) may submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration using the appropriate form (See Appendix E-6).<br/>At all times during a Level Three grievance, the grievant shall be<br/>represented by a HESTA member or its designated representative.</p>

<p>After the arbitrator has been selected, a hearing shall be<br/>conducted by the arbitrator. Hearings shall be confined to<br/>contractual days, unless mutually agreed otherwise.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall conduct the hearing in accordance<br/>with the voluntary arbitration rules of the American<br/>Arbitration Association and the provisions of this<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>Upon mutual agreement of the District and HESTA, the<br/>arbitration may proceed under expedited rules of the<br/>American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>The arbitrator will rule first on any issue of arbitrability.<br/>Upon a request of either party, the arbitrator will provide<br/>a written decision on the issue of arbitrability before<br/>rendering any decision on the substance of the dispute.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract<br/>from, or modify the terms of this Agreement, and the<br/>arbitrator shall interpret this Agreement in accordance<br/>with accepted arbitral standards of contract interpretation.<br/>In addition, the arbitrator will be without power or<br/>authority to make any decision prohibited by law or that<br/>violates the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>hearing. Parties in interest and their representatives shall<br/>have the right to be present at such hearings.</p>
<p>5.2.4.10 The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set<br/>forth the arbitrator’s findings of fact, reasoning, and<br/>conclusions of the issues submitted. A copy of the award<br/>will be submitted to the District, the grievant, and HESTA.<br/>The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding upon the<br/>parties.</p>
<p>5.3 General Provisions</p>
<p>5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible. The<br/>number of days indicated at each level should be considered as a<br/>maximum and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The<br/>timelines specified may be extended by mutual consent of the parties.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will not take reprisals affecting the employment status of<br/>any unit member, party in interest, any HESTA representative, or any<br/>other participant in the procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any records pertaining to a grievance shall be kept in a confidential file<br/>separate from the grievant’s official District personnel file. Such records<br/>shall not be utihzed in evaluations or in any recommendation for job<br/>placement. While in the process or within 30 days of the settlement of<br/>the grievance, a member of the HESTA’s Executive Board and/or<br/>grievant shall have access to the confidential grievance file.</p>
<p>5.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may present grievances to the District and have such<br/>grievances adjusted, without HESTA’s intervention, as long as the<br/>district has informed the HESTA grievance chair on each level of the<br/>grievance procedure. The adjustment shall not be inconsistent with the<br/>terms of this Agreement. The District shall not agree to a resolution of<br/>a grievance until HESTA has received a copy of the proposed resolution<br/>and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>5.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant and/or a HESTA representative will be released from duty<br/>without loss of pay to attend a scheduled grievance meeting with a<br/>District representative. Any unit member who is requested by the<br/>District to appear in such investigation, meeting, or hearing as a witness<br/>will be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>5.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from the action of authority higher than the<br/>principal, the grievance may be filed with the appropriate management<br/>person. The parties agree, however, that it is beneficial to all parties</p>
<p>-9-</p>
<p>concerned that any grievance be initiated at the lowest appropriate<br/>level.</p>
<p>5.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be<br/>processed through all levels of procedure by the last working day of the<br/>school year, the time limits set forth in this Article may be reduced upon<br/>mutual agreement, so that the procedure may be completed before the<br/>end of the school year, or as soon thereafter as practicable.</p>

<p>6.4.2.4 Pav Status And Benefits</p>

<p>The stipend awarded (S<sub>n</sub>) equals $75 plus the product of $25 times the<br/>sum of the number of student groups (n) the teacher has. So, if a teacher<br/>has an extra three (3) groups often (10) students, the sum of the number<br/>of extra student groups is {1+2+3} = 6. Six (6) times $25 equals $150.<br/>This $150 added to the $75 base stipend equals a stipend of $225.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 8: TRANSFERS</p>
<p>8.1 Definitions</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer is the relocation of a unit member from one school site to<br/>another.</p>
<p>8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary transfers are initiated by the unit member.</p>
<p>8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers are initiated by District and not agreed to by<br/>unit member.</p>
<p>8.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assignment, is the placement of a unit member at a specific site<br/>and position. For the purposes of this Article, a “position” refers to<br/>the assigned grade-level, subject, or specialized duties. A change in<br/>assignment is any change in a position at the same job site. The<br/>assignment is at District’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>8.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy is any position remaining unfilled after the process of<br/>assignment defined in Section 8.2.1, or a position declared vacant for<br/>filling during the school year.</p>
<p>8.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date of hire means the date the unit member first rendered paid<br/>service to the District in probationary status as defined by Education<br/>Code Sections 44845 and 44846, or their successor provisions.</p>
<p>-37-</p>
<p>8.1.7 Reassignment Pursuant to Education Code Section 44955 is a change<br/>to a different program and/or a movement from one work site to<br/>another and/or a change in position at the same job site as a result of<br/>layoff pursuant to Education Code Section 44955.</p>
<p>8.2 Voluntary Transfer - Posting And Filling Of Vacancies</p>
<p>8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will respond in writing with their intent to return for<br/>the following year and their assignment preferences to the Human<br/>Resources Department by March 15 of each school year. On or before<br/>March 15, the Human Resources Department will notify all<br/>probationary and permanent unit members of their employment<br/>status with the District for the following year.</p>
<p>All newly created positions for the new TK-8 and magnet schools will<br/>not be subject to the assignment procedure in this Section 8.2.1, but<br/>will be posted as vacancies. Once a position at these new schools has<br/>been initially filled through the posting of vacancies, the regular<br/>school assignment process will apply to that position.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All site positions not assigned will be considered vacant and will be<br/>subject to the posting and filling provisions below. The Human<br/>Resources Department will make every attempt to assign unit<br/>members requesting transfers on the intent-to-return form to their<br/>submitted grade and school site preferences. If unable to grant a unit<br/>member’s first choice for placement, the Human Resources<br/>Department will include in the written notification of temporary<br/>placement the reason(s) why the first choice was unavailable.</p>
<p>All vacancies will be posted electronically, and sent to all unit<br/>members via District email and will include school site, approximate<br/>grade level, and any specific requirements or desired skills. The<br/>postings will also be located on the District website, and in a<br/>prominent location at each school site and in the District Office for a<br/>minimum of five (5) working days prior to filling the vacancy. The<br/>filing date will be listed unless the position is posted as “Open Until<br/>Filled.” In addition to the posting, unit members will be notified of<br/>position(s) by e-mail. Interested members will submit their names,<br/>in writing on an in-house application, for open or new positions. Unit<br/>members wishing to receive vacancy notices mailed to them outside<br/>the regular contractual workdays may request this notification in<br/>writing by providing the Human Resources Office with a mailing<br/>address. In addition, vacancies must be posted on District’s Web site<br/>and at each summer school site during the summer school period.</p>
<p>Positions becoming available due to the long term absences of a unit<br/>member during the school year need not be posted. Positions<br/>becoming available within the last five (5) days before the first day<br/>of school may be filled as the District sees fit.</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria For Selection Of Voluntary Transfer Applicants</p>
<p>8.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All voluntary transfer applicants will be interviewed by<br/>Principals and may be interviewed by the Superintendent<br/>or designee. Principal interviews may be conducted by<br/>telephone. Selection of a voluntarily transferring unit<br/>member for an open position will be based upon<br/>credential(s), date of hire in District, and the unit<br/>member’s qualifications by verifiable academic training<br/>and/or verifiable experience for the specific requirements<br/>in the position’s posting.</p>
<p>8.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After April 15, however, there will be no priority provided<br/>to an applicant over other qualified applicants on the basis<br/>of the above criteria. (Refer to Education Code Section<br/>35036.)</p>
<p>8.2.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members will have equal opportunity to apply for<br/>and be considered for openings at other school sites as they<br/>occur, taking into account the transfer’s disruption to the<br/>instructional program during the school year. A current<br/>unit member applicant will be considered on an equal basis<br/>with any applicant for any vacancy that occurs after April<br/>15 for the following school year.</p>
<p>8.2.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the District will not select an applicant who<br/>applies to a school that is ranked in deciles 1 to 3, inclusive,<br/>on the Academic Performance Index, if the Principal of the<br/>school refuses to accept the applicant. (Refer to Education<br/>Code Section 35036.)</p>
<p>8.2.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval of voluntary transfer applications is solely within<br/>the District’s discretion.</p>
<p>8.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 25, the Human Resources Office wifi notify each unit<br/>member of his/her tentative school designation for the following year.</p>
<p>8.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change from the Section 8.2.4 tentative school designation wifi<br/>be made only on the basis of unpredictable changes in student<br/>enrollment or unexpected staff vacancies. All unit members involved<br/>will be contacted as soon as the change is known to be necessary.</p>
<p>8.3 Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will attempt to meet its needs and all grade placements<br/>through voluntary transfer. A unit member who did not request a<br/>transfer to fill a vacant position may be selected by the District to fill<br/>a vacant position. An involuntary transfer may be initiated on the<br/>basis of school closure or consolidation, reduction in school site staff,<br/>or when the Superintendent or designee concludes that the transfer<br/>is in the best interest of the District (Ed Code 35035(c). Except for<br/>transfer in the best interest of the District, involuntary transfers will<br/>not be punitive in nature.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that an involuntary transfer appears necessary, the<br/>Human Resources Department will confer with all unit members<br/>being considered for an unfilled assignment to attempt to provide a<br/>solution to the need.</p>
<p>Unit members being involuntarily transferred will be given priority<br/>consideration over other unit members seeking voluntary transfers<br/>for a vacant position if the unit member has notified the District of<br/>his/her interest in writing. Except for transfer in the best interest of<br/>the District (Ed Code 35035(c), the decision as to which unit member<br/>will be involuntarily transferred will be based on the following<br/>criteria:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the best interests of the District;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the unit member’s credential to perform the required services;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the unit member’s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualifications by training and/or</p>
<p>experience;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legal mandates.</p>
<p>If two or more unit members &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are equally qualified after considering</p>
<p>the above criteria, the unit members with the most recent date of<br/>hire will be transferred.</p>
<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an involuntary transfer, the Superintendent will<br/>inform the affected unit member in writing of the reason(s) for the<br/>involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>8.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for transfers in the best interest of the District (Ed Code<br/>35035(c), an involuntarily-transferred unit member will be given<br/>priority of returning to his/her previous assignment the following<br/>year if the unit member has notified the District in writing of his/her</p>
<p>-40-</p>
<p>interest. The involuntarily-transferred unit member will be given<br/>priority over new hires and voluntary transfers.</p>
<p>8.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority/first priority will mean that unless the District states in<br/>writing additional requirements for that position prior to the position<br/>being advertised, the involuntarily transferred unit member will be<br/>given the assignment.</p>
<p>8.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member will be involuntarily transferred twice within two</p>
<p>(2) successive years. This provision does not apply to transfers due to<br/>relocation of Special Education services. However, in addition to the<br/>District relocation stipend as stated in 8.4.1., these Special<br/>Education unit members will receive an additional stipend of $1,000<br/>their second year of involuntary transfer. Should a Special Education<br/>Unit Member be involuntarily transferred three (3) or more years<br/>successively, the unit member will also receive the relocation stipend<br/>and the additional stipend of $1,000 for each successive year of<br/>involuntary transfer to different school sites. Any Special Education<br/>Unit Member that remains at the same site for two (2) years or more<br/>is no longer eligible for this stipend, unless in the future, they are<br/>involuntarily transferred twice within two (2) successive years.<br/>Special Education unit members included in this section are SDC,<br/>Mild/Moderate, Moderate/Severe, RSP, and LSH Specialists.</p>
<p>8.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntarily transferred unit members may be interviewed by the<br/>receiving principal. Any unit member being involuntarily<br/>transferred may prepare a written statement expressing their<br/>concerns about the transfer, and this written statement will be<br/>included in the unit member’s personnel file.</p>
<p>8.4 Classroom Moves</p>
<p>8.4.1 Any unit member being involuntarily transferred, voluntarily<br/>transferred, or reassigned to a different school site or whose change in<br/>assignment as defined in Article 8.1.4 or Article 8.1.7 results in a<br/>classroom move at the same site as defined in Article 8.1.7 will receive<br/>a per diem rate for up to three (3) days prior to any student contact in<br/>order to set up a new classroom. Prior to the three (3) days, the District<br/>will remove any materials from the classroom to which the unit member<br/>is transferred, other than standard grade-level/subject matter<br/>instructional materials required by the site administrator. The unit<br/>member and principal shall mutually agree on the dates to be worked.</p>

<p>-42-</p>
<p>leave campus during the duty free lunch period and they must<br/>indicate where they can be reached in case of emergency.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above contractual hours of employment, unit members may<br/>be required to attend meetings extending past normal duty hours for purposes<br/>directed by the site administrator. Mandatory attendance at these meetings<br/>shall begin at the end of the contractual day and last no longer than (1) hour<br/>beyond the end of the contractual day. Staff shall not be required to attend<br/>more than three (3) of these meetings in any school month. All unit members<br/>at that site are required to be present.</p>

An individual activity shall not<br/>exceed sixty (60) minutes unless a unit member voluntarily agrees to an<br/>extension. A site administrator may call for an emergency meeting in the event<br/>of circumstances where the administrator deems such a meeting to be<br/>necessary.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation And Planning Time</p>
<p>9.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members teaching middle school grades 7, and 8, and 6 if the<br/>District includes 6th grade students in the middle schools, will have<br/>one period per day to prepare for their assigned subjects, together<br/>with a maximum of five instructional periods requiring academic<br/>preparation. The minutes listed in 9.1.2 include this preparation<br/>time. Any change in the type of instructional scheduling that will<br/>impact teaching hours or workload will be subject to the opportunity<br/>to negotiate.</p>
<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the District’s TK-6th self-contained class size equals or<br/>exceeds 30:1, any transitional kindergarten through sixth grade<br/>regular classroom teacher may request up to - four days of<br/>preparation time for planning and instructional development and 2<br/>additional days will be used for grade level collaboration. This<br/>preparation time may be used in full day increments and is subject<br/>to prior approval by the site administrator and subject to the<br/>availability of a substitute. Unit members are to report to their site<br/>at the start of any requested preparation and all preparation time<br/>must be done on the school site unless approved by the school site<br/>administrator. This preparation time shall be used as the instructor<br/>determines, with any denied days carried over to the next trimester,<br/>but not to the next school year. The last day of school is not available</p>
<p>-43-</p>
<p>for preparation time. Teachers who are eligible to receive this<br/>preparation time, and who have requested more than one time for<br/>each day but are not able to schedule due to substitute shortage, shall<br/>receive the individual teacher’s daily rate of pay at the end of the<br/>school year in lieu of the preparation time. In addition, a teacher<br/>who has scheduled this preparation time but was not able to take it<br/>due to substitute reassignment, shall receive one (1) hour of the<br/>Other Hourly rate pay as indicated in Appendix C per day of<br/>substitute plans. Because the teacher provided regular instruction,<br/>the day shall not be construed to have been one of the allocated<br/>preparation days.</p>
<p>9.4.3 Thursday early-release time at elementary school sites shall be used<br/>for collaborative grade/team planning aligned with the school’s<br/>Single Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and for individual<br/>preparation. Eighteen (18) early release days will be used for<br/>collaborative purposes and seventeen (17) early release days will be<br/>used for individual preparation time to be alternated throughout the<br/>school year. The Thursdays will consist of 60 consecutive minutes of<br/>collaborative planning and 30 minutes will be for individual<br/>preparation.</p>
<p>This time cannot be used for staff meetings, or for District directed<br/>activities. Nonetheless, the site administrator will be engaged with<br/>the teachers in the collaboration process and in providing support for<br/>planning.</p>

<p>-44-</p>
<p>assessments, or other related activities connected to<br/>implementing the Common Core State Standards.</p>
<p>3. Student Planning - Unit members at the above mentioned sites<br/>and grades will use this time for individual planning aligned with<br/>site’s SPSA and to make contact with student’s parents/guardians<br/>regarding behavior, academic progress, etc. Due to the nature of<br/>the SST, 504, and IEP needs of our student population, both the<br/>school sites and district shall make every effort to schedule these<br/>meetings on early Thursdays at the sites listed in this section.</p>
<p>Thursday early release time activities designated on each<br/>Thursday shall begin 30 minutes after student dismissal and<br/>shall end with the contractual work day.</p>
<p>9.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is required to write lesson plans for District-required<br/>business but who is not able to attend scheduled District business because of<br/>substitute reassignment will receive, for making the lesson plans, a one (1)<br/>hour stipend at the District hourly rate list in Appendix C.</p>

Such teachers shall not be eligible for the forty-five<br/>(45) hours of compensation pursuant to section 11.5.1, but shall be eligible to<br/>be compensated for up to five (5) hours annually at the Other Hourly Rate<br/>listed in Appendix C for time spent attending IEP meetings after work hours<br/>(Article 11.5.1)</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workload</p>
<p>Unit members’ workloads may be affected by changes in the instructional<br/>program. The District will provide release time for additional student<br/>assessments that increase the teachers’ workload. In addition, the District will<br/>provide notice and opportunity to negotiate the increase in workload due to<br/>changes initiated by the District in the instructional program.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Parent Conferences</p>
<p>When the time provided by five (5) minimum days is insufficient to schedule<br/>parent conferences with teachers, and there are no open slots within the time<br/>provided, and the unit member maintained a log of failed phone call attempts<br/>to reach parents and subsequent conferences, the District will provide up to</p>
<p>-45-</p>
<p>four (4) additional hours of pay at the unit member’s per diem rate of pay for<br/>parent conferences scheduled outside the regular work day. Unit members<br/>shall submit a parent conference schedule to document their conference hours.</p>
<p>9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administrators will provide unit members with any available information<br/>pertinent to their students/subject matter within the first ten (10) days of<br/>school, including but not limited to the most recent available CST scores,<br/>CELDT, SPED status, including 504 and any modifications required, and<br/>health status.</p>
<p>9.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administrators shall make every effort to hold SST, 504 Plan and<br/>IEP meetings during the school day, and to provide coverage for<br/>classroom teachers whose attendance is mandatory at those meetings.</p>
<p>9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member being required to travel to more than one site to complete<br/>their job duties will be reimbursed for mileage at the federal rate established<br/>during the time posted in their log. Mileage reimbursement forms (Appendix<br/>G) will be submitted to the Business Department at the end of each month.</p>
<p>9.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will not be responsible for the collection of the at-risk/retention<br/>letters that are mailed to parents unless the unit member chooses to be a part<br/>of the collection process. Unit members will meet with the parents who wish to<br/>discuss the letters.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10: EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>10.1 Frequency</p>
<p>10.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District management shall evaluate temporary and probationary<br/>bargaining unit members at least once during each school year, and<br/>permanent unit members at least once every two years.</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member with permanent status may be evaluated every five<br/>(5) years if that individual:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been employed in the District for at least ten (10) years,</p>

<p>10.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member returning from a leave of absence for more than one<br/>semester shall begin with an evaluation on the first year of returning<br/>to duty.</p>
<p>10.2 Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The evaluation shall be based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>10.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of students toward the applicable state-adopted<br/>academic content standards as measured by state-adopted criterion<br/>referenced assessments and other multiple measures.</p>
<p>10.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of non-instructional duties and responsibilities<br/>normally associated with the unit member’s assignment. (See<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession (“CSTP”)<br/>Standard “7.”)</p>
<p>10.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adherence to curricular objectives. (See CSTP Standards “3”<br/>and “4.”)</p>

<p>10.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructional techniques and strategies. (See CSTP Standards “1,”<br/>“3,” and “4.”)</p>
<p>10.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above criteria shall be supplemented by the CSTP, which<br/>together with the first criterion shall constitute the standards for the<br/>evaluation of the unit member. The references to CSTP are listed<br/>above parenthetically.</p>
<p>-47-</p>
<p>10.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations shall not include the use of publishers’ norms<br/>established by standardized tests.</p>
<p>10.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For non-instructional unit members, the evaluation shall be based<br/>on the performance of job duties and responsibilities contained in the<br/>job description.</p>

<p>r nnmwnrv Indicate accomplishment: and future goal:. Provide attachment: ifneeded</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student progress towards English Language Arts ALS benchmarks incficates an increase from the<br/>first to second administration.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement noted regarding seeking and providing appropriate materials for a lesson.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement noted in providing alternate grouping of students to facilitate team work. Classroom<br/>arrangement now facilitates alternative student responses.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noted that students now employ alternatives to raising hands or calling out. i_e. pair-share.</p>
<p>C omments Supervisor's comment: should refer to specific exemplar: where progress is unsatisfactory. Jf performance<br/>is unsatisfactory, comment: below should provide evidence to support this rating, and specific recommendation: must<br/>be provided to assist with improvement Attachments may be provided if needed (Per negotiated contract 10.3 .4)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student groups are still not leveled by instructional needs. The activity viewed did not challenge<br/>students to use critical thinking skills; questions consisted of recall and using pictures for cues. This<br/>was a practice activity rather than instruction in a new concept</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom environment does not provide students with resources for new information or for<br/>clarification. For example, although you have been continuously requested to provide one. there is<br/>no evidence of an improved focus wall which is an integral part of the Houghton-Mifflln instructional<br/>program.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited classroom procedures are in place and adhered to continuously Students continued to<br/>disturb others during my observation of their reading time by sharpening pencils and talking loudly<br/>about topics other than the standards being taughtAeamed.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the activity was conducted through small groups I did not observe any new learning or new<br/>concepts being taught. I saw students being guided through an independent practice activity, one<br/>that the students should have and could have been doing on their own.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not see new concepts being introduced; nor did I view a focus wall, differentiated instruction, or<br/>effective classroom management (see above). There is no evidence of collaboration with peers or<br/>other suggested resources (i.e. coaches, mentors or District Office personnel). Ample opportunities<br/>to do so have been provided to you during the past 10 weeks</p>

Describe your plan to ensure consistent classroom management, including (1)<br/>behavior and discipline standards; (2) methods by which classroom assignments will<br/>be given, collected and evaluated; (3) methods by which student progress will be<br/>monitored and recorded; and (4) methods by which unit members will communicate<br/>information about students with each other, parents and administrators. §6.2.9.1.5<br/>(Attach additional pages as needed).</p>
<p>We acknowledge both unit members shall attend all pre-instruction work days, Back-To-School and Open House Nights, and annual District<br/>curriculum in-services unless extenuating circumstances, as determined by the District, prevent a job-share partner from fulfilling this<br/>responsibility. §6.2.9.3.1 The job share partner on duty shall attend scheduled faculty and department meetings unless otherwise directed<br/>by the site administrator. Both partners will attend special staff meetings or conferences with the immediate supervisor as determined by<br/>the immediate supervisor. §6.2.9.3.2 Written student progress reports to parents will be the joint responsibility of both partners. Partners<br/>shall jointly conduct parent conferences. §6.2.9.3.4 We also acknowledge that we have read and understand all subsections of Section<br/>6.3.9 - Job Share Leaves.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that in order to retain our Health and Welfare benefits, either of our FTE percentage must be 50% or greater. We also<br/>acknowledge that as part-time employees either of us can opt out of retaining benefits and, should either of us choose to continue with<br/>these benefits, that employee will be required to pay the proportional percentage of benefit premiums equivalent to the percentage of his/her<br/>job share leave.</p>
