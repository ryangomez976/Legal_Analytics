<p>Each of the formal requirements and time limitations<br/>stated herein for the processing and determination of<br/>grievances shall be strictly adhered to, provided however,<br/>that any such time limit may be extended by the express<br/>written agreement of both parties. If the grievant fails to<br/>appeal the grievance within the time limit specified in any<br/>step of the grievance procedure, the grievance shall be<br/>deemed waived and terminated. If the District fails to<br/>comply with any of the time limits specified, the grievance<br/>shall move automatically to the next higher step if a higher<br/>step exists. Since it is important that grievances be<br/>processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits specified<br/>at each level should be considered the maximum and every<br/>effort should be made to expedite the process. The time<br/>limits may, however, be extended in writing by mutual<br/>agreement. In the event a grievance is filed at such a time<br/>that it cannot be processed through all the steps by the<br/>end of the school year (last teacher duty day exclusive of<br/>summer school), and if left unresolved harms a grievant,<br/>the time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the<br/>procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school<br/>year or as soon as is practical.</p>

<p>ARTICLE IX: SICK LEAVES AND LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>&quot;Sick Leave&quot; shall mean accrued increments of compensated leave<br/>provided by the District to a unit member as a benefit of the<br/>employment for use by the unit member during any absence from the<br/>employment for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee is unable to perform his or her duties due to<br/>illness, injury, or a medical condition of the employee.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence is for the purpose of obtaining professional diagnosis<br/>or treatment for a medical condition of the employee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence is due to a pregnancy-related illness of the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence is for the purpose of obtaining a physical for the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon return from any absence, an employee shall file an absence<br/>report on a district absence report form verifying the reason for<br/>the absence. The district form must be submitted to the<br/>Principal’s office no later than the fifth consecutive workday<br/>after returning to work. If the employee does not submit the<br/>form within this time, the employee will be reminded of this<br/>requirement via email or by other verifiable delivery notice. If<br/>the form is not submitted within five workdays from the date the<br/>unit member receives said reminder, the employee will be docked<br/>in the next pay period for the day(s) in question.</p>
<p>9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full-time certificated employee shall be entitled to</p>
<p>one (1) day of leave of absence for illness or injury for<br/>each month included in his/her regular yearly contract. An<br/>employee for less than full time is entitled to that<br/>proportion of the leave of absence as the number of days<br/>he/she is employed per week bears to five (5) and/or the<br/>number of periods employed bears to six (6). Under no<br/>circumstances can an employee earn more than one (1)<br/>day's sick-leave entitlement in a single day, more than one</p>
<p>(1) month's in a calendar month, etc.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full amount of a person's sick-leave entitlement shall</p>
<p>be credited to his/her sick-leave account at the beginning<br/>of the school year or upon the teacher's first day of<br/>employment. Credit for sick leave need not be accrued<br/>prior to taking such leave.</p>
<p>9.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not deducted from wages, sick leave</p>
<p>earned from that employment cannot be used for<br/>retirement credit.</p>
<p>9.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for summer school and adult school night</p>
<p>classes is not transferable to the regular school year<br/>records but will be cumulatively maintained for each<br/>employee teaching in summer school or adult night school<br/>under the following conditions:</p>
<p>9.1.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No payment shall be made for unused sick<br/>leave under this provision nor shall it be<br/>applied to any form of retirement credit.</p>
<p>9.1.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day of sick leave shall be credited for a<br/>full regular high school summer school<br/>session.</p>
<p>9.1.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of time constituting one teaching<br/>session shall be credited for each full<br/>semester of adult night school teaching.</p>
<p>9.1.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave accumulated under this provision is not<br/>transferable to another school district.</p>
<p>9.1.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer school sick leave shall be credited to<br/>the teacher at the beginning of the session.</p>
<p>9.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>No compensation will be paid for unused sick leave at<br/>termination of employment.</p>
<p>9.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been employed in a</p>
<p>school district for one full year or more and who accepts a<br/>position in another school district or county schools office</p>
<p>may have transferred with him/her all accumulated unused<br/>sick leave.</p>
<p>9.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retirement,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credited</p>
<p>as additional time taught and as such will be added to the<br/>amount of credited time upon which the retirement<br/>benefit is based.</p>
<p>9.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a</p>
<p>position requiring certification qualifications has exhausted<br/>all available sick leave, including all accumulated sick<br/>leave, and continues to be absent from his or her duties on<br/>account of illness or accident for an additional period of<br/>100 school days whether or not the absence arises out of or<br/>in the course of the employment of the employee, the<br/>amount deducted from the salary due him or her for any of<br/>the additional 100 school days in which the absence occurs<br/>shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a substitute<br/>employee employed to fill his or her position during his or<br/>her absence or, if no substitute employee was employed<br/>the amount that would have been paid to the substitute<br/>had he or she been employed. The school district shall<br/>make every reasonable effort to secure the services of a<br/>substitute employee. (Ed. Code 44977 a)</p>
<p>The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the<br/>100 days shall run consecutively. (Ed. Code 44977 b-1)</p>
<p>An employee shall not be provided more than one, 100-day<br/>allotment per illness or accident. However, if the school<br/>year ends before the 100-day period is exhausted, the</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>employee may take the balance of the 100 days in a<br/>subsequent school year. (Ed. Code 44977 b-2)</p>
<p>9.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who is absent because of illness or accident<br/>from the duties to which he/she has been assigned by the<br/>District shall receive his/her regular full pay for each full<br/>day and/or period of such absence insofar as such teacher<br/>has credited and/or accumulated sick leave in his/her<br/>account to cover said absence.</p>
<p>9.1.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a physician's verification of illness.</p>
<p>If this verification requires additional medical expenses<br/>not covered by the District health plan, they will be paid<br/>by the District.</p>
<p>9.1.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female employees may use accumulated sick leave for<br/>disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy.</p>
<p>9.1.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>9.1.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is, or whose family<br/>member (spouse or child) is, suffering from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury may request<br/>donations of accrued sick leave credits in<br/>accordance with the following guidelines:</p>
<p>9.1.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic injury or illness means an illness<br/>or injury that is expected to incapacitate the<br/>employee for an extended period of time, or<br/>that incapacitates a member of the<br/>employee's immediate family (spouse or<br/>children) which incapacity requires the<br/>employee to take time off from work for an</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>9.1.12.3</p>
<p>9.1.12.4</p>
<p>9.1.12.5</p>
<p>extended period of time to care for that<br/>family member, and taking extended time off<br/>work creates a financial hardship for the<br/>employee because he/she has exhausted all<br/>of his/her sick leave and other paid time off.<br/>Upon requesting donations under this<br/>program, the unit member shall provide<br/>verification of the catastrophic injury or<br/>illness. (Education Code 44043.5)</p>
<p>Verification shall be made by means of a<br/>letter, dated and signed by the sick or injured<br/>person's physician, indicating the<br/>incapacitating nature and probable duration<br/>of the illness or injury.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall<br/>determine:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the unit member is unable to work<br/>due to the unit member's (or her/his<br/>family member's) catastrophic illness or<br/>injury, and</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the unit member has exhausted<br/>all accrued paid leave credits. Not to<br/>include leave as defined in section<br/>9.1.8.</p>
<p>When the above verification and<br/>determinations are made, the Superintendent<br/>or designee may approve the transfer of</p>

<p>accrued sick leave credits (Education Code</p>
<p>44043.5) .</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall inform<br/>unit members of the means by which<br/>donations may be made in response to the<br/>unit member's request.</p>
<p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member, upon written notice to the<br/>District, may donate accrued sick leave<br/>credits to the requesting unit member in<br/>whole day increments only. All transfers of<br/>eligible leave credit shall be irrevocable, and<br/>there shall be no adjustment for individual<br/>salary differences (Education Code 44043.5).</p>
<p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that unit members retain sufficient<br/>accrued sick leave to meet needs that<br/>normally arise, donors shall not reduce their<br/>accumulated sick leave to fewer than thirty<br/>(30) days.</p>
<p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefiting unit members may use donated<br/>leave credits for a maximum of 120 contract<br/>days.</p>
<p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who receives paid leave<br/>pursuant to this program shall use any leave<br/>credits that she/he continues to accrue on a<br/>monthly basis before receiving paid leave<br/>pursuant to this program (Education Code</p>
<p>44043.5) .</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>9.1.12.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donors shall indicate the number of days they<br/>wish to donate for each recipient. A<br/>maximum of one day can be used from<br/>multiple-day donors, until all donors have<br/>donated one day, by lottery, for each leave<br/>request. Multiple-day donors then participate<br/>in additional lotteries to determine who shall<br/>donate additional days. Unallotted days are<br/>returned to the donor.</p>
<p>9.1.12.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to STRS regulations, certificated may<br/>contribute only to other certificated<br/>employees.</p>
<p>9.1.12.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall ensure<br/>that all donations are confidential.</p>

<p>9.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Applications</p>
<p>9.5.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests for sabbatical leave shall be<br/>reviewed by a sabbatical leave committee.</p>

<p>9.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report: Each employee who has been on</p>
<p>sabbatical leave shall file with the sabbatical leave<br/>committee a written report not later than sixty (60) days<br/>after return to active duty. Such report shall contain<br/>detailed data as to the activities of the employee, together<br/>with the employee's appraisal of the professional value of<br/>the experience gained while on leave, the manner in which<br/>such experience or knowledge gained may be used for the<br/>benefit of the students or the school in which the<br/>employee is located, and any other data necessary for a<br/>satisfactory report. The employee shall not be considered<br/>as having completed the requirements of sabbatical leave<br/>until his/her report has been recommended by the<br/>sabbatical leave committee and approved by the<br/>Superintendent and the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>9.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sabbatical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave</p>

<p>35</p>
<p>salary, excluding any extra duty bonuses, and the salary of<br/>the substitute hired to replace him/her. An employee who<br/>receives compensation from other sources while on<br/>sabbatical leave shall reimburse the District for any money<br/>that he/she receives above one hundred (100) percent of<br/>his/her regular salary, excluding extra duty bonuses.</p>
<p>Fringe benefits will be maintained by the District at the<br/>same level as for other employees.</p>
<p>9.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Payment for Leave of Absence Time: Payment</p>
<p>may be made in one of these ways:</p>
<p>9.5.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for a one- (1-) semester leave<br/>may be paid during the first year after the<br/>employee returns to duty upon certification<br/>by the sabbatical leave committee that the<br/>program of study, research, or travel has<br/>been satisfactorily completed.</p>
<p>9.5.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation for a one- (1-) year leave may<br/>be paid during the first two (2) years after the<br/>employee returns upon recommendation of<br/>the sabbatical leave committee.</p>
<p>9.5.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation may be paid the employee<br/>while on the leave of absence in the same<br/>manner as if the employee were teaching in<br/>the District upon the furnishing by the<br/>employee of a suitable bond indemnifying the<br/>District against loss in the event the employee<br/>fails to render the agreed upon period of</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>9.5.10</p>
<p>service following the leave of absence or if<br/>the Board of Trustees waives the bond and<br/>accepts by resolution a written agreement<br/>from the employee to return for the required<br/>period of time.</p>
<p>Return to Service</p>
<p>9.5.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee granted sabbatical leave with<br/>pay shall agree to return to the service of the<br/>school district for a period of time which is<br/>equal to twice the period of the leave. In the<br/>event the employee fails to return to render<br/>the required service or fails to carry out<br/>satisfactorily the program of study, research,<br/>or travel, the employee shall reimburse the<br/>District for compensation received including<br/>fringe benefit allowances. If part of the time<br/>has been served, the repayment shall be<br/>proportionate to the percentage of time not<br/>served.</p>
<p>9.5.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the expiration of the sabbatical leave, the<br/>employee shall be reinstated to a position as<br/>near to that held at the time of the granting<br/>of the leave of absence to the extent feasible<br/>with due regard to the interests of the<br/>District and pupils.</p>

If the applicant indicates on<br/>his/her form that he/she wishes only to be considered for a<br/>particular opening, his/her application form will be<br/>destroyed once that opening is filled; otherwise, the form<br/>will be kept on file for reference by principals when<br/>vacancies occur in their schools.</p>
<p>13.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal of the receiving school, in consultation with<br/>the department head, shall be responsible for reviewing<br/>the requests for transfers, conducting the interviews, and</p>
<p>46</p>

<p>13.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No teacher shall be involuntarily transferred for purposes<br/>of filling an existing vacancy if there is a qualified teacher<br/>with less seniority in the District. The term &quot;qualified<br/>teacher&quot; shall be judged on the following factors:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper credentialing and/or major or minor in the<br/>teaching field(s).</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriateness of teaching experience in the<br/>subjects to be taught.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupil and instructional needs.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the qualifications of those involved are judged to<br/>be equal, District seniority shall be the deciding<br/>factor.</p>
<p>13.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who must be involuntarily transferred shall have<br/>the right to indicate his/her preference and receive</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>consideration for placement from among any vacancies<br/>that exist at the time or that become existent during the<br/>summer vacation period.</p>
<p>13.4.5 An involuntary transfer shall not result in the loss of salary<br/>classification seniority or any fringe benefit to a teacher.</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misassignments</p>
<p>If the District requests a teacher to teach outside of his/her credential<br/>area, the teacher shall be provided (at his/her request) with training<br/>before the academic year begins via the staff development coordinator<br/>or other representative designated by the administration.

<p>26.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conduct of Hearing</p>

<p>27.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action in the form of dismissal shall be in accordance with</p>
<p>the appropriate provisions of the Education Code. Discipline for less<br/>than dismissal shall be for &quot;just cause&quot; imposed in accordance with the<br/>following procedures.</p>
<p>27.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciplined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resulting</p>
<p>from violations of the Education Code, breach of contract, violations of<br/>other laws or regulations, or for violations of board policies and<br/>administrative regulations.</p>
<p>27.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal discipline procedures set forth in 27.3.3 of this Article<br/>generally will be used only if the District has progressed through either<br/>&quot;Step 1 -- Discipline -- Verbal or Written Warnings&quot; or &quot;Step 2 --<br/>Discipline -- Written Reprimands&quot;, except for conduct which is of such a<br/>nature that it injures or threatens to injure the safety of pupils,<br/>employees, or others, or causes substantial disruption to the educational<br/>program, or as otherwise required or provided by law. Immediate<br/>suspension with or without pay may be utilized by the District for those<br/>reasons specified in the Education Code.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>27.3.1</p>
<p>27.3.2</p>
<p>27.3.3</p>
<p>Step 1 -- Discipline -- Verbal or Written Warnings<br/>At the time a Verbal or Written Warning is given, the<br/>principal or immediate supervisor shall discuss and clarify<br/>the specific violation, act, and/or omission with the<br/>employee. The employee shall be given clear direction as<br/>to the District's expectations and requirements for<br/>improvement.</p>
<p>Step 2 -- Discipline -- Written Reprimands<br/>If the conduct warrants a written reprimand or if an<br/>employee repeats the specific violation, act, and/or<br/>omission for which a Verbal or Written Warning has been<br/>given, or fails to take the required pro-active corrective<br/>measures, or commits a separate violation, act, and/or<br/>omission, then the site principal shall administer a Written<br/>Reprimand to the employee which shall be entered into the<br/>employee's personnel file. If a Written Warning had<br/>previously been issued, the Written Warning shall be<br/>attached to the Written Reprimand and also placed in the<br/>employee's personnel file.</p>
<p>27.3.2.1 The District shall attempt to follow &quot;Step 1 --<br/>Discipline -- Verbal or Written Warnings&quot; prior<br/>to issuing &quot;Step 2 -- Discipline -- Written<br/>Reprimands&quot;, but shall not be required to do<br/>so if the employee's conduct justifies a<br/>Written Reprimand without a prior warning.<br/>Step 3 -- Discipline - Suspension Without Pay<br/>If an employee repeats a specific violation, act, and/or</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>omission for which a Verbal or Written Warning or Written<br/>Reprimand has been given, or fails to take the required<br/>pro-active corrective measures, or commits a separate<br/>violation, act and/or omission justifying initial &quot;Step 3 --<br/>Discipline&quot;, then the superintendent or his designee shall<br/>recommend appropriate discipline up to and including a<br/>fifteen (15) day suspension without pay. Suspensions<br/>without pay shall be made subject to the following:</p>
<p>27.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to administering suspension without pay,<br/>the District shall provide notice to the<br/>employee and give the employee an<br/>opportunity to meet with the<br/>superintendent/designee. &quot;Notice of<br/>Suspension&quot; without pay shall include a<br/>statement of the violation(s), incident(s),<br/>and/or misconduct forming the basis for<br/>disciplinary action, and a statement of the<br/>discipline to be imposed. The employee shall<br/>be given five (5) working days within which to<br/>reply, in writing. The proposed suspension<br/>without pay shall not be imposed until after<br/>the employee's written reply has been<br/>received and given consideration by the<br/>superintendent/designee, or until the time<br/>for filing a written reply has expired.</p>
<p>27.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension without pay shall be subject<br/>to a disciplinary hearing, upon request of the</p>
<p>27.4</p>
<p>27.5</p>
<p>employee. An employee shall be entitled to a<br/>hearing on such discipline only if a written<br/>request is filed by the employee with the<br/>superintendent not later than ten (10) school<br/>days of receiving the &quot;Notice of Formal<br/>Discipline&quot;. If the employee files a written<br/>request for a hearing any time within the ten<br/>(10) school day period, a hearing must be held<br/>within the ten (10) school day period from the<br/>day the district received the request from the<br/>employee. If no hearing request is timely<br/>filed, the District shall administer the<br/>suspension without pay during the next pay<br/>period.</p>
<p>27.3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disciplinary hearing on a recommended<br/>suspension without pay shall be held before<br/>the Governing Board. The decision of the<br/>Governing Board shall be in writing and shall<br/>be final.</p>
<p>27.3.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending a disciplinary hearing on a<br/>recommended suspension without pay, except<br/>as otherwise required or permitted by law,<br/>any suspension of an employee shall be with<br/>pay.</p>
<p>Suspensions may be without pay, but shall not reduce or deprive the<br/>unit member of health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>At any step in the discipline process, the employee is entitled to be</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>represented by a representative of the Association, or anyone of his/her<br/>choosing.</p>
<p>27.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements of the discipline process shall be administered as soon as<br/>reasonably possible in relation to the questioned acts or omissions.</p>
<p>27.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this Article shall preclude the District and an employee from</p>
<p>agreeing to a specific type of level of discipline.</p>
<p>27.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this Article shall preclude an employee from responding in</p>
<p>writing to any derogatory written material placed in an employee's<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>27.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discipline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be subject to the grievance</p>
<p>process, but the district shall notify the association in a timely manner<br/>of any disciplinary action taken under sections 27.3.2 and 27.3.3<br/>against any unit member without disclosing the unit member’s name.</p>
<p>27.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be filed on the content of an evaluation or a letter of</p>
<p>reprimand.</p>
