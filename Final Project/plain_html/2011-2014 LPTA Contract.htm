<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding agreement<br/>(&quot;Agreement&quot;) by and between the governing Board of the Loma Prieta School District,<br/>hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Employer&quot; and the Loma Prieta Teachers<br/>Association/California Teachers Association/National Education Association, hereinafter<br/>referred to as the &quot;Association,&quot; an employee organization.</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement does not preclude the possibility of further meeting and negotiating sessions<br/>when both parties mutually agree that such sessions are necessary and/or useful, or in the<br/>event there is a change in state law brought about by administrative or judicial finding or a<br/>change in statute directly affecting the contract.</p>

<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support of Agreement: The Employer and the Association agree that it is to their mutual<br/>benefit to encourage the resolution of differences through the meet and negotiation process.<br/>Therefore, it is agreed that the Association and the Employer will support this Agreement<br/>for its term and will not seek change or improvement in any matter subject to the meet and<br/>negotiation process except by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Association.

<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect of Agreement: It is understood and agreed that the specific provisions contained in<br/>this Agreement shall prevail over District practices and procedures and over State laws to<br/>the extent permitted by State law and that in the absence of specific provisions in this<br/>Agreement such practices and procedures are discretionary.</p>

Before seeking any waiver of this contract:</p>
<p>a. The current contract language that is to be changed must be identified and<br/>submitted to the Association along with a waiver request.</p>

The fourth Monday of each month shall be designated as the second<br/>Association meeting day; however, should the Association not need that Monday for<br/>meetings, the District may request to schedule activities requiring teacher attendance.<br/>Should the District hope to use the fourth Monday for meetings that would require<br/>teacher attendance, the Administrator will contact the LPTA chapter president, not later<br/>than the preceding Thursday. The Association has the right of refusal should a meeting<br/>be scheduled.</p>

<p>12</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a claim by one or more teachers, or the Association, that there has<br/>been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is the person, persons, or Association making the claim.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “party in interest” is any person or persons who might be required to take action or<br/>against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is any day teachers are required to be on duty.</p>
<p>B. Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to the problems which may arise from an alleged violation,<br/>misinterpretation, or misapplication of the Agreement. Both parties agree that these<br/>proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level</p>
<p>of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any teacher having a<br/>grievance to discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member of the<br/>administration, and to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by the<br/>Association, provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this<br/>Agreement and that the Association has been given an opportunity to review the<br/>adjustment and to state its views. If the grievant wishes, the Association may be present<br/>at such an adjustment and state its views. This provision does not apply to Level Four.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits<br/>specified at each level should be considered maximums and every effort should be<br/>made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all the<br/>steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school year and, if left unresolved<br/>until the beginning of the following school year could result in harm to the grievant, the<br/>time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior<br/>to the end of the school year or as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>C. Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal: Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve<br/>the issue by an informal discussion with the grievant’s immediate supervisor. The<br/>grievant has 10 working days from the date the unit member had or reasonably should<br/>have had knowledge of the event, action or inaction which led to the grievance. The<br/>informal conference shall be held within 5 working days of the request.</p>
<p>If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at level above the principal or immediate supervisor, the grievant shall<br/>submit such grievance in writing to the superintendent and the Association directly and<br/>the processing of such grievance will be commenced at Level Two.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: If the grievant is not satisfied with the results of the informal step he or she<br/>may, within five (5) working days after the response at the informal level, file a Level<br/>One grievance with the immediate supervisor. A level one grievance shall be<br/>submitted on the appropriate form and shall include the following:</p>
<p>A clear, concise statement of the grievance;</p>
<p>The circumstances involved;</p>
<p>The specific provision of the Agreement alleged to have been violated; and</p>
<p>The specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall communicate a decision to the grievant in writing within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the Level One grievance. If the supervisor does not respond within<br/>the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: In the event that the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level One,<br/>he or she may appeal the decision on the appropriate District designated form to the<br/>Superintendent or designee within ten (10) days. The appeal shall include a copy of the<br/>original grievance, the decision rendered, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons<br/>for the appeal. The Superintendent or designee shall communicate a decision within ten</p>
<p>(10) days of receiving the appeal. If the Superintendent or designee does not respond<br/>within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at<br/>Level Two, or if no written decision has been rendered within ten (10) working days<br/>after s/he had first met with the superintendent or his designee, the grievant may, within<br/>ten (10) working days after a decision by the superintendent or his designee, submit<br/>his/her grievance to the Board. The Board, within ten (10) working days after receipt of<br/>the request from the grievant, may conduct a hearing on the grievance in an effort to<br/>resolve it, and shall render a decision in writing within ten (10) working days.</p>
<p>The grievant has the right to bypass level three and proceed directly to level 4<br/>arbitration.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>5. Level Four: If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at<br/>the previous level, or if the grievant or Board has elected not to have the Board hear the<br/>grievance, the grievant may within ten (10) working days after a decision of the Board<br/>or after a decision of the Board or grievant not to have the Board hear the grievance,<br/>request in writing that the Association submit his/her grievance to arbitration. The<br/>Association, by written notice to the superintendent within ten (10) working days after<br/>receipt of the request from the grievant, may submit the grievance to binding<br/>arbitration.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choice of the arbitrator shall be made from a list supplied by the State Mediation<br/>and Conciliation Service. The arbitrator shall be chosen by the parties alternately<br/>striking names until only one remains. First party to strike shall be determined by<br/>lot.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth his/her findings of fact,<br/>reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator will be without<br/>power or authority to make any decision which requires the commission of an act<br/>prohibited by law or which is in violation of the terms of this Agreement. However,<br/>it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such financial<br/>reimbursement or other remedies s/he judges to be proper. The decisions of the<br/>arbitrator will be submitted to the employer and the Association and will be final<br/>and binding upon the parties of this Agreement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to per them<br/>expense, the arbitrator's travel and subsistence expenses, and the cost of any hearing<br/>room will be borne equally by the Employer and the Association. All other costs,<br/>with the exception of mandated costs, will be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Teachers to Representation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by either party against any grievant, any party in<br/>interest, any member of the Association, or any other participant in the grievance<br/>procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure, short of<br/>arbitration, by him/herself or, at his/her option, by a representative selected by the<br/>Association. If a teacher is not represented by the Association or its representatives, the<br/>Association shall have the right to review and state its views at all stages of the<br/>grievance procedure. When a decision is rendered, the Association shall be informed<br/>and given an opportunity to comment.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. Decisions rendered at Levels One, Two, and Three of the Grievance procedure will be<br/>in writing, setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore, and will be transmitted<br/>promptly to all parties in interest and to the president of the Association. Time limits</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>for appeal provided in each level shall begin the working day following receipt of<br/>written decision, or the date that written decision would be due in the case that no<br/>written decision is offered, by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the Association to attend a<br/>hearing during the day, the representative will, upon notice to his/her principal or<br/>immediate supervisor by the President of the Association, be released without loss of<br/>pay in order to participate in the foregoing activities. Any teacher who is requested to<br/>appear at a hearing as a witness shall be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance<br/>will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not 'be kept in the personnel file of any<br/>of the participants.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents will be agreed upon jointly by the<br/>Employer and the Association and given appropriate distribution by the Association so<br/>as to facilitate operation of the grievance procedure. The costs of preparing and<br/>reproducing such forms shall be borne by the Employer.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance may be withdrawn at any level without establishing precedent.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the Employer may renew and extend a teacher's leave for a maximum of<br/>one (1) year provided the other contract provisions are complied with.

<p>ARTICLE 9</p>
<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE PROGRAM</p>
<p>The Association and the district agree to establish a Catastrophic Leave Bank for all<br/>employees of the District. The Catastrophic Leave Bank (the Bank) is limited to the terms,<br/>conditions and purposes specified herein. Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or<br/>injury that is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time or that<br/>incapacitates a member of the employee's family, which incapacity requires the employee to<br/>take time off from work for an extended period of time to care for that family member, and<br/>taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the employee because he or she<br/>has exhausted all of his or her sick leave and other paid time off. (Ed. Code 44043.5).</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions: Every employee shall be given the opportunity to contribute to the Bank,<br/>but only contributors shall be allowed to draw from the Bank. Only those who have<br/>contributed to the bank are eligible participants in the Bank for that fiscal year.<br/>Contributions are irrevocable.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of contribution to the Bank by each participating employee for each<br/>fiscal year will be one (1) day of sick leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions to the Bank become the property of the Bank, even if not utilized, and can<br/>only be withdrawn under the terms and conditions of this regulation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer shall notify new probationary employees of the opportunity to donate at<br/>the time of hire. New employees will have 30 days after starting employment with the<br/>Employer to donate in order to be eligible to participate in that fiscal year. Regular,<br/>continuing employees must indicate their participation, on the form provided by the<br/>district, no later than October 1st of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Bank accrues 40 net days, no further annual contributions will be<br/>required from ongoing participants in order to sustain their eligibility to draw from the<br/>Bank. Voluntary deposits to the Bank shall not be requested again until a draw from the<br/>Bank is made and the total days accrued falls below 20. In such event, employees will<br/>be requested to re-enroll during the next September 1<sup>st</sup> to October 1<sup>st</sup> period as<br/>described in Section A3 above. New employees may continue to join even if the<br/>accrued amount of days in the Bank reaches 40. Continuing regular employees may<br/>initiate (or restart) their Bank eligibility during the next September 1<sup>st</sup> to October 1st<br/>period regardless of the number of days accrued in the Bank.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals: Withdrawals from the Bank can only be made when the contributor has<br/>exhausted all other available leave, including differential pay, to recover from a serious<br/>accident or illness to the employee, their immediate family, or individuals residing in the<br/>employee's household. The request must be accompanied with a doctor's statement</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the probable length of absence from work.</p>
<p>Employees covered under Worker's Compensation benefits are excluded.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A participating employee may qualify for a withdrawal from the Bank for a maximum<br/>of 20 days in any fiscal year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of withdrawal from the Bank, a &quot;day&quot; shall be recorded as the hourly/daily<br/>equivalent the employee serves in their regular assignment at the time of his/her<br/>contribution or withdrawal. The employee may withdraw a &quot;day&quot; at the same<br/>percentage s/he contributed.</p>
<p>C. Miscellaneous:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of the bank, a full day will be considered eight (8) hours. The District will<br/>convert the percentage of FTE of days donated in relation to eight (8) hours for<br/>purposes of determining net days in the Bank.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 15<sup>th</sup> of each year, the District shall provide notification of the status of the<br/>Bank to current Bank participants, including, but not limited to, total number of days<br/>accumulated in the Bank as of June 30<sup>th</sup> of the previous year, the total number of days<br/>used since the last reporting, and the balance of days available for use by participants<br/>for the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank shall be considered self-contained and limited by the employee contributions<br/>received and accrued over time. There shall be no catastrophic leave awarded, nor any<br/>obligation to provide such leave, when all days in the bank have been exhausted.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the<br/>Bank shall be returned to the then current participant pool proportionately.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10</p>
<p>SALARY</p>
<p>In the 2011-2012 school year, the District shall pay an off-the-schedule stipend, equivalent to a<br/>1.5% salary increase to all bargaining unit members. This stipend shall be paid in two<br/>installments in December 2011 and June 2012. If the Governor’s May Revision to the 2011-<br/>2012 State Budget, published on May 16, 2011, is approved and adopted, and the tax extension<br/>is also approved in the State Budget or by the voters by December 31, 2011, one percent (1%)<br/>of the above salary increase shall be added to the salary schedule effective July 1, 2012.</p>
<p>Contingency Reopener: If the district projects that the statutorily required reserve requirement<br/>of a 4% cannot be met in any school year during the term of this Agreement, the district shall<br/>promptly notify the Association in writing. If the contingency reopener is invoked, the parties<br/>agree to negotiate in good faith toward a mutually acceptable solution. If the parties are unable<br/>to reach agreement within thirty (30) calendar days of the notice, then the remedy shall be a<br/>temporary rollback in compensation not to exceed 5%. This rollback in compensation shall also<br/>apply to management employees.</p>
<p>As reserve requirements are statutorily prescribed, to comply with law, parties intend and<br/>expect that reserve requirements will be met by the end of the fiscal year in which the reopener<br/>is invoked. Consequently, any rollback shall result in a temporary salary schedule, applicable<br/>no longer than the end of the fiscal year in which the rollback is applied. The parties expect that<br/>during a year in which the rollback is applied, the District shall take such appropriate fiscally<br/>responsible actions, such as program reductions, expense reductions, reductions in force or<br/>other steps that are within its purview.</p>
<p>The following criteria shall be used to accrue additional units on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All units beyond the AB degree are based on semester units. Quarter units and CEUs will<br/>be converted to semester units at a rate of 2/3 to 1. If a bargaining unit member pays for the<br/>the units and all related expenses and the class is not during duty hours, the bargaining unit<br/>member shall be able to use those units toward the salary schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All units taken from an accredited institution with a minimum grade of C or passing shall<br/>qualify for advancement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional units may be earned through district-sponsored workshops. County Office of<br/>Education classes or other activities, workshops, or institutes which meet the requirements<br/>of this article so long as the employee is not particiating in a program during duty time or at<br/>District expense. Credit for these courses shall be approved by the coursework committee<br/>when related to current or anticipated classroom assignment or professional duties.</p>
<p>• Continuing Educational unit credits earned shall be granted “semester hour” credit<br/>for salary placement as 3 CEU credits = 2 semester units (or equivalent portion<br/>thereof.)</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>• Coursework and training offered where no college or CEU credit is available may<br/>earn District credit with the committee’s approval. The minimum number of in<br/>class hours for which CEU credit will be considered is ten (10) hours.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coursework committee shall consist of two(2) teachers appointed by the Association<br/>and 1 administrator. The function of the committee shall be to review application requests<br/>for credit pursuant to section C of this article. This committee shall meet once a year.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the course, the teacher must notify the district office by September 15<sup>th<br/></sup>and submit an official card or transcript showing the course number, title, number of units,<br/>and grade received by October 15<sup>th</sup>. Courses/units must have been completed within the<br/>previous school year to be eligible for application for salary advancement.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All courses completed after September shall apply for salary advancement for the following<br/>school year.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to five (5) years of credit for previous teaching experience shall be granted by the<br/>district superintendent. Additional credit may be granted upon recommendation by the<br/>district superintendent and approval of the board of trustees.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any step advancement on the Salary Schedule will not be granted until the certificated<br/>employee has completed an equivalent of 75% of the days required by the contract of<br/>employment.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time certificated employees, earning a pro-rated salary, during the 2007-2008 school<br/>year, shall earn a full step when determining the salary schedule placement for 2008-2009.</p>
<p>Beginning the 2008-2009 school year, part-time employees earning a pro-rated salary shall<br/>earn a full step of movement for purposes of salary schedule placement.</p>
<p>This agreement is not retroactive and shall affect placement for bargaining unit members<br/>beginning the 2008-2009 school year.</p>
