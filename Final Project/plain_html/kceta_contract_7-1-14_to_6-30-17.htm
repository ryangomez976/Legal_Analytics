<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons represented by said unit shall hereafter in this document be referred to as &quot;member of<br/>the unit&quot;.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>ARTICLE III - NEGOTIATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>No later than. September 15<sup>th</sup>, the parties will come together and develop a list of mutually-<br/>agreed upon interest based bargaining issues for the current school year, to be sun shined for<br/>public review and comment at the next Board meeting.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In years in which a multi-year agreement will be in force during the succeeding school<br/>year, the list of issues shall be drawn from up to three articles plus salary and benefits.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final year of an agreement, the list of issues may encompass the entire<br/>agreement.</p>

<p>The Association shall designate five (5) representatives who shall each receive release time<br/>without loss of compensation or sick leave for the purpose of preparing for and attending<br/>negotiations and impasse proceedings.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV ~ ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Members</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any members of the unit who is not a member of the Association shall pay to the<br/>Association a service fee proportionate to the percentage of time employed minus the<br/>yearly amounts for the CTA/NEA publications - CTA Action, NEA Reporter and<br/>Today's Education - and ABC political fond. The service fee includes the standard<br/>initiation fee, periodic dues and general assessments of the Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said service fee shall be a condition of employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the unit who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets<br/>or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee<br/>organizations shall not be required to join, maintain membership in, or financially<br/>support any employee organization as a condition of employment; except that such<br/>employee may be required, in lieu of a service fee, to pay sums equal to such service<br/>fee either to a nonreligious, non-labor organization, charitable fund exempt from<br/>taxation under Section 501 (c) (3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code, chosen by<br/>such employee from a list of at least three such funds, designated in the organizational<br/>security arrangement, or if the arrangement fails to designate such funds, then to any<br/>such fund chosen by the employee. Either the employee organization or the public<br/>school employer may require that proof of such payments be made on an annual basis<br/>to the public school employer as a condition of continued exemption from the<br/>requirement of financial support to the recognized employee organization. If such<br/>employee who holds conscientious objections pursuant to this section requests the<br/>employee organization to use the grievance procedure or arbitration procedure on the<br/>employee's behalf, the employee organization is authorized to charge the employee for<br/>the reasonable cost of using such procedure.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-members may use the payroll deduction method or pay the service fee directly to<br/>the Association. In the event that the member of the unit fails to comply with one of<br/>the aforementioned methods, the Association shall inform the District that the<br/>requirements of Section C of this Article should be implemented.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the unit who is a member of the Associ ation or who has applied for<br/>membership may sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing payroll<br/>deduction of unified membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments of the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to such authorization, the District shall deduct one-tenth or one-twelfth of<br/>such dues from the regular salary check of the member of the unit each month for ten<br/>(10) months.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such authorization shall continue in effect from year to year unless revoked in writing<br/>between June 1<sup>st</sup> and September 15<sup>th</sup> of any year. <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>5</p>
<p>4. Members of the unit who are employed and sign such authorization forms after the<br/>commencement of the school year shall pay the same monthly rate as other members,</p>
<p>C. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the unit who chooses to pay the Association directly or who revokes<br/>his or her payroll authorization shall transmit said service fee to the Association within<br/>thirty (30) days of initial and yearly employment or payroll authorization revocation,<br/>whichever is applicable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, within the time period specified above, a member of the unit does not pay a fee<br/>directly to the Association or submit a payroll deduction authorization, the District<br/>shall, upon notice from the Association, immediately begin automatic payroll<br/>deduction as provided in Education Code section 45061 and in the same manner as set<br/>forth in Section B of this Article.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a member of the unit revokes a dues or service fee authorization or fails to<br/>make arrangements with the Association for the direct payment of sendee fees,<br/>the District will deduct service fees until such time as the Association notifies<br/>the District that arrangements have been made for the payment of such fees.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to the authorization of<br/>the member of the unit (whether a membership fee or a service fee), the District<br/>agrees to remit such monies to the Association promptly.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to furnish any information needed by each to<br/>fulfill the provisions of this article. In addition, the Association agrees to provide<br/>proper Hudson notification to fee payers in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The Association agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the District harmless from any and all claims,<br/>demands, suits, attorney fees, or any other action arising from the provisions of the section or fi*om<br/>complying with any demand for deduction, termination or revocation hereunder. <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>6</p>
<p>ARTICLE V - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to grievances. Both parties agree that these proceedings shall be kept as<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure. The grievant may start at<br/>whichever level is appropriate to the grievance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by one or more members of the unit, or the Association, that he<br/>or she has been adversely affected by an alleged violation, misinterpretation or<br/>misapplication of this agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which the District administrative office is open.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Involved parties&quot; include, but may not be limited to, the grievant, the appropriate<br/>administrators and the Association's representative(s).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; may be one or more members of the unit or the Association asserting a<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;representative&quot; shall be a person chosen by the Association to represent the grievant.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Levels” are sequentially higher appeals in the chain of command. The grievant may<br/>start at whichever level is appropriate to the grievance.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after knowledge of or the occurrence of the act or omission which<br/>gives rise to the grievance, the grievant may meet with the appropriate administrator, either<br/>directly or in the presence of the Association's representative. Any persons named in the<br/>grievance shall be notified and shall have the option of meeting with the grievant and the<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level One - Appropriate Administrator</p>
<p>If the grievance has not been settled at the informal level, or if the grievant chooses not to<br/>use the informal level, the grievant may, within seven (7) days, submit a formal written<br/>grievance to the appropriate administrator requesting a written response. The administrator<br/>shall have seven (7) days to render a written decision.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level Two - Superintendent</p>
<p>If the grievance is not settled with the appropriate administrator, the grievant may, within<br/>seven (7) days, submit the written grievance to the Superintendent. The Superintendent<br/>shall have seven (7) days to render a written decision.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level Three - Grievance Mediation</p>
<p>a. If the grievant has not settled with the Superintendent, or if the time limits</p>
<p>expire without issuance of the Superintendent's written reply, the grievant and/or <sup>7</sup></p>
<p>7</p>
<p>the Association, within seven (7) days, may submit the grievance to non-binding<br/>mediation through the California Department of Industrial Relations, State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service (“SMCS”).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An impartial mediator from SMCS shall be selected jointly by the grievant and<br/>the District within seven (7) days of the receipt of the written request. In the<br/>event that the parties cannot agree, SMCS shall be requested to supply a panel of<br/>five (5) names. Alternate names shall be stricken until only one (1) remains.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediation shall commence at the convenience of the mediator. Mediation<br/>sessions shall be confined to school days. In order to make the most efficient<br/>use of the mediator’s time, mediation sessions shall extend beyond normal<br/>school hours, by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>d. The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be paid by SMCS. Any costs<br/>related to the mediator not paid by SMCS shall be shared equally.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any additional expenses incurred beyond those charged by SMCS shall be<br/>borne by the party incurring such expenses.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mediation, from start to finish, shall not exceed thirty-five (35) calendar days.</p>
<p>5. Formal Level Four - Arbitration</p>
<p>Decision to arbitrate.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant(s) is(are) not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Formal Level<br/>Three, the grievant may within ten (10) days of the last meeting with the mediator or within<br/>ten (10) days of the expiration of the timeline in Level Three above, submit a request to the<br/>Association Grievance Chairperson, requesting that the Association submit the grievance to<br/>binding arbitration. The Association Grievance Committee shall review the request and make<br/>a recommendation to the Association Executive Board. The Association Executive Board<br/>shall retain full and complete authority to determine whether or not it will forward the<br/>grievance to binding arbitration.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association Executive Board approves the request, the Association shall submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration by giving written notice to the Superintendent’s Office within twenty<br/>(20) days after the date the grievant makes the request to the Association.</p>
<p>Choosing an arbitrator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days after such written notices of submission to arbitration, a District<br/>representative and the Association shall attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable<br/>arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within the specified period, the<br/>Superintendent’s Office and the Association shall: <sup>8</sup></p>
<p>8</p>
<p>® Jointly request the California State Mediation and Conciliation Services to supply a panel<br/>of five (5) names of persons experienced in hearing grievances in public schools.</p>
<p>• Each party shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The remaining<br/>panel member shall be the arbitrator. The party who strikes the first name shall he<br/>determined by the Association striking first on all odd numbered grievances and the<br/>District striking first on all even numbered grievances</p>
<p>Costs.</p>
<p>d. The District and the Association shall equally share the costs for the services of the<br/>arbitrator, including per diem expenses, travel, and sustenance expenses, if any. The District<br/>and the Association shall split the costs of a reporter and/or transcripts. All other expenses<br/>shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>Location.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration hearing will be held in a location to be mutually agreed upon by the District<br/>and the Association. In the absence of a mutual agreement, the arbitration hearing will be held<br/>in the District offices.</p>
<p>Commencing Arbitration.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration will begin at the arbitrator’s convenience</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall hear evidence and render a decision on the issue or issues the parties<br/>submit to him/her. However, no issues or evidence shall be submitted to the arbitrator and the<br/>arbitrator shall not consider any issues or evidence that were not asserted and presented in the<br/>pri or steps of the grievance procedure. The arbitrator shall submit in writing to the District,<br/>the Association and the grievant, his/her findings and recommendations and shall set forth the<br/>arbitrator’s reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted within ninety (90) days of<br/>submittal of closing briefs or arguments.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will be without power or authority to make any decision which requires the<br/>commission of an act the law prohibits or which is violative or goes beyond the specific terms<br/>of the Agreement. The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the<br/>terms of this Agreement or written policies, rules, regulations and procedures of the District.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such financial<br/>reimbursement as he/she judges to be proper, but only to the extent the alleged grievance is<br/>about denied or lost pay and then limited to actual dollars denied or lost as is requested in the<br/>party’s submission statement</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Arbitrability. <sup>9</sup></p>
<p>j. If any questions arise as to the arbitrability of the grievance, the arbitrator will rule upon<br/>such question at least fifteen (15) days prior to conducting any hearing on the merits of the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>Arbitral Award.</p>
<p>k. The award of the arbitrator shall be binding on the grievant, the Association, and the District. On<br/>petition of either the Board of Education or the Association, a court of competent jurisdiction may<br/>review the award of the arbitrator. The court, on review, shall determine whether there was<br/>sufficient evidence to support the arbitrator’s findings and award.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits<br/>specified at each level should be considered to be maximums and every effort should<br/>be made to expedite the process. Tire time limits may, however, be extended by<br/>mutual agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all<br/>levels of the grievance procedure by the last working day of the school year, the time<br/>limits set forth herein shall be reduced so that the procedure may be completed prior to<br/>the end of the school year or within thirty-five (35) calendar days.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the unit may be represented at all stages of the procedure by himself<br/>and/or, at the member's option, by legal counsel and/or a representative of the<br/>Association. The Association shall be represented in any formal grievance and shall<br/>receive all formal documents and decisions.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms and other related documents will be developed jointly by the Association and<br/>the Superintendent and shall be available at the District office and posted on the<br/>district web site. (See Appendix C.)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All claims alleging a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of this agreement<br/>shall be considered grievable and shall proceed as such. A decision rendered at any<br/>level shall be considered final unless an appeal is made within the time specified. If a<br/>decision is not given to the grievant within the time limit, an appeal may be taken to<br/>the next level.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No party in interest shall take reprisals affecting the employment status of any member<br/>of the unit, party in interest, any Association representative, or any other participant in<br/>the procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An operational file shall be kept during the grievance by the appropriate administrator.<br/>At the conclusion of the grievance, this file shall not become a part of the District <sup>10</sup></p>
<p>10</p>
<p>personnel file of any participant and shall be kept confidential at all times.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for representative(s) designated by the Association to attend<br/>mediation during a school day, the President of the Association shall notify the<br/>appropriate administrator. The representative of the Association shall be released<br/>without loss of pay or sick leave to participate in the activity. Any member of the unit<br/>who is requested to appear in such mediation as a witness shall be accorded the same<br/>right.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievance may be brought directly to mediation by mutual consent between the<br/>Association and the Superintendent.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution of any grievance shall be documented in a settlement agreement with<br/>signed copies distributed to the grievant, the Association and the District. No<br/>agreement shall modify the terms of the existing contract.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>The procedure for filing a complaint because of an alleged violation, misinterpretation or<br/>misapplication of Board policies, which directly affect members of the unit, shall be the procedure<br/>outlined in Administrative Regulation 4144, approved by the Governing Board.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII ~ MEMBER OF THE UNIT EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of evaluation is for the district to assess the unit member's<br/>performance, sharing commendations and recommendations for improvement.</p>
<p>Specific areas of improvement should be noted and, if appropriate and necessary, a self<br/>improvement plan will be established after two unsatisfactory evaluations.</p>
<p>However, evaluation should be a continuous process leading to improved instruction and<br/>student success. The evaluator and unit member will work together to assure that the unit<br/>member is evaluated on his/her performance in the classroom, as it directly applies to the<br/>education given to the student and on non- instructional duties, which are necessary to the<br/>operation of the school. The goal of evaluation is to strive toward excellence in the<br/>classroom.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition of Temis:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation: The viewing of a staff member's performance, which is reduced to<br/>writing. It is understood that an observation has two components: first, a viewing of<br/>the performance in the classroom; and second, a written report.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitation: The vi ewing of a staff member's performance, which may, at the discretion<br/>of the evaluator, be reduced to writing.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Evaluation : A summary report of all written visitations and observations for the<br/>year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every first year probationary member of the unit shall be observed at least once. The<br/>final evaluation shall be discussed with the member of the unit and filed in the District<br/>Office no later than March 1<sup>st</sup> of the evaluation year. When any probationary member<br/>of the unit has received an unsatisfactory final evaluation, the District shall annually<br/>evaluate the member of the unit until he or she achieves a positive final evaluation, or<br/>is separated from the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every second year probationary member of the unit shall be observed by the site<br/>administrator no later than December 8<sup>th</sup> of each school year. Additional observations<br/>may be made at any time during the year but the final evaluation shall be filed in the<br/>District Office no later than March 1<sup>st</sup> of each year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every temporary member of the unit contracted for service at 75% or more of the<br/>school year shall be observed no later than February 1st or within forty (40) working<br/>days of the date of hire. Additional observations may be made any time during the<br/>year but the final evaluation shall be filed in the District Office no later than March I<sup>st<br/></sup>of each year. At no time may the total number of observations exceed the contractual<br/>agreements. Every temporary member of the unit contracted for service less that 75%<br/>of the school year shall be observed no later than forty (40) working days of the date<br/>of hire.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Members of the Unit</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation(s) and evaluations of permanent members of the unit shall occur at<br/>least once every two years by a designated District administrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final evaluation shall be discussed with the member of the unit and filed in<br/>the District Office no later than May 1 st of the evaluation year. When any<br/>permanent member of the unit has received an unsatisfactory final evaluation,<br/>the District shall annually evaluate the member of the unit until he/she achieves<br/>a positive final evaluation or is separated from the District. Only a member of<br/>the unit who has received two (2) unsatisfactory observations may be given an<br/>unsatisfactory final evaluation.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final notification shall be given no later than August 1st.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Site Staffing:</p>
