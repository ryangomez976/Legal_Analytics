The unit member or evaluator may withdraw<br/>consent for this evaluation cycle at any time. The<br/>determination to extend or withdraw consent by the District<br/>shall be at the sole discretion of the evaluator.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall be the management person to whom the unit<br/>member is immediately responsible who is so designated by the District<br/>management.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be evaluated as it reasonably relates to:</p>

<p>12.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>12.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member’s adherence to identifiable curricular<br/>objectives.</p>

<p>12.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other considerations related to the unit member’s<br/>employment.</p>

Three (3) benchmarks shall be<br/>selected within either Standard 1 or Standard 5 in section I of<br/>the Evaluation Form, three (3) benchmarks within either<br/>Standard 3 or Standard 4 in Section II of the Evaluation Form<br/>and three (3) benchmarks within Standard 2 and one (1)<br/>benchmark within Standard 6 of the Evaluation Form.

<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, circumstances may<br/>significantly change which may require modification of the original goals<br/>and objectives. Such modifications may be initiated by the evaluator or<br/>the evaluatee.

<p>employment according to the following provisions:</p>

<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have been employed full-time in a position requiring<br/>certification for at least ten years, of which the immediately preceding<br/>five years were full-time employment, all in the Lawndale School District.</p>
<p>14.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment must be exercised at the request of<br/>the employee and can be revoked only with the mutual consent of the<br/>employer and the employee, except that such employees shall be<br/>subject to layoff and dismissal for cause according to the provisions of<br/>the Education Code.</p>
<p>14.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the employee shall pay their respective share of the<br/>employee’s STRS contributions in an amount equal to the amount that<br/>would be contributed if the employee was in full-time status.</p>
<p>14.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be paid a salary which is the pro rata share of the<br/>salary he/she would be earning if he/she were full-time in the category of<br/>the part-time assignment but shall retain all other economic rights and<br/>benefits for which he/she makes the payments that would be required if<br/>he/she were full-time in the category of the part-time assignment.</p>
<p>14.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall receive health benefits as provided in Section 53201<br/>of the Government Code, in the same manner as a full-time employee.</p>
<p>14.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum part-time employment shall be the equivalent of one half<br/>of the number of days of service in a full-time position.</p>
<p>14.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may not participate in this retirement plan past the age of<br/>70 years, or for more than five years, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>14.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once an employee has elected to be on a part-time status, such<br/>employee cannot return to a full-time employment status, except by<br/>consent of the Governing Board.</p>
<p>LTA Contract 7/1/12 - 6/30/15</p>
<p>Page 40</p>
<p>14.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employees who are on part-time employment status will accrue<br/>seniority on the same prorated basis as their employment proration.</p>
<p>14.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final determination as to how many employees and which<br/>employees will participate in this program and which form of part-time<br/>employment rest within the sole discretion of the Governing Board. The<br/>District has the right to reject all new applicants in any given year.<br/>However, the District’s determination shall not be arbitrary or capricious.</p>
<p>Should the District find it necessary to choose between new applicants<br/>for participation in this program, the following criteria shall be applied to<br/>determine who is selected:</p>
<p>14.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legitimate identifiable educational needs of the District.</p>
<p>14.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of partner teacher, where applicable, with the<br/>appropriate credential and subject area or grade level<br/>experience as defined in Article 10.</p>
<p>14.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of a partner teacher, where applicable, who is<br/>compatible with the applicant.</p>
<p>14.12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal requirements, including credentials.</p>
<p>14.12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifiable skills and strengths.</p>
<p>14.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee serves a partial day under this program, the pro rata<br/>salary will be determined by using the fraction of instructional minutes<br/>taught compared to the instructional minutes in a full-time assignment at<br/>the same grade level. The part-time employee shall also be required to<br/>be on duty for the preparation period and to perform before and after<br/>school responsibilities on the same pro rata basis.</p>
<p>The normal day-to-day duties outside the classroom shall be contiguous<br/>to the instructional day of the employee. The employee may be required<br/>to perform non-contiguous duties or spend more than a pro rata amount<br/>of time in the case where full-time employees are required by the District<br/>to serve non-contiguous time and in cases where it would be<br/>administratively impractical to prorate the time, such as during Back-to-<br/>School Night, or required staff meetings. Such duties shall be specified<br/>in the Pre-Retirement/Part-Time Employment Agreement between the<br/>District and the eligible unit member.</p>

<p>Defining the Portfolio</p>
<p>The portfolio option is not a ‘showcase' or “best work' portfolio It is a 'learning' or “working&quot; portfolio. In a<br/>leaming/working portfolio, certificated staff gathers and reflect on selections of student work, assessments, etc,, in<br/>order to guide professional decision-making regarding next steps for improvement at the time of the selection.</p>
<p>The first selection represents initial information regarding the identified goals The reflection on that first selection<br/>should guide decision making for adaptations or improvements The remaining selections and reflections<br/>throughout the year continue that same process Collectively, at the end of the year, the selections and their<br/>accompanying written reflections show learning and growth overtime. This Is a leaming/working portfolio<br/>The Portfolio includes:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Professional Development Plan</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher selection of and written reflection on at least two artifacts throughout the year In<br/>support of the Professional Development Plan.</p>
<p>(See ‘Professional Standards and Portfolio Selections' and &quot;Reflection on the Portfolio Selection ” You may<br/>copy more reflection forms as needed.)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting with administrator and/or peers after the first selection to discuss the selection<br/>and the accompanying reflection.</p>
<p>The purpose of the meeting is to facilitate:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyzing the first selection for the portfolio in order to get a deeper understanding of it<br/>through dialogue and to get additional ideas for new strategies or improvements</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to or revising the first written reflection based on the analysis and dialogue</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making connections with other teachers regarding your process and topic</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Final Accountability Assessment</p>
<p>Certificated staff each writes his or her own self-assessment as the Final Evaluation<br/>Form. The administrator will add comments.</p>
