<p>11</p>
<p>7.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee bargaining sessions are private sessions. However, either party shall have<br/>the right to bring in any consultants it deems necessary. Such consultants shall be<br/>responsible to and directed by their sponsor.</p>

<p>extended in writing by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed within thirty (30) days prior to the last teaching day<br/>of any year, and if left unresolved, harms the grievant, the time limits set forth herein<br/>will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school<br/>year or as soon as is practicable.</p>

<p>9.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance<br/>shall be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of<br/>any unit member.</p>
<p>9.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents will be prepared by the<br/>Association and approved by the District and given appropriate distribution so as to<br/>facilitate operation of the grievance procedure.</p>

<p>17</p>
<p>9.6.8 A unit member may at any time present grievances to the employer, and have such<br/>grievances adjusted, without intervention of the Association, as long as the adjustment is<br/>reached prior to arbitration and such adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of<br/>this Agreement. If any employee presents a grievance on his/her own behalf, the<br/>Association shall have the right to present and state its views at all grievance<br/>meetings.
