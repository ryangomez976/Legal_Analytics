<p>ARTICLE 1:</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The articles and provisions in this agreement constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>agreement (“Agreement”) by and between the Governing Board or Board of Trustees -<br/>referred to as “Board” of the Oakley Union School District (“District”) and the Oakley<br/>Union Teachers Association, CTA/NEA, an employee organization.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2:_DURATION OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>This Agreement shall become effective as of the date of its execution and shall<br/>continue in full force until Midnight, June 30, 2014. This Agreement shall not be<br/>amended orally and it is expressly understood that it shall expire on the date indicated<br/>and no portion of the Agreement shall continue in effect after that date.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3:_RECOGNITION</p>

As designated representative, the Association<br/>shall represent certificated personnel engaged in full or part-time teaching under<br/>contract with the District, including the following: General Education Classroom<br/>Teachers, Special Day Class Teachers, Teachers on Special Assignment and<br/>Instructional Support Providers.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;teacher&quot; refers to any professional employee who is in the bargaining unit<br/>as defined above and who is covered by this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “pilot” is a temporary program concluding on a specific date. Both parties will<br/>meet at least 30 days prior to termination date to decide whether to extend or revise<br/>the pilot. Upon mutual agreement, the pilot will become contractual.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “end of the instructional day” is defined as the latest dismissal time at a<br/>school, excluding Kindergarten.</p>
<p>4. “Prep” is time provided during the instructional day when teachers are not<br/>responsible for student instruction or supervision.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5:</p>
<p>NEGOTIATIONS PROCEDURES</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Spring of the calendar year in which this Agreement expires, the Association<br/>shall present in writing its initial proposals. Proposals shall be presented to the<br/>District at an open public meeting. The District will respond within 30 calendar days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negotiations shall be mutually scheduled.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to release members of the Association from their scheduled<br/>duties for a maximum of one-hundred-eighty (180) hours to serve on the<br/>Association's bargaining team without loss of pay or benefits. It shall be understood<br/>negotiations are normally scheduled for a full work day, at minimum, and substitutes<br/>shall be compensated entirely at District expense. The District and Association may<br/>employ, at their sole discretion, consultants to assist in the negotiations process. It<br/>is expressly understood for negotiations scheduled during the regular work day that<br/>neither negotiating team shall exceed six (6) individuals including any consultants,<br/>and shall at all times include at least four (4) unit members. Any of the above<br/>restrictions may be waived by mutual consent.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District agrees to provide the Association with the placement of all unit members on<br/>the negotiated salary schedule when requested.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACADEMIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FREEDOM</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All instruction shall be fair, accurate, objective, and appropriate to the age and<br/>maturity of the student(s) and sensitive to community needs. Academic freedom is<br/>essential and the District acknowledges the fundamental need to protect unit<br/>members from any censorship, which might interfere with the performance of their<br/>teaching functions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall have reasonable freedom in classroom presentations and<br/>discussions and may introduce appropriate political, religious or otherwise<br/>controversial material relevant to course content.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing teaching functions, unit members shall have reasonable freedom to<br/>express their opinions in an objective manner. In accordance with current Board<br/>policy, unit members shall not utilize their positions to indoctrinate students with their<br/>own personal, political, and/or religious views.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7:</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION RIGHTS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to post notices of activities and materials of<br/>organizational concern on Association bulletin boards, one of which shall be<br/>provided in each school in an area frequented by teachers. The Association may<br/>use District mail services and employee mailboxes for Association communications.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the sole and exclusive right to have membership dues,<br/>initiation and service fees deducted for members of the bargaining unit. The District<br/>shall, upon appropriate written authorization from any employee in the unit, deduct<br/>and make appropriate remittance to CTA for dues and service fees.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit who are not members of CTA on the effective date<br/>of this Agreement and employees who become members of the bargaining unit<br/>shall, either within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement or their employment,<br/>apply for membership in and execute the appropriate written authorization for dues<br/>or service fee deduction as a condition of their employment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event any member of the bargaining unit revokes an authorization for<br/>deduction of dues or service fees, the District shall notify the Association within five<br/>(5) workdays of receipt of that revocation. Without the reinstatement of the<br/>authorization, the District shall terminate the employee ten (10) workdays from the<br/>date of notification to the Association.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any member of the bargaining unit belongs to a recognized religious sect, which<br/>forbids its members to belong to or pay a representational fee to any employee<br/>organization, that employee shall be exempted from this provision upon the<br/>presentation to the District of a notarized statement declaring such fact. An amount<br/>equal to the representational fee shall be donated to a recognized charity.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to indemnify and hold the District harmless from any and all<br/>claims, demands or suits or any other action arising from the provisions of Sections<br/>2, 3, 4 and 5 above.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an authorized representative of the Association desires to transact business on<br/>school premises, he shall first report to the school office. The transaction of<br/>Association business shall not take place during the teacher work day and shall be</p>
<p>limited to the duty-free lunch period or to that time prior to or after the teacher work<br/>day.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A grievance is a formal written allegation by a unit member or the unit who claims to<br/>have been adversely affected by an alleged violation of the specific provisions of this<br/>Agreement. Any member of the bargaining unit shall have the right to present a<br/>grievance as specified below. The intent of these procedures shall be to settle the<br/>matter being grieved at the lowest possible level. The steps of the procedure shall be:<br/>INFORMAL DISCUSSION:</p>
<p>Principal/Supervisor: A unit member who believes he has a grievance shall discuss it<br/>first with his Principal or supervisor within five (5) school days of the event in an attempt<br/>to resolve the matter informally.</p>
<p>Level 1: Principal/Supervisor</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as a result of this informal discussion, the matter is not resolved, the grievant shall<br/>set forth his grievance in writing within five (5) school days of the date of the informal<br/>discussion and present it to the Principal or supervisor specifying:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific nature of the grievance and the contract line, clause or section<br/>alleged to have been violated;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of previous discussions relative to the allegation(s);</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date and time of presentation to the Principal or supervisor;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relief sought in the matter.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principal or supervisor shall communicate his decision to the employee in writ¬<br/>ing within five (5) school days after receiving the written grievance. The decision<br/>shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of previous discussions held on the matter;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale behind the decision.</p>
<p>Level 2: Superintendent</p>
<p>If the grievance remains unresolved, the grievant may, no later than five (5) school<br/>days after receipt of the Principal or supervisor’s decision, request a review by the<br/>Superintendent. All previous documents shall be submitted to the Superintendent with<br/>a request for review and he shall render his decision no later than ten (10) school days</p>
<p>after receipt of the appeal. The Superintendent may indicate a designee to review the</p>
<p>Principal or supervisor’s decision.</p>
<p>Level 3: Board</p>
<p>If the grievance is still unresolved, the grievant may, no later than five (5) school</p>
<p>days following receipt of the Superintendent’s review of the Principal or supervisor’s</p>
<p>decision, appeal to the Board.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall submit all previous documents to Board with his appeal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall hear the matter at a regular meeting in Closed Session, unless the<br/>grievant desires otherwise, within twenty (20) school days of receipt of the request.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be entitled to representation at the hearing and shall have the<br/>right to make a presentation to the Board on his allegations.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall inform the employee, in writing, regarding its decision in the matter<br/>within five (5) school days of the hearing.</p>
<p>Level 4: Arbitration</p>
<p>1. In the event the matter remains unresolved, the grievant may, no later than fifteen<br/>(15) calendar days after receipt of the Board’s decision, appeal to the arbitration<br/>procedure described below. Such procedures shall be subject to the following<br/>limitations:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for memoranda of understanding signed and agreed upon by the parties,<br/>this Agreement sets out expressly all the restrictions and obligations assumed by<br/>the parties and no implied restrictions or obligations are inherent in this<br/>Agreement or were assumed by the parties in entering into this Agreement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering whether a matter is subject to arbitration, a fundamental principle<br/>shall be that the Board retains all its rights to manage the school system, subject<br/>only to the express limitations set forth in this Agreement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter will be considered arbitrable unless the issue constitutes a grievance<br/>under the definition of a grievance set forth above. No court or arbitrator shall or<br/>may proceed under any presumption that a request to arbitrate is arbitrable<br/>except under such conditions.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed between the parties that no court or arbitrator shall direct arbitration<br/>on any other issue between the parties to the Agreement and such arbitration</p>
<p>shall be expressly limited to procedural matters contained in this Agreement. It is<br/>further agreed the award of the arbitrator shall be restricted to the determination<br/>of whether or not there has been a violation of a specific procedure in one of the<br/>sections of this Agreement, and the steps, if any, to be taken by the Board to<br/>provide relief to the grievant.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall limit himself to the issues submitted and shall have no<br/>authority in any case to add to, subtract from, or alter any provision of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's award shall be binding upon the parties.</p>
<p>2. An appeal to arbitration shall state in reasonable detail the nature of the dispute and<br/>the specific remedy sought by the grievant. It shall also include copies of all<br/>previous documents related to the dispute. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt<br/>of the appeal to arbitration, the parties to this Agreement shall meet at a mutually<br/>agreeable time and endeavor to mutually agree upon an arbitrator to hear the case.<br/>If the parties fail to agree upon an arbitrator, they shall jointly request the California<br/>State Conciliation Service to furnish a panel of five (5) capable arbitrators. Each<br/>party shall have the right to reject one (1) panelist. The Association and the Board<br/>shall alternately strike names from the agreed panel, with the Association striking the<br/>first name in the odd numbered cases, and the remaining individual shall be the<br/>arbitrator. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the<br/>Board and the Association. It is understood the Association shall be the sole and<br/>exclusive employee organization designated to represent grievants in the bargaining<br/>unit during the term of this Agreement. In the event a grievant is represented by<br/>himself or by an attorney, the Association shall be notified upon receipt of the<br/>request for review at the Superintendent’s level and shall be permitted to be present<br/>at all meetings. Copies of all correspondence shall also thereafter be forwarded to<br/>the Association. It is understood:</p>
<p>a. Failure to file or appeal grievances within the specified time limits shall constitute<br/>a waiver and settlement of the grievance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the Board’s representative to answer within the time limits provided at<br/>any step of this procedure will automatically advance the grievance to the next<br/>step of this procedure.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either the Board or the<br/>Association from agreeing to submit a grievance directly to arbitration.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Board nor the Association shall subject any grievant, or employees<br/>appearing on behalf of or in opposition to such a grievant, to reprisals for<br/>participation in the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance papers shall not be filed in employee’s file.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments and applicable rules and regulations of the Board shall remain in<br/>effect through the grievance process.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No member of the bargaining unit shall be penalized in salary or fringe benefits<br/>for participation in grievance or arbitration hearings held during such member’s<br/>work day.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>Members shall authorize the District to make necessary deductions for membership</p>
<p>dues. Plans and programs may include, but are not limited to, annuities, IRS Section</p>

<p>ARTICLE 11: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEAVES</p>
<p>Section 1: Sick Leave</p>
<p>1. The District shall provide for compensated leave of absence from duty for any<br/>unit member who is absent from duty because of accident, illness or quarantine,<br/>as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are employed on a full-time basis are entitled to ten (10) days<br/>of sick leave each school year, seven of which can be personal necessity,<br/>commencing on the first day of employment.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused sick leave shall accrue from year to year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to specify the manner of verifying the legitimacy of<br/>leave taken and the discipline to be enacted for misuse of sick leave. The District<br/>may require a physician's verification of illness if misuse is suspected, when a<br/>teacher has used sick leave for five (5) or more consecutive days, or when the<br/>pattern of absences indicates possible abuse. Employees may receive a warning for<br/>the first misuse or abuse dependent upon the severity.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and OUTA wish to comply with Education Code §44977 and Education<br/>Code §44978.1. In summary these sections provide the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are absent because of illness or accident beyond their<br/>accumulated sick leave entitlements will receive their daily rates of pay less<br/>differential pay for up to five (5) school months per incident. Differential pay is<br/>currently $145/day and will be adjusted annually. Please call the Human Resources<br/>office for the differential pay amount as the District may annually adjust this amount.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month period shall run<br/>consecutively.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be provided more than one five-month period per illness<br/>or accident. However, if a school year terminates before the five-month period is</p>
<p>exhausted, the employee may take the balance of the five-month period in a<br/>subsequent school year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a certificated employee has exhausted all available sick leave, including<br/>accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent due to illness or accident for a<br/>period beyond the five-month period, and the employee is not medically able to<br/>resume the duties of his or her position, the employee shall be placed on a<br/>reemployment list for a period of 24 months if the employee is on probationary<br/>status, or for a period of 39 months if the employee is on permanent status. The 24-<br/>month or 39-month period shall commence at the expiration of the five-month period.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the employee is medically able, during the 24- or 39-month period, the<br/>certificated employee shall be returned to the next available vacancy for which he or<br/>she is credentialed and qualified.</p>
<p>4. Whatever the claim of disability, no day of absence shall be considered a sick leave<br/>day on which unit members or the Association have engaged in a concerted work<br/>stoppage, unless the unit member was legitimately absent and provides verification<br/>as the District may require.</p>
<p>Section 2: Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>1. Bereavement leave shall be afforded to employees up to five (5) days for the death<br/>of any member of the employee's immediate family.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required court appearance. The site administrator must be given at least two (2)<br/>days prior notice.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discretionary Leave</p>
<p>Discretionary leave days shall not be used as part of a concerted work stoppage.<br/>The administrator may not grant approval of these days if the leave will extend a<br/>school holiday or break. The site administrator must be given at least two (2) days<br/>prior notice, unless the reason is for illness of a family member. These days do not</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>accumulate beyond the fiscal year. These days shall be deducted from personal<br/>necessity days.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) days may be taken at the discretion of the employee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) additional days may be taken at the discretion of the employee<br/>for family/personal obligations (i.e. illness of a child, legal business) which do not<br/>otherwise meet Personal Necessity criteria. The current established daily substitute<br/>rate as stated in Appendix B shall be deducted.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may take five (5) days of leave upon the birth or adoption of a child.<br/>The site administrator must be given at least two (2) days prior notice.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to specify the manner of verifying personal necessity<br/>exists in each case in which such leave is requested.</p>
<p>Section 4: Maternity Leave</p>
<p>A unit member may take sick leave for maternity reasons, subject to the following</p>
<p>conditions [Note: For further information regarding maternity leave, contact your site</p>
<p>administrator or the District personnel office]:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity leave shall begin on the date indicated in a written statement signed by a<br/>duly licensed physician or other competent practitioner that the unit member is no<br/>longer able to perform her duties.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity leave shall end on the date indicated in a written statement signed by a<br/>duly licensed physician or other competent practitioner that the unit member is<br/>physically able to return to work.</p>
<p>Section 5: Jury Duty</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall request leave no less than two (2) working days after receiving<br/>notice that they have been called to serve as a juror. This leave shall be granted<br/>with pay. Unit members shall turn over to the District the portion of the stipend<br/>received for such duty, which is not for mileage expenses or transportation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who is called for jury duty on one of his/her work days, but through action<br/>on his/her part is able to defer jury service to a non work day shall receive $95 per<br/>day for his/her jury duty service to a maximum of five (5) days. Appropriate</p>
<p>verification of deferral and service must be provided prior to payment. He/She may<br/>also keep the stipend for this same period of time.</p>

<p>The District and OUTA will cooperate in the design and implementation of the</p>
<p>Oakley Peer Assistance Review Program (OPARP).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of the OPARP is to improve the quality of instruction through expanded<br/>and improved professional development and peer assistance. The program will<br/>serve as a critical feedback mechanism to allow experienced teachers to assist<br/>teachers in need of development in subject matter knowledge and/or teaching<br/>strategies.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panel</p>
<p>A Peer Assistance Review Panel comprised of four teachers selected by OUTA, and<br/>three administrators selected by the District, will be chaired by the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction who will serve as a non-voting<br/>member. Not withstanding the above, annually the District may modify the size of the<br/>panel provided that the change is consistent with the requirements of Education<br/>Code §44502 and does not become smaller than the original composition of four<br/>teachers and three administrators.</p>
<p>a. The Panel will select Peer Counselors in accordance with Education Code 44501<br/>and 44502, as needed, and will be responsible for adopting rules and procedures</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>to effect the provisions of this Article which will include defining &quot;unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation,&quot; determining compensation, setting meeting schedules, providing<br/>training, etc.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel will work with Peer Counselors to develop remediation plans for<br/>participating teachers including, at a minimum, written performance goals aligned<br/>to the District’s student learning goals and a time frame for regular reporting.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel will further create a plan which will offer, but not be limited to,<br/>observations of other teachers, additional staff development, demonstration<br/>lessons, and other individual assistance from available resources.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel will periodically evaluate the program and make adjustments as<br/>needed to improve service delivery.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel, Peer Counselors, and others involved in this process are reminded of<br/>the sensitivity of information they will receive. This information is highly<br/>confidential and must be shared carefully at all times.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administrators will conduct additional evaluations and observations during the<br/>review year and share these with the peer counselors. The program will foster and<br/>strongly encourage a cooperative relationship between the Peer Counselor,<br/>Participating Teacher, and Site Administration. Written records of plans, progress,<br/>and evaluations or observations will be placed in the teacher’s personnel file.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating teachers include teachers referred as a result of unsatisfactory<br/>evaluations (Referred) and volunteer teachers seeking peer assistance and not<br/>performance review (Volunteer).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year of support a referred teacher who has received a negative evaluation<br/>and has not shown improvement will be referred to the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Human Resources. Voluntary teacher participants will not be referred beyond the<br/>panel.</p>
