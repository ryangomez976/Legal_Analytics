<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Step. Within ten (10) days after the grievant knew or reasonably<br/>should have known of the circumstances that form the basis for the grievance,<br/>unit member shall first discuss the grievance with the site or other appropriate<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One. In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance, unit member may submit the grievance formally in writing to the<br/>site or other appropriate administrator or designee within five (5) days of the<br/>informal decision, but in any case no longer than seventeen (17) days from the<br/>time the grievant knew or reasonably should have known of the circumstances<br/>which form the basis for the grievance.

<p>(5) days after the grievant has first met with the Superintendent or his<br/>designee, the grievant may, within five (5) days after a decision by the<br/>Superintendent or his designee, request in writing that the FEDERATION<br/>submit the grievance to arbitration.</p>

<p>The costs of mediation are to be borne equally.</p>
<p>7.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FEDERATION, by written notice to the Superintendent within ten (10)<br/>days after receipt of the request from the grievant, may submit the grievance to<br/>binding arbitration.

<p>The parties may select a mutually acceptable arbitrator. Should they be<br/>unable to agree on an arbitrator within five (5) days of the<br/>FEDERATION'S submission of the grievance to arbitration, either of<br/>the parties may request a list of arbitrators from the SMCS.

<p>9.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of transfer, job sites are defined by distance rather than<br/>program. A move from Gateway’s main campus to a site in Fillmore would be<br/>a transfer. A short walk between two facilities would not. Generally speaking,<br/>if the distance requires driving, it is a different job site.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOLUNTARY TRANSFER PROCEDURES</p>
<p>9.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for transfer in response to the advertised vacancy shall be made to<br/>Human Resources Department on the appropriate VCOE form within 10 days<br/>of the posting.</p>
<p>9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member requesting a transfer during the year should inquire about the<br/>calendar changes that could result in a shorter or longer work year. In the event<br/>of a shorter year, a unit member would make less than the contractual amount<br/>and would also have a prorated year of service credit for STRS.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRITERIA FOR TRANSFER</p>
<p>The selection will be based on the criteria listed below:</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Credential</p>

<p>ARTICLE 10. EVALUATION AND PROFESSIONAL REVIEW</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VCOE and the FEDERATION intend to create an evaluation process with two tracks.<br/>Track I is designed to be used for probationary unit members and non-probationary<br/>unit members not utilizing the second track. Track II (the Alternative Evaluation)<br/>encourages evaluators and evaluatees to design personalized systems of evaluation to<br/>promote professional growth such as but not limited to self-appraisal, journals, partner<br/>observations, peer appraisals, parental and student commentary, portfolio of<br/>accomplishments, peer coaching, and the like. The new employee orientation will<br/>incorporate a discussion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>10.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those instances when an administrator working with a teacher in Track I, II, or III,<br/>observes concerns in the classroom or performance, there shall be timely feedback to<br/>the unit member.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First year probationary and temporary unit members shall be evaluated by the<br/>Administration in writing at least once each school year, by May 1.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second year probationary unit members shall be evaluated by the Administration in<br/>writing no less than every other year, by March 1.</p>
<p>10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a probationary unit member receives formal notice of nonre-election, he/she will be<br/>allowed to resign if that resignation occurs prior to formal action by the County<br/>Superintendent of Schools. VCOE will notify the probationary unit member by<br/>assuring that the nonre-election box on the evaluation form is checked. The checking<br/>of this box does not disallow the acceptance of the resignation.</p>
<p>10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every non-probationary unit member shall be evaluated by the Administration in<br/>writing no less than every other year, by May 1.</p>
<p>10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than October 15 of the year in which evaluation is to take place, the evaluator<br/>and the evaluatee shall meet to review the evaluation process.</p>
<p>TRACK I</p>
<p>10.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VCOE Standards-based Evaluation Document (Appendix D) shall be the<br/>evaluation instrument.</p>
<p>10.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Track I evaluation shall be based upon at least two observations, each lasting no<br/>less than thirty (30) consecutive minutes followed by an observation conference and a<br/>written observation summary. The observation conference shall be scheduled at a<br/>mutually agreeable time.</p>
<p>10.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee shall be given an opportunity to discuss thoroughly the evaluation with<br/>the evaluator prior to placement of the final evaluation in the Personnel File. The</p>
<p>evaluatee has the right to have a representative of the FEDERATION present at such a<br/>meeting. The evaluatee may request an additional meeting after the final written<br/>evaluation has been received.</p>
<p>10.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee shall have the right to respond in writing to any evaluation, observation,<br/>or conference summary, and to date, sign, and attach such response thereto, before<br/>such evaluation, observation or conference summary is placed in the evaluatee's<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>10.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall review any “Unsatisfactory” or “Needs Improvement” comments<br/>with the evaluatee prior to being written into the final evaluation summary.</p>
<p>10.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any “Unsatisfactory” or “Needs Improvement” areas are noted, the evaluator shall<br/>be responsible for establishing with the evaluatee a program of remediation which will<br/>include recommendations for improvement and direct assistance in implementing<br/>recommendations for improvement. Assistance may include, but not be limited to,<br/>peer assistance, partner teachers, visitations, training and administrative feedback.</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory notations will require subsequent year evaluations. (E.C. 44664a)<br/>Needs Improvement notations will require completion of a remediation plan.<br/>Subsequent improvements will be noted by an attachment to the evaluation in the<br/>evaluatee’s personnel file.</p>
<p>10.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evaluations shall be entered in the evaluatee's personnel file.</p>
<p>10.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If remedial action eliminates the unsatisfactory areas, the evaluation(s) citing such<br/>areas shall be sealed in the evaluatee's file after four (4) years.</p>
<p>TRACK II - ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION (NON-PROBATIONARY)</p>
<p>10.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose. The alternative evaluation process is designed to encourage whatever<br/>the mind can conceive in support of instruction and professional growth. The process<br/>offers to unit members who have consistently demonstrated effective performance an<br/>alternative to the regular evaluation process. The process is flexible in order to<br/>encourage unit members to grow in self-chosen areas of interest that promote and<br/>relate to student learning and instructional leadership through individual or group<br/>efforts. The goals, objectives, projects and criteria established under Track II serve as<br/>the certificated performance evaluation in lieu of Track I and Track in. The process is<br/>structured to strengthen collegial relationships and cooperation and to decrease<br/>isolation.</p>
<p>Guidelines. Guidelines were developed to enhance the opportunity for certificated<br/>unit members to commit to ongoing continuous improvement and professional<br/>accountability through a structured Track n evaluation process. The goals of the</p>
<p>process are to:</p>

<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VCOE shall not base any action against a unit member on materials that are not<br/>validly contained in the unit member's personnel file, with the exception of<br/>circumstances contemplated by Ed. Code sections 44942 and 44939.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any complaint considered to have sufficient merit by the administration to justify<br/>further communication with the unit member or inclusion in the unit member's official<br/>personnel file shall be reported to and discussed with the unit member as soon as<br/>possible.</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be provided any negative or derogatory material before it is<br/>placed in unit member’s official personnel file.

<p>ARTICLE 14. UNIT MEMBER SAFETY</p>
<p>14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety is a continuing concern to both VCOE and unit members. VCOE shall provide<br/>a unit member with safe working conditions and take all reasonable proactive and<br/>preventative actions to so provide. Safety at specific sites will be addressed through<br/>the Site Norming Process.</p>
<p>14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VCOE and unit members shall conform to and comply with all health, safety and<br/>sanitation requirements imposed by State and/or Federal law or regulations adopted<br/>under said law including those prescribed by CAL-OSHA.</p>
<p>14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are to report any alleged unsafe or potentially unsafe conditions to their<br/>immediate supervisor. Oral communications shall be confirmed in writing. Upon<br/>receipt of the unit member's written report of unsafe conditions, the<br/>Superintendent/designee will acknowledge in writing what action, if any, will be taken<br/>on the reported condition. Such response shall occur within five (5) days.</p>
<p>14.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First aid materials shall be available at all facilities maintained by VCOE. All<br/>materials must be approved by the safety committee and kept in adequate supply.</p>

VCOE<br/>shall give legal and other related assistance in accordance with applicable law for any<br/>assault upon the unit member while the unit member is fulfilling assigned duties.</p>
<p>14.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When absence arises out of or from such assault or injury which occurs within the<br/>scope of employment, the unit member shall not forfeit any sick leave or personal<br/>leave until the appropriate industrial leave provisions have been exhausted.</p>
<p>14.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent required by law or otherwise, in the absolute discretion of VCOE, when<br/>a unit member is included in litigation which asserts liability for non-intentional or<br/>non-willful acts occurring within the course and scope of employment, VCOE will<br/>provide a defense if the unit member gives the VCOE control of the litigation<br/>including but not limited to the right to compromise and settle the matter on terms<br/>acceptable to VCOE, provided that the unit member is not required to contribute to the<br/>settlement.</p>
<p>14.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimbursement or replacement of property. The property of unit members, such<br/>as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dentures, watches, or articles of clothing necessarily worn<br/>or carried by the unit member may be paid for, repaired, or replaced by County School<br/>Service Fund when any such property is damaged in the line of duty without fault of<br/>the unit member. If the property is damaged beyond repair, the actual value of such<br/>property may be paid. The value shall be determined as of the time the damage<br/>occurred. Payments for amounts over five hundred ($500) dollars may be authorized</p>
<p>14.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VCOE agrees to allow for a reimbursement for personal equipment damaged or<br/>stolen to a maximum amount of $500 per occurrence. This amount will be reimbursed<br/>only if the unit member had prior written approval for the use of the equipment from<br/>the site administrator and the loss or damage occurred without negligence on the part<br/>of the unit member. A unit member must also make claim of any available personal<br/>insurance (such as homeowner's or rental) before being eligible to receive<br/>reimbursement.</p>
<p>14.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subrogation. In the event the unit member is paid the costs of repairing or replacing<br/>such property, or the actual value, the County School Service Fund shall, to the extent<br/>of such payments, be subrogated to any right of the unit member to recover<br/>compensation for the damaged property.</p>
<p>14.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automobile Damage. A unit member may be reimbursed up to $500.00 per incident,<br/>for automobile damage incurred while the automobile is being used for business<br/>related travel. This reimbursement shall be available only to the extent damages are<br/>not covered by the unit member's personal automobile insurance (such as the<br/>deductible) or are not the responsibility of an identifiable third party.</p>
<p>The incident shall be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency and/or the<br/>unit member's department head, or a management unit member in the Business Office,<br/>immediately. Failure to report the incident to the department head or management<br/>unit member in the Business Office within 24 hours shall invalidate the claim unless<br/>the accident results in personal injury which reasonably precludes the unit member<br/>from reporting. Business Office staff may inspect the damage and/or request a copy of<br/>the insurance report or other evidence of the amount of insurance company payments<br/>may also be required. A copy of the police report may also be required, if applicable.<br/>No reimbursement shall be provided for wear and tear, breakdown of parts, or<br/>puncture of tires. The loss shall be directly and unquestionably the result of a specific<br/>incident resulting through no fault of the unit member. No reimbursement shall be<br/>allowed for acts of vandalism or other damages inflicted by a third party by other than<br/>accidental causes. No reimbursement shall be provided if any local, state or federal<br/>laws were being violated by the unit member at the time of or immediately preceding<br/>the accident.</p>
<p>14.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions to the above policy may be made in instances where substantial justice so<br/>warrants.</p>
<p>14.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisis Prevention Training. Unit members who work in classrooms with students<br/>with Moderate to Severe Disabilities or Emotional Disturbances shall be trained in<br/>crisis prevention strategies. This training shall be made available to other unit<br/>members upon their request and the approval of VCOE.</p>
<p>14.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety Committee. The FEDERATION shall have a representative on the VCOE<br/>Safety Committee.</p>
<p>14.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized Physical Health Care Procedures. Specialized physical health care<br/>procedures shall be performed by staff members who have been appropriately trained<br/>and supervised by the school nurse. These procedures shall be authorized by the<br/>individual student's physician in writing. Such procedures will primarily be provided<br/>by paraeducators. Teachers will receive training and provide these procedures as<br/>backup to paraeducators. All current administrators who have students needing<br/>specialized health care at their site will be trained as soon as possible. New<br/>administrators will be trained, if feasible, at the first regularly scheduled training<br/>opportunity but not later than one year after date of hire.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>15.1 TUBERCULOSIS EXAMINATIONS. Examinations for tuberculosis will be<br/>required every four (4) years except as indicated by Education Code Section 49406 or<br/>its successor. Such examinations shall be paid for by the VCOE, provided the unit<br/>member receives the examination at a VCOE designated facility.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>At the heart of any successful human effort involving shared responsibilities is the individual<br/>internalization of the mission of the institution. An educator's workday is determined by the<br/>professional responsibilities of unit member's job. Rigid work rules on time expectations that are<br/>not accepted as group norms tend to diminish an individual's commitment to the mission. VCOE<br/>and the FEDERATION therefore agree to a professional work day with the specific workday<br/>expectations to be a product of a site-based group process for determination of site specific<br/>norms. The following criteria are adopted to guide a site's decision about specific work hours:</p>

<p>16.2</p>
<p>SITE SPECIFIC NORMS - WORK DAY AND OTHER TOPICS</p>
<p>Each site shall establish its norms for the workday within the prescribed workweek.<br/>Topics such as professional development, testing, parent meetings, IEPs, Single Plan for<br/>Student Achievement, School Safety Plan, and school calendar shall also be addressed<br/>under the norming process.</p>
<p>Included in these norms will be a procedure for assuring compliance with the norms.</p>
<p>Near the end of the school year, there shall be a group evaluation of the norms based<br/>upon any changing needs of the students and program for the upcoming school year.</p>
<p>16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING NORMS</p>
<p>Prior to May 15<sup>th</sup> each site shall meet as a group to establish/review its norms based upon<br/>any changing needs of the students and program for the upcoming school year. By<br/>October 15<sup>th</sup> of the upcoming school year each site shall review and endorse their site<br/>norms. The agreed to norms shall be in writing and be distributed to all affected parties.</p>
<p>The norming group shall reflect administration and all unit members or a representative<br/>group of all unit members and administration and shall use the interest-based process for<br/>determining its norms. This process may be facilitated by an off-site person trained in the<br/>interest-based process.</p>
<p>The group decisions shall be by consensus when possible. Each group shall determine a<br/>fallback process to be used in the event that consensus cannot be reached. This fallback<br/>process shall be agreed upon prior to beginning the discussion of establishing site norms.</p>
<p>Norms may be reviewed or modified by group decision at the site at any time</p>
<p>16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CERTIFICATED SPECIALIST UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>Certain certificated specialist unit members in non-teaching positions may not be<br/>incorporated in the site group norming process although their positions necessitate<br/>continued availability to students, parents, and other agencies. These positions may<br/>require being on site for the expected forty (40) hours. These educators shall meet with<br/>their administrator (with a facilitator if necessary) to determine on-site hours based upon<br/>the above criteria.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>ARTICLE 17. WORK YEAR AND PROFESSINAL DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>17.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COUNTY OFFICE CALENDAR. The length of the school term and holidays shall<br/>be consistent with the generally accepted practices of Ventura County School<br/>Districts.</p>

<p>33</p>
<p>17.3.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not all requests for extended days can be accommodated, the<br/>unit member teaching that class shall be offered the opportunity<br/>for working the extended year. If the unit member declines,<br/>then scheduling differences between or among unit members<br/>will be settled by a mutually signed agreement or by seniority.</p>
<p>17.3.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there not be need for staffing during the extended year,<br/>priority will be given to current appropriately credentialed unit<br/>members to fill vacancies in other VCOE departments in order<br/>to work the extended year.

<p>17.5 CEC WORK YEAR</p>
<p>The work year for CEC staff shall include the number of assigned instructional days<br/>plus three (3).</p>
<p>17.6 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>For VCOE’s students the most important asset is our teaching force. And the most<br/>important investment we can make in a school system is to ensure that teachers<br/>continue to learn. Continuous, high-quality professional development is essential to<br/>meeting the goal of high standards of learning for every child.</p>
<p>Professional development is a continuous process of individual and collective<br/>examination and improvement of practice. It should empower individual educators<br/>and communities of educators to make complex decisions; to identify and solve<br/>problems, and to connect theory, practice, and student outcomes. Professional<br/>development should also enable teachers to offer students the learning opportunities<br/>that will prepare them to meet world-class standards in given content areas and<br/>successfully assume adult responsibilities for citizenship and work.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should deepen and broaden knowledge of content.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should provide a strong foundation in the pedagogy of</p>
<p>particular disciplines.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should provide knowledge about the teaching and</p>
<p>learning processes.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should be rooted in and reflect the best available</p>
<p>research.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of professional development should be aligned with the standards and</p>
<p>curriculum that teachers use.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should contribute to measurable improvement in</p>
<p>student achievement.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should be intellectually engaging and address the</p>
<p>complexity of teaching.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should provide sufficient time, support, and resources</p>
<p>to enable teachers to master new content and pedagogy and to integrate<br/>this knowledge and skill into their practice.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should be designed by teachers in cooperation with</p>
<p>experts in the field.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should take a variety of forms, including some we have</p>
<p>not typically considered.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development should be job-embedded and site specific.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>VCOE’s support for quality teaching and putting research into practice makes for a<br/>powerful partnership in efforts to surround teachers with excellent professional<br/>development and opportunities for professional collaboration.</p>
<p>Mandatory training will reflect the Superintendent's Professional Development Goals<br/>and be coordinated through the department professional development committee,<br/>(which includes administration, teachers, and other unit members), and approved by<br/>the Superintendent.</p>
<p>17.7 MANDATORY TRAINING</p>
<p>Because of the mutual commitment to continuity of instruction, VCOE and the<br/>FEDERATION agree, when feasible, to schedule mandated training sessions outside<br/>of the regular student day but within the teacher work day. Mandatory training will be<br/>coordinated through the professional development committee.</p>
<p>17.9 PILOT PROGRAM TO BE A RE-OPENER IN 2009-10.</p>
<p>The Professional Development Program will allow for a number of options. Two<br/>days of the authorized* training would be mandatory. [^Authorization will be based<br/>upon the judgment of VCOE that there were adequate funds available to operate these<br/>professional development programs ] One of the two days would be structured into<br/>one full day or two 31/2 hour pupil-free days (the equivalent of one full day paid at<br/>per diem). There would be another mandatory day that could be structured into 7<br/>hours, 31/2 hours or any other combination of time that would total seven hours. This<br/>time would also be paid at the per diem rate. VCOE approved professional<br/>development time beyond the two days specified above would be voluntary and paid<br/>at the hourly rate applicable to Step One, Column A. Unit members included in the<br/>professional development plan include all staff in Special Education and Court and<br/>Community Schools. Excluded staff would be Audiologists, CEC, and SELPA staff.<br/>Professional Development for CEC would be voluntary and paid at the hourly rate as<br/>set out above.</p>
<p>* Authorization would be based upon the judgment of VCOE that there were adequate<br/>funds available to operate these professional development programs.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>ARTICLE 18. CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size is regulated by a number of factors, including but not limited to funding by<br/>program, safety of students and staff, location of student population, State Law, unit<br/>member workload, instructional strategy/setting and student learning. Student loading<br/>(number of students permitted in classroom) will be determined by the square footage of<br/>the classroom and other relevant factors.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent it is reasonably possible, class sizes should be equitably assigned within a<br/>particular program.</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event class size becomes a problem at a particular site, department, or program, a<br/>site/department/program-based committee that includes the assigned site administrator,<br/>shall address ways to improve the situation.</p>
<p>Gateway Class Size Procedure</p>
<p>The ratios set out below for Gateway are guidelines not maxima.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size/teacher/student ratios were established based on the premise that class size and<br/>student attendance (daily student production/independent study) are interdependent. In<br/>order to generate the requisite amount of ADA per year daily students must attend a<br/>minimum of 75% of the instructional days and Independent students must produce a<br/>minimum of 70% of their contract work.</p>
<p>18.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Gateway Seat Time Option, the standard configuration will be<br/>24:1 (24@ 75% = 18 regular attendees). Exceptions to the standard<br/>configuration (based on square footage or other factors) will be<br/>determined by a committee comprised of site administration and two<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>18.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Gateway Independent Study Option, the standard configuration<br/>will be 36:1 not to exceed 27 ADA and will be generated by an<br/>Independent Study teacher during the course of a school year.</p>
<p>18.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Gateway Combination Daily/Independent Study option, i.e. where<br/>caseload is split between daily students and independent study students,<br/>the standard configuration will be 31:1.</p>
<p>18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site Administration will set as a goal that class loads be consistent with established ratios.</p>
<p>18.6 The budgeted and actual average daily attendance (ADA) will be reviewed when<br/>caseload (class size) is identified as an issue. When the actual ADA meets or exceeds the<br/>budgeted ADA for an individual teacher, a committee composed of the site administrator<br/>and at least two teachers (one of whom will include the impacted teacher) will meet. The<br/>committee will meet and make recommendations to the appropriate branch head for<br/>possible changes, additions and/or movement of students to more equitably distribute<br/>caseload (class size). The committee will meet and make recommendations within 15<br/>calendar days after verified attendance data is available. In the interim, while the<br/>committee is doing its analysis, the site principal may add short term/temporary staff to</p>
<p>alleviate unanticipated class load imbalances, redistribute students to other teachers or<br/>other reasonable solutions. The timeline may be modified by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>38</p>

<p>member's major or minor will be granted salary column<br/>approval when and if the authorization is gained on the unit<br/>member's credential.</p>
<p>25.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval of courses taken will be the responsibility of the site<br/>administrator and the VCOE Human Resources Office. Courses,<br/>workshops, inservices or projects that will be used for salary advancement<br/>must be approved prior to participation. To qualify for salary<br/>advancement credit, these activities must take place outside of working<br/>hours and be paid by the unit member. Pre-approval and verification are<br/>documented using Application Form for Salary Schedule Advancement<br/>Credit.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inservice—inservice activities include those sponsored by VCOE or<br/>other agencies that directly pertain to unit member's employment and are<br/>conducted outside of normal business hours.

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work experience (CEC only)—only work experience performed after<br/>date of hire will be considered. Work experience will be counted only if<br/>documented by the employer as a learning experience rather than current<br/>knowledge. Unit members must also show how their curriculum will<br/>improve as a result of the work experience.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training—training attended must be directly related to unit member<br/>subject area and be of significant value to the department. A concise<br/>description of knowledge to be gained by unit member's attendance must<br/>be stated on the application form.

A maximum of three units may<br/>be earned annually through work experience. Inservice, projects, and<br/>training credits will accumulate at a rate of fifteen hours per semester<br/>unit. A maximum of three units may be earned for each inservice,<br/>project, or training occurrence.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 26. HEALTH BENEFITS</p>
<p>26.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VCOE contributes the basic and extended benefits for eligible certificated unit members<br/>and their families for major medical and dental insurance plans.</p>
<p>26.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All regular and probationary unit members working half time or more are eligible for<br/>coverage in proportion to the percentage that their hours are to full time. This proration is<br/>applicable to those unit members hired after March 7, 1994, the date of ratification of<br/>original agreement. Temporary unit members working half time or more are eligible for<br/>coverage if the temporary assignment is expected to be six months or more in length.<br/>Those serving in apprentice type positions and substitutes (not members of the unit) are<br/>not eligible for coverage regardless of the percent of time worked on a daily, weekly or<br/>monthly basis.</p>
<p>26.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be eligible for coverage on the first of the month following the first<br/>month the unit member works at least ten (10) days in a qualifying status. Unit members<br/>shall not gain eligibility during summer school or extended session classes. Eligibility<br/>for VCOE paid health and dental insurance coverage shall expire on the last day of the<br/>month in which the unit member last works.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 27. LEAVES</p>
<p>27.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SICK LEAVE</p>
<p>Every certificated full-time unit member shall be entitled to leave of absence with pay<br/>because of illness or injury, whether such absence arises out of or in the course of<br/>employment. The amount of leave per school year shall be credited as follows: one day<br/>for each month of service. These days are not in addition to those allocated in 27.16.</p>
<p>27.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel employed for less than full time shall be entitled to that portion of ten (10) days<br/>leave of absence as the number of days employed per week bears to five (5) days. This<br/>provision does not apply to hourly employees.</p>
<p>27.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave - Extended School Year: Unit Members employed to teach in the summer<br/>session shall be granted one (1) day sick leave for each eighteen (18) days worked. Sick<br/>leave earned during summer session may be accumulated from summer to summer. Sick<br/>leave earned in VCOE during the academic school year shall not be applicable during<br/>extended school year.</p>
<p>27.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave may be used when disability is the result of pregnancy. For this purpose,<br/>disability is limited to the period of time the unit member is reasonably certified by a<br/>medical doctor to be unable to perform the duties of the unit member's position.</p>
<p>27.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member does not take the full amount of leave allowed in any school year, the<br/>amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year, with such additional days as the<br/>VCOE may allow.</p>
<p>27.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person is absent from duties on account of illness or accident for a period of five<br/>(5) school months or less, whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the<br/>employment of the unit member, the amount deducted from the salary due for any month<br/>in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum which was actually paid a substitute<br/>employee employed to fill the position during the absence. If no substitute employee was<br/>employed, the deduction shall be the amount which would have been paid to the<br/>substitute had one been employed. VCOE shall make every reasonable effort to secure<br/>the services of a substitute employee.</p>
<p>27.6.1 &quot;Sub difference&quot; pay referenced in Section 27.6 above, shall apply after all<br/>current and accumulated sick leave has been exhausted.</p>
<p>27.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members utilizing sick leave for more than five (5) consecutive days may be<br/>required to furnish a certificate issued by a medical doctor or other satisfactory evidence<br/>of illness. A certificate from the unit member’s physician may be accepted, or the unit<br/>member may be required to submit to a physical by a physician designated by the County<br/>Superintendent. If required to see a physician designated by the County Superintendent,<br/>it shall be at the expense of the County Superintendent.</p>
<p>If any unit member fails to furnish a certificate or refuses to submit to a physical upon<br/>request, the unit member's sick leave may not be in effect and the days of absence may be<br/>considered unauthorized personal leave without pay.</p>
<p>The evidence of treatment and the need therefore as a practice of the religion of any well<br/>recognized church or denomination will be treated in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>
<p>27.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a certificated employee has exhausted all available sick leave, and continues to be<br/>absent on account of illness or accident for a period beyond the five-month period, and<br/>the employee is not medically able to resume the duties of his or her position, the<br/>employee shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a reemployment list for a<br/>period of 24 months if the employee is on probationary status, or for a period of 39<br/>months if the employee is on permanent status.</p>
<p>27.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the employee is medically able to return during the above time<br/>period, the employee shall be returned in a position for which he or she is<br/>credentialed and qualified.</p>
<p>27.8.2. Staff members replaced on a temporary basis shall have the right to return<br/>to their original site at the conclusion of the temporary assignment.</p>
<p>Pilot Sick Leave Incentive Program</p>
<p>A pilot Sick Leave Incentive Program will be instituted starting with the 2006-2007 school year<br/>that will provide the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300 stipend for unit members using 0-1 sick days per year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$150 stipend for unit members using 2-3 sick days per year.</p>
<p>Continued use of this program is contingent upon the teacher group as a whole utilizing a<br/>minimum of 100 fewer days than the previous year. This is because the program is designed to<br/>be revenue neutral so that available funds are maximized on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>27.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CATASTROPHIC LEAVE</p>
<p>27.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may donate eligible accrued leave benefits to an individual<br/>unit member when that unit member or a member of unit member<br/>immediate family suffers from a catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>27.9.1.1. Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate the unit member for an extended<br/>period of time, or that incapacitates a member of the unit<br/>member's family which incapacity requires the unit member to<br/>take time off from work for an extended period of time to care</p>

<p>The VCOE and the VCFT agree to modify the Discretionary Personal Necessity<br/>Leave process to allow for a limited number of days to be used either the day before<br/>or after a holiday.</p>
<p>There shall be allocated a total of 3 days for Special Education, 1 day for Court<br/>Schools, 2 days for Community Schools, and 2 days for CEC for the following<br/>holidays: Independence Day (Court Schools only), Veteran’s Day, Thanksgiving,<br/>New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Day, Lincoln’s Day,<br/>Presidents’ Day, Spring Recess Day, and Memorial Day.</p>
<p>Unit members with Sixty-one (61) to one hundred (100) days accumulated sick leave<br/>will be entitled to use one of their five DPNL days for allocated DPNL “before or<br/>after” day. Unit members with one hundred-one (101) or more days accumulated sick<br/>leave will be entitled to use two of their seven DPNL days for an allocated DPNL<br/>“before or after” day.</p>
<p>Requests for DPNL allocated before or after days must be filed not later than thirty<br/>days prior to the requested date and must be approved or denied within five (5)<br/>working days of the filing deadline. Multiple requests for DPNL will be determined<br/>on the basis of the number of accumulated days of sick leave on file in the Business<br/>Office the last month prior to the request. DPNL requests will be filed with the<br/>Director of Special Education and the Associate Superintendent, Student Programs &amp;<br/>Services. This provision is excluded from the Grievance Process.</p>
<p>27.17.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discretionary Personal Necessity Leave days (DPNL) are leave days a unit<br/>member may use at his or her own discretion, without providing written or<br/>verbal justification for said leave. Unit members will earn Discretionary<br/>Personal Necessity days based on the number of sick leave days<br/>accumulated and recorded on the September pay warrant. The following<br/>scale will be used to determine Discretionary Personal Necessity Leave<br/>days:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One (1) to thirty (30) days accumulated sick leave = three (3) DPNL<br/>days.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirty-one (31) to sixty (60) days accumulates sick leave = four (4) DPNL<br/>days.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty-one (61) to one hundred (100) days accumulates sick leave = five<br/>(5) DPNL days.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred-one (101) or more days accumulated sick leave = seven (7)<br/>DPNL days.</p>
<p>27.17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPNL days must be approved by the supervisor/administrator and require</p>

DPNL cannot be used to<br/>extend holidays or vacations, to seek or engage in remunerative employment<br/>or for concerted activities.</p>
<p>There will be no carry over of DPNL days from year to year. DPNL may<br/>be used in 1/2 or in whole day increments. No more than two (2) DPNL<br/>days may be used consecutively. DPNL cannot be used when employed<br/>on a daily pay rate for days over contract.</p></td></tr>

<p>Leave because of serious health condition that makes the<br/>unit member unable to perform the essential functions of<br/>unit member position.</p>
<p>Both father and mother may take leave for the birth, or<br/>placement for adoption or foster care, of a child. In addition,<br/>an expectant mother may be entitled to leave prior to the birth<br/>of a child for prenatal care purposes if her condition makes her<br/>unable to work. Circumstances may also require leave prior to<br/>the actual placement of a child for adoption or foster care, for<br/>example, to attend counseling sessions, appear in court or<br/>consult with unit member attorney in connection with the<br/>placement of a child.</p>
<p>If both the husband and wife are employed by the VCOE, the<br/>aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both are<br/>entitled is limited to 12 workweeks during any 12-month<br/>period for the birth or placement for adoption or foster care of<br/>the unit members' child, or to care for a parent with a serious<br/>health condition. This limitation does not apply to leave taken<br/>by either spouse to care for the other who is seriously ill and<br/>unable to work, to care for a child with a serious health<br/>condition, or for his or her own serious illness.</p>
<p>Leave to care for a family member includes both physical and<br/>psychological care, including providing comfort and<br/>reassurance which would be beneficial to a seriously ill child or<br/>parent receiving inpatient care; or, making arrangements for<br/>third-party care of a family member.</p>
<p>A &quot;serious health condition&quot; includes an illness, injury,<br/>impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:</p>
<p>Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or in<br/>consequent to a hospital, hospice or residential medical care<br/>facility;</p>
<p>Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school<br/>or regular daily activities of more than three calendar days, that<br/>also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision</p>
<p>of) a health care provider; or</p>
<p>27.18.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or<br/>long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if<br/>not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of<br/>more than three calendar days or for prenatal care.</p>
<p>27.18.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing supervision by a health care provider when the<br/>parent, child, spouse or unit member are severely ill but may<br/>not be receiving continuing active care or treatment (e.g. when<br/>suffering from Alzheimer's, late stages of cancer or a severe<br/>stroke).</p>
<p>&quot;Continuing treatments&quot; include:</p>
<p>27.18.3.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or more visits to a health care provider;</p>
<p>27.18.3.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or more treatments by a health care<br/>practitioner (e g. physical therapist) on referral<br/>from, or under the direction of a health care<br/>provider; or</p>
<p>27.18.3.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single visit to a health care provider that<br/>results in a regimen of continuing treatment<br/>under the supervision of the health care provider<br/>(e g. medication therapy).</p>
<p>Intermittent leave or reduced work schedule leaves may be<br/>allowed when the absence required is not due to a condition<br/>that is incapacitating at that point in time (e.g. appointments for<br/>cancer treatments, physical therapy, prenatal care). When<br/>leave is taken because of the birth or the placement of a child<br/>for adoption or foster care, intermittent leave or reduced<br/>workload schedule will not be approved if the intermittent<br/>leave or reduced workload schedule will adversely impact the<br/>office or department of the unit member.</p>
<p>If a unit member requests intermittent leave or reduced<br/>workload leave to care for a spouse, child or parent or for the<br/>unit member's own serious health condition, the unit member<br/>may be required to temporarily transfer to an available<br/>alternative position for which the unit member is qualified and<br/>that:</p>
<p>a) has equivalent pay and benefits; and</p>
<p>b) has better accommodates recurring periods of leave than<br/>the regular position of the unit member.</p>
<p>Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically<br/>necessary are not &quot;serious health conditions,&quot; unless inpatient<br/>hospital care is required. Absence because of a unit member's<br/>substance abuse, without treatment, does not qualify for FMLA<br/>leave.</p>
<p>27.18.4 Paid/unpaid Leave: Leave provided by FMLA in excess of available<br/>accrued paid leave shall be unpaid. Any available paid accrued leave shall<br/>be used prior to unpaid leave (e.g. vacation, comp time or sick leave) for<br/>the unit member. Sick leave available for illness of a family member,<br/>under provisions of the Personal Necessity Leave and Catastrophic Leave<br/>policies, may be used prior to unpaid leave, at the discretion of the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>27.18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health and Dental Insurance Benefits: Health care and dental benefits<br/>coverage shall be continued during the 12 weeks FMLA leave period<br/>under the same terms and conditions as applicable to all other unit<br/>members. Upon expiration of FMLA leave entitlement, if additional<br/>unpaid leave is authorized, continuation of health care and dental benefits<br/>coverage shall be allowed with the unit member paying all costs of<br/>coverage or as may be allowed in other applicable policies.</p>
<p>27.18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to Return from FMLA Leave: If a unit member indicates unit<br/>member intent not to return from leave (including at the start of the leave),<br/>or if the unit member fails to return from leave, paid health and dental<br/>coverage will cease unless the unit member does not return because of the<br/>continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which<br/>would entitle the unit member to FMLA leave, or other circumstances<br/>beyond the unit member's control, (such as where a unit member's spouse<br/>is unexpectedly transferred to a new job location, someone other than an<br/>immediate family member has a serious health condition which the unit<br/>member needs to care for, or the unit member is laid off while on leave).<br/>The unit member's desire to stay with a family member even though the<br/>family member no longer requires the unit member's care, or a mother's<br/>decision to stay home with a newborn child and not return to work, do not<br/>qualify as &quot;other circumstances beyond the unit member's control&quot;.</p>
<p>Except as provided above, if a unit member fails to return after expiration<br/>for eligibility for FMLA leave, the unit member shall pay the full cost of<br/>coverage for health and dental benefits during the entire period of unpaid<br/>FMLA leave. Any amounts due under this section may be deducted from</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>any sums due the unit member (e.g. unpaid wages, vacation pay, etc.).<br/>Failure to reimburse the VCOE for the cost of coverage during the period<br/>of the unpaid leave shall result in termination of coverage.</p>
<p>If a unit member is unable to return to work because of the continuation,<br/>recurrence or onset of a serious health condition, the unit member shall<br/>provide medical certification of such claim. The certification shall be<br/>issued by the health care provider of the unit member or by health care<br/>provider of the unit member's child, spouse or parent if the unit member is<br/>unable to return to work because of the need to take care of one of these<br/>individuals. The certification shall indicate that the unit member is<br/>prevented from performing the functions of the position or is needed to<br/>care for the family member on the date the leave expired. If a requested<br/>certification is not provided within 30 days, the cost of coverage provided<br/>during the period of unpaid FMLA leave shall be due and payable.</p>
<p>27.18.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Member Status While On Leave: FMLA leave does not constitute<br/>a break in service for purposes of longevity and/or seniority. Seniority<br/>shall not be earned for any period of time on unpaid leave. Unit members<br/>returning from leave shall return with no less seniority for purposes of<br/>layoff, recall, vacation accrual or other seniority related benefits.</p>
<p>27.18.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Certification/Recertification:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the</p>
<p>health care provider of the individual requiring care shall be provided<br/>initially upon request for FMLA leave. The certification shall indicate the<br/>estimated duration of the need for leave. Periodic updates or<br/>recertification may be required upon expiration of the period of leave<br/>originally estimated or every 30 days, if requested by the Personnel<br/>Office.</p>
<p>The VCOE may, at its own expense, require the eligible unit member to<br/>obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved<br/>by the VCOE. When the second opinion differs from the first, the VCOE<br/>may require, at its own expense, that the unit member obtain the opinion<br/>of a third health care provider designated and approved jointly by the<br/>VCOE and unit member. The opinion of the third health care provider<br/>shall be considered final and binding on the VCOE and unit member.</p>
<p>If leave is foreseeable, medical certification must be provided within<br/>fifteen days after receipt of the unit member's request for leave. If the unit<br/>member fails to provide certification, the leave may be denied until<br/>certification is provided. If the leave is not foreseeable, the certification<br/>shall be provided within fifteen days, or as soon as is practicable under the<br/>circumstances. Failure to provide certification within a reasonable time<br/>under the pertinent circumstances may result in denial of continuation of</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>the leave.</p>
<p>27.18.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance Notice Required: If the event necessitating the leave becomes<br/>known to the unit member more than 30 calendar days prior to the need<br/>for a leave, the unit member shall provide notice as soon as unit member<br/>learns of the need for a leave — at a minimum, 30 days written advance<br/>notice.</p>
<p>If the event necessitating the leave becomes known to the unit member<br/>less than 30 calendar days prior to the unit member's need for a leave, the<br/>unit member shall provide as much advance notice as possible, and, at a<br/>minimum, written notice no more than five working days from learning of<br/>the need for the leave.</p>
<p>If the need for a family care leave is foreseeable, due to a planned medical<br/>treatment or planned supervision of a child, parent or spouse with a<br/>serious health condition, the unit member shall provide reasonable<br/>advance notice of the need for the leave and consult with the supervisor<br/>regarding the scheduling of the treatment or supervision so as to minimize<br/>disruptions to the school/department. Any such scheduling shall be<br/>subject to the approval of the health care provider of the family member.</p>
<p>Prior to granting a leave under this policy, medical certification as<br/>identified above, may be required.</p>
<p>27.18.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstatement upon Return from Leave: Upon return from FMLA<br/>leave, a unit member shall be restored to the position held when the leave<br/>commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment<br/>benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, provided the<br/>unit member is able to perform the essential duties of the position.</p>
<p>If the FMLA leave was due to the unit member's own serious health<br/>condition, prior to returning to work the unit member shall provide a<br/>certification from the health care provider that the unit member is able to<br/>resume the essential duties of the position.</p>
<p>27.18.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remedies for VCOE Violation of the Act: If a unit member's rights<br/>under the FMLA have been violated, the unit member may file a<br/>complaint with the Secretary of Labor, the Fair Employment and Housing<br/>Commission, or file a private lawsuit within two years after the last action<br/>which the unit member contends was in violation of the Act, or three years<br/>if the violation was willful.</p>

<p>27.19 SABBATICAL LEAVE</p>
<p>27.19.1</p>
<p>27.19.2</p>
<p>27.19.3</p>
<p>27.19.4</p>
<p>27.19.5</p>
<p>27.19.6</p>
<p>Sabbatical leave may be granted in order that a unit member may engage<br/>in professional study. Sabbatical leave will be granted only to enhance the<br/>professional growth of the candidate. The sabbatical leave committee, a<br/>committee with equal representation from the FEDERATION and<br/>management, shall be responsible for making recommendations for the<br/>acceptance or rejection of leave proposals to the Superintendent. The<br/>management members of the sabbatical leave committee shall be<br/>appointed by the Superintendent or his designee. The FEDERATION<br/>shall appoint its representatives.</p>
<p>Sabbatical Leave Application. The application shall include the reasons<br/>for requesting the leave, the length of leave desired, and the potential<br/>enrichment to the educational programs of VCOE. Any unit member<br/>eligible for Sabbatical Leave shall make application to Human Resources<br/>no later than March 1. The Committee shall consider the applications and<br/>make its recommendation to the Superintendent or designee no later than<br/>March 28 who shall respond to the candidates no later than April 1.</p>
<p>The number of unit members on Sabbatical Leave during any one (1)<br/>semester shall not exceed two unit members. If more than one eligible<br/>unit member applies for Sabbatical Leave during any one (1) semester, the<br/>granting of such leave shall be governed by priority of application,<br/>reasonable distribution of applicants by departments, seniority, relative<br/>merits or reasons for leave, and whether applicant has been granted<br/>previous leave.</p>
<p>Any unit member, upon return to the VCOE after a sabbatical leave, will<br/>resume a position within the scope of his or her credential.</p>
<p>A unit member is expected to return to serve VCOE for two times the<br/>length of the paid leave. Each unit member who has been on a sabbatical<br/>leave shall file with the Superintendent a written report not later than thirty<br/>(30) days after return to active duty on the professional value of the<br/>experience gained and the manner in which such experience or knowledge<br/>gained may be used for the benefit of VCOE educational programs. Unit<br/>members will be required to post a bond to receive monthly payments. If<br/>no bond is purchased, the unit member will be paid one half of the money<br/>when half of the required service is completed and the other half when all<br/>of the required service has been performed.</p>
<p>All unit members will be eligible for Sabbatical Leave. Any unit member<br/>who has satisfactorily completed seven (7) full years of service in VCOE<br/>shall be eligible to apply for Sabbatical Leave once in each eight (8) years.</p>
<p>Sabbatical Leave shall be granted for not less than one (1) full semester</p>
<p>27.19.7</p>
<p>nor more than two (2) full consecutive semesters. Leave for fractional<br/>part of a semester is not permitted.</p>
<p>27.19.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member on Sabbatical Leave, who has complied with the<br/>provisions under which such leave was granted, shall receive as<br/>compensation the difference between the amount paid for a substitute<br/>taking the place of the unit member and the amount the unit member<br/>would have been paid. If more than one unit member is granted leave, the<br/>average of the difference between the amounts paid for substitutes and the<br/>unit members shall be paid to each unit member on sabbatical leave. If no<br/>specific replacement is employed, the salary calculated for deduction<br/>purposes shall be the average salary of all temporary teachers hired for the<br/>year calculated on February 1.</p>
<p>27.19.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave shall count as a regular period of service, and shall not<br/>interrupt the unit member’s progress on the salary schedule. The unit<br/>member shall receive fringe benefit coverage in the same manner<br/>previously received by that unit member provided that the required<br/>payment is made by the unit member on terms to be arranged with VCOE<br/>prior to the date the leave is scheduled.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>ARTICLE 28. EFFECTS OF LAYOFF</p>
<p>28.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAY-OFF PROCEDURE. When the VCOE proceeds with a layoff and/or<br/>reemployment in accordance with the statutory requirements or Education Code<br/>Section 44955, et seq, the below provisions shall apply:</p>
<p>28.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice to the FEDERATION. Within seven (7) days of the VCOE's adoption<br/>of the required Resolution the VCOE shall notify the FEDERATION in<br/>writing of this action.</p>
<p>28.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written request from the FEDERATION, the VCOE shall provide the<br/>FEDERATION, as soon as it is available, with a list of the positions to be<br/>eliminated.</p>
<p>28.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENTITLEMENT TO LEAVE AND FRINGE BENEFITS</p>
<p>28.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each noticed unit member who has utilized unit member allowable Personal<br/>Necessity Leave may apply to the Superintendent for up to two (2) additional<br/>days of paid leave, to be deducted from sick leave, for securing other<br/>employment.</p>
<p>28.2.1.1 The request for additional leave must include a statement of<br/>needs regarding the time and date of the leave.</p>
<p>28.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laid-off unit member shall be entitled to district-paid fringe benefits through<br/>September following unit member layoff. In the event of a Special Education<br/>Department reorganization, benefits will be coordinated between VCOE and<br/>the receiving district so that there will be no interruption to the effected unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>28.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REASSIGNMENTS RESULTING FROM LAYOFF Transfers and<br/>reassignments, due to effects of layoff, shall be pursuant to Article 9 of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>28.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RE-EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS FOLLOWING LAYOFF The VCOE shall<br/>periodically mail to the FEDERATION a list of existing vacancies for unit members<br/>with a list of the names of those people filling vacancies, and copies of notices sent to<br/>laid off unit members.</p>

<p>28.4.2 The VCOE shall place returning unit members in comparable positions held at<br/>the time of layoff.</p>
<p>28.5 SUBSTITUTE SERVICE. If, in any school year, the laid-off unit member serves as<br/>a substitute in any position requiring certification for any twenty-one (21) days or<br/>more, within a period of sixty (60) school days, the compensation such unit member<br/>receives for substitute service in that sixty (60) day period, including unit member<br/>twenty (20) days of substitute service, shall not be less than the amount unit member<br/>would receive if unit member were being reappointed. The VCOE may not terminate<br/>such a unit member to avoid paying the regular rate of pay.</p>
<p>28.6 STATUTORY GUARANTEES. Nothing above shall preclude the VCOE's moving<br/>according to statutory time lines for layoff and shall satisfy the VCOE's obligation to<br/>bargain this topic during the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>28.7 SPECIALISTS AND CEC TEACHERS. In the event that there would be a reduction<br/>in the staffing levels for Specialists and/or CEC Teachers, who are nonpermanent<br/>employees (Neumarket v. Allard, 1985), not covered under EC 44955, the VCOE<br/>agrees to consult with the FEDERATION about the necessity and the process<br/>associated with the reduction.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>ARTICLE 29. DISCIPLINE SHORT OF DISMISSAL</p>
<p>29.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent has the right and responsibility to take disciplinary action where<br/>there are instances of unprofessional conduct, or refusal to obey the school laws of the<br/>State or reasonable regulations prescribed for the government of public schools by the<br/>State Board of Education, the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, or by the<br/>Superintendent, or by reasonable site level administrative rules, or by the requirements<br/>of the negotiated agreement. However, the FEDERATION and VCOE believe that<br/>the appropriate mechanism for the discipline of professionals is one that includes other<br/>professionals in the decisions. Toward that end, the FEDERATION and VCOE want<br/>a procedure that matches the conduct and the discipline, and involves unit members in<br/>the disciplinary process as outlined below. The FEDERATION recognizes its duty of<br/>fair representation to unit members, which may include at the complete discretion of<br/>the FEDERATION advice and counsel concerning the potential disciplinary action.<br/>The FEDERATION and VCOE agree not to influence the panel members outside of<br/>any hearing and to work cooperatively in the training of individual unit members<br/>appointed to the disciplinary panels.</p>
<p>29.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exercising this responsibility, VCOE agrees to progressively discipline, except<br/>where the severity of the offense requires otherwise. In all instances, the discipline<br/>applied must relate to the severity of the offense, be for just cause, and include the<br/>following due process procedure.</p>
<p>29.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive discipline shall include the following:</p>
<p>29.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1. A verbal warning from site and/or VCOE Administrators at a<br/>meeting where a FEDERATION representative may attend should the unit<br/>member so request. The site or VCOE administrator may have a witness to<br/>document the warning.</p>
<p>29.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2. Written warnings shall not be placed in the unit member's official<br/>personnel file or be subject to the hearing process contained below. Written<br/>warnings shall be signed by the unit member receiving them, preserved in a<br/>confidential file for no longer than two calendar years from the date of the<br/>incident, and attached to any subsequent discipline of the unit member for<br/>inclusion in the unit member's personnel file to be used for support of<br/>disciplinary actions. A unit member may attach a rebuttal to the written<br/>warning and have both the warning and the rebuttal placed in the personnel<br/>file should the unit member elect. It is not intended that this provision prevent<br/>the placement of material related to the evaluation process in the personnel<br/>file.</p>
<p>29.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3. A written reprimand may be issued for a severe or repeated<br/>infraction or violation. In that event, the unit member may respond in writing</p>
<p>and have that writing attached to the reprimand and placed in the personnel<br/>file.</p>
<p>29.3.4 Level 4. A unit member may be suspended without pay, for up to ten (10)<br/>days, or have other corrective disciplinary action(s) consistent and appropriate<br/>for the type and severity of the offense. The unit member is entitled to a<br/>hearing upon written request.</p>
<p>29.3.4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For suspensions greater than five days, the unit member shall<br/>be entitled, upon written request to the Director of Human<br/>Resources, a Skelly Hearing. A full Evidentiary Hearing is not<br/>required, but the unit member shall be provided a written<br/>notice of the proposed suspension, the specific reasons for the<br/>suspension, a copy of the materials in support of the<br/>suspension, and a right to respond either orally or in writing to<br/>the Hearing Officer. The Skelly Officer shall not be the person<br/>conducting the investigation or the direct supervisor of the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>29.3.4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Skelly Hearing if a unit member requests a full<br/>Evidentiary Hearing, a panel of three VCOE certificated unit<br/>members shall be appointed to review the evidence and<br/>determine whether discipline is appropriate. It shall be within<br/>the authority of the panel after having reviewed the evidence to<br/>recommend private or public reproval, to determine whether<br/>suspension is appropriate, or to shorten the length of the<br/>recommended suspension. One panel member shall be an<br/>administrator appointed from the list set out in 29.3.4.2 by<br/>VCOE. One panel member shall be a unit member appointed<br/>from the list set out in 29.3.4.2 by the FEDERATION. The<br/>third panel member shall be selected from a list of six names,<br/>three submitted by VCOE and three by the FEDERATION.<br/>The order of striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>29.3.4.2 All of the unit members shall be taken from a list of trained<br/>disciplinary panel members appointed bi-annually by VCFT.<br/>The training for panel members shall include but not be limited<br/>to rules of conduct for panel members, topics of importance<br/>such as ex parte contact, burden of proof, questioning strategy,<br/>credibility determinations, rules of evidence, and other<br/>concepts of elemental fairness. If this disciplinary procedure is<br/>required prior to the training, the selected employees shall be<br/>trained prior to the hearing.</p>

<p>Peer Assistance and Review Panel</p>
<p>Effective no later than July 1, 2000, a joint teacher/administrator PARP shall be established<br/>composed of three teachers appointed by the Federation and two administrators appointed by the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>It shall be the function of the PARP to select consulting teachers, review peer review reports<br/>prepared by consulting teachers, and make recommendations to the Superintendent regarding<br/>participants in the program, including forwarding to the Superintendent the names of<br/>individuals who after sustained assistance equivalent to the length of the program of<br/>improvement designed by the principal and the consulting teacher are not able to demonstrate<br/>satisfactory improvement. It shall be the responsibility of the PARP to assign a consulting<br/>teacher to a participating teacher based upon their collective judgment of who would be most<br/>suitable to provide assistance.</p>
<p>The PARP shall also annually evaluate the impact of YCSSO's PAR in order to improve the<br/>program. This evaluation may include but is not limited to interviews or surveys of program<br/>participants. The panel shall also submit recommendations for improvement of the program to<br/>the Superintendent and to the Federation.</p>
<p>The PARP shall meet and determine rules of operation consistent with the language of this<br/>Agreement, including but not limited to the development of forms to fulfill the monitoring<br/>requirements of Education Code Section 44500 (b) (6). Should either the Federation or<br/>YCSSO believe the rule(s) is not consistent with the terms of this agreement, the matter should<br/>be referred to Consultation to resolve. It is intended that PARP members shall be released for a<br/>portion of the meetings required to perform their duties, and compensated for duties to be<br/>performed above and beyond assigned hours. PARP members shall be allocated ten percent of<br/>the program funds for these purposes. PARP teachers shall be paid an amount that reasonably<br/>reflects their responsibility and time. Stipends for PARP Federation members and consulting<br/>teachers shall not be considered an administrative expense but direct services for the operation<br/>of the program. It is intended that no funds shall be expended which exceed the amount<br/>received for the purpose of implementing PAR.</p>
<p>Participating Teachers</p>
<p>A teacher participant in PAR shall be a permanent employee or teachers ineligible for a support<br/>program. Participants may either be volunteers or mandatory participants referred to the program<br/>as a result of an evaluation performed pursuant to subdivision<br/>(b) of Section 44664.</p>
<p>The PARP shall develop regulations for the volunteer participating teachers which will address<br/>entry and exit and support activities. Documentation shall be between the volunteer participating<br/>teacher and the consulting teacher except as required for PARP recordkeeping. The regulations<br/>developed by the PARP shall include the right of the referred participating teacher to present<br/>concerns to the PARP.</p>
<p>Selection Criteria and Operating Regulations for Consulting Teachers</p>
<p>A consulting teacher shall</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have five or more years of teaching experience;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have demonstrated exemplary teaching ability, as indicated by among other<br/>things, effective communication skills, subject matter and/or program knowledge,<br/>ability to work cooperatively and effectively with others, and mastery of a range<br/>of teaching strategies necessary to meet the needs of pupils in different contexts;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be a permanent teacher of VC S SO (or as waived for ROP with a clear credential);<br/>and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be appropriately credentialed.</p>
<p>Consulting teachers will be selected by the PARP through a three-step process of paper<br/>screening, interview, and classroom observation. Consulting teachers may be available to unit<br/>members and/or principals through the PARP, to provide assistance to teachers prior to their<br/>referral to PAR.</p>
<p>Consulting teachers shall serve at the pleasure of the PARP. Consulting teachers shall be paid an<br/>amount that reasonably reflects their responsibility and time.</p>
<p>Assistance and Review</p>
<p>Volunteer Teachers</p>
<p>A consulting teacher shall exercise professional discretion in what program of assistance is<br/>appropriate for volunteer teachers. The plan shall include staff development activities,<br/>demonstration teaching, and such other activities determined appropriate to assist the teacher's<br/>improvement.</p>
<p>Performance goals for participating teachers in the program shall be in writing, clearly stated,<br/>aligned with pupil learning and consistent with Section 44662. These goals shall be jointly<br/>developed cooperatively between the participating teacher and the consulting teacher.</p>
<p>Referred Teachers</p>
<p>The program shall expect and strongly encourage a cooperative relationship between the<br/>consulting teacher and the principal. Performance goals for participating teachers in the program<br/>shall be in writing, clearly stated, aligned with pupil learning and</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>consistent with Section 44662. These goals shall be jointly developed with the triad of the<br/>participating teacher, the consulting teacher and the principal.</p>
<p>The consulting teacher and the principal shall together prepare a plan for assisting a referred<br/>teacher to improve his or her teaching skills and knowledge. The plan shall include staff<br/>development activities, demonstration teaching, and such other activities determined appropriate to<br/>assist the teacher's improvement.</p>
<p>Assistance and review shall include no fewer than three observations of a referred participating<br/>teacher during periods of classroom instruction and one summative evaluation each semester a<br/>participating teacher remains in PAR.</p>
<p>The summative evaluations shall be shared with the PARP and the principal responsible for<br/>supervision of the referred teacher. A referred participating teacher may respond to any evaluation<br/>and have that response attached to the evaluation to be placed in the personnel file.</p>
<p>The assigned consulting teacher shall regularly consult with the principal responsible for<br/>supervision of the referred teacher; in the review phase of the process the consulting teacher<br/>shall be responsible for documenting the performance deficiencies of the participating teacher.</p>
<p>The consulting teacher shall be responsible for completion of observation reports and a journal of<br/>contacts with the participating teacher. The journal of contacts shall be shared with the PARP to<br/>assist them in determining the degree of assistance rendered the teacher. In the event that the<br/>participating teacher believes that there has been a procedural violation of the rules and<br/>regulations of the PARP, it shall be the responsibility of the Federation to review the<br/>participating teacher's concerns and make recommendations to the PARP.</p>
<p>Unit Determination and Hold Harmless</p>
<p>Consulting teachers and those teachers serving on the PARP shall not be considered management<br/>or supervisory based upon their participation in PAR. Teachers who provide assistance and<br/>review shall have the same protection from liability and access to appropriate defense as other<br/>public school employees pursuant to Division 3.6 (commencing with Section 810) of Title 1 of<br/>the Government Code. VCSSO shall hold these teachers and administrators harmless for<br/>actions occurring within the scope of their responsibility for participation in PAR. The<br/>decisions of the consulting teacher and the PARP which might lead to a decision by the<br/>Superintendent to bring dismissal actions are discretionary not ministerial and are not grievable.</p>
