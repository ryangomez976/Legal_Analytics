<p>ARTICLE I: AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Articles and provisions contained herein constitute a binding agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) by<br/>and between the Governing Board of the Bennett Valley Union School District (&quot;Board&quot;) and the<br/>Bennett Valley Teachers Association/CTA/NEA (&quot;Association&quot;), an employee organization.</p>

<p>ARTICLE III: GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose: A grievance procedure is a necessary, useful, and constructive means by which to<br/>clarify language in the Contract. Whenever possible, all grievances will be resolved informally<br/>or at the earliest possible stage of this grievance procedure. Both parties recognize that the<br/>procedure must be available without any fear of retribution because of its use.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions: A &quot;grievance&quot; is a dispute regarding an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or<br/>misapplication of the specific provisions of this Agreement, which is filed by a unit member who<br/>is directly affected by the alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the collective<br/>bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>A &quot;grievant&quot; is a member directly affected by an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or<br/>misapplication of this Agreement, or is the Association in matters concerning Recognition (1),<br/>Association Rights (2), Grievance Procedure (3), or those that involve an individual, or a group<br/>or class of teachers. Any article of the contract can be grieved subject to this grievance<br/>procedure except as noted in Article VI Leaves and Absences, 6.1: Leaves “With<br/>Compensation” is not subject to the Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>A &quot;day&quot; is any day that the district administrative office of Bennett Valley Union School District<br/>is open for business except for winter and spring recesses.</p>

<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Level</p>
<p>3.3.1 Before filing a grievance and within thirty (30) days from the occurrence of the act or<br/>omission which gave rise to the grievance, or within thirty (30) days from the date the<br/>grievant knew or should reasonably have known of the act or omission, the employee and<br/>immediate supervisor shall attempt to resolve the problem by an informal conference. If<br/>agreeable to both parties, the superintendent may participate in the initial informal<br/>conference, and/or an additional conference with either party at the informal level. At the<br/>informal conference the employee shall inform his/her immediate supervisor of his/her<br/>intent to file a grievance.</p>
<p>3. 3.2 Before filing an Association grievance, the Association shall attempt to resolve the</p>
<p>problem by an informal conference with the Superintendent within fifteen (15) days of<br/>the alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this Agreement, or within<br/>fifteen (15) days of when knowledge of such problem was possible.</p>

<p>terms of this Agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations, and<br/>procedures of the District.</p>

<p>of the arbitrator so selected and the opinions the arbitrator expresses will<br/>be confined exclusively to the interpretation of the expressed provision or<br/>provisions of this agreement at issue between the parties.

<p>any right to statutory remedies or to the exercise of any legal process other<br/>than as provided by this grievance/arbitration procedure. The processing<br/>of a grievance beyond Level III shall constitute an express election on the<br/>part of the grievant that the grievance/arbitration procedure is the chosen<br/>forum for resolving the issues contained in the grievance, and that the<br/>grievant shall not resort to any other forum or procedure for resolution or<br/>review of the issues.</p>
<p>3.4.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitrator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in grievances shall be binding on all parties</p>

A certificated employee employed for<br/>less than five (5) school days a week shall be entitled, for a school year of service, to that<br/>proportion of ten (10) days leave of absence for illness or injury as the number of days he<br/>is employed per week bears to five and is entitled to such additional days in addition<br/>thereto as the governing board may allow for illness or injury to certificated employees<br/>employed for less than five (5) school days per week. Pay for any day of such absence<br/>shall be the same as the pay that would have been received had the employee served<br/>during the day. Credit for leave of absence need not be accrued prior to taking such leave<br/>by the employee and such leave of absence may be taken at any time during the school<br/>year.

The five (5) months or less period during which the above deductions<br/>occur shall not begin until the teacher has exhausted all available sick leave, including all<br/>accumulated sick leave and any other available paid leave. If the teacher continues to be<br/>absent beyond the additional five (5) school month period of differential pay, the<br/>employee shall be placed on a reemployment list for 24 months if probationary and 39<br/>months if permanent.

<p>6.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining Maternity Leave and Sick Leave for Maternity Purposes</p>
<p>Nothing in Parts 1 or 2 above shall prevent an employee from combining maternity leave<br/>and sick leave for maternity purposes for the same pregnancy. The employee shall<br/>designate, prior to the first day of either type of leave, which days of absence shall be<br/>taken as maternity leave and the doctor’s verification shall designate which days shall be<br/>taken as sick leave.</p>

For example, if a teacher has begun work on<br/>site at 7:30 AM, he/she can leave at 3:00 UNLESS something is scheduled. Teachers should<br/>make an effort not to make non-emergency appointments off-site until after 3:30.</p>

Teachers will be notified and given an agenda one week in advance of<br/>faculty meetings, and minutes of the decisions made at the meetings within one week<br/>following the meeting. Optional meetings may also be scheduled, but attendance is<br/>voluntary. Optional meetings may be used for subcommittee and ad hoc committee<br/>work, offering a forum for teachers interested in a particular issue or topic an opportunity<br/>to work out a proposal for the rest of the faculty to consider at a regular faculty meeting.</p>

<p>CLASS PLACEMENT</p>
<p>Bennett Valley Union ESD<br/>Board Policy 5114</p>
<p>The placement process is one of considerable work and thought by teachers and principals. Those involved in the<br/>process are aware of the many variables that influence a child’s success in school. At no time does one single<br/>item determine class placement. A gathering of information by the current teacher is the primary source for class<br/>placement decisions. Our mission in class placement is to best meet the needs of each individual child. It is<br/>desired that each child will belong to a well-balanced, teachable group. Class placement will help to ensure<br/>optimum growth for each child intellectually, emotionally, physically, and socially.</p>

<p>BENNETT VALLEY UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>Santa Rosa, California</p>
<p>Bennett Valley Union ESD<br/>Administrative Regulation 5114</p>
<p>Our mission in class placement is to best meet the needs of each individual child. It is our intent that each child<br/>will belong to a well-balanced, teachable group. Class placement will help to ensure optimum growth for each<br/>child intellectually, emotionally, and socially. In order to accomplish this, information will be collected on each<br/>child. Multiple measures of academic progress including student performance on district assessments, teacher<br/>designed assessments, standardized test scores, and special needs are sources of information considered in<br/>balancing classes</p>
<p>Parent/Guardian Input</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians are partners in the educational process and will be offered the opportunity to provide input that<br/>will be considered as part of the placement process. The child’s teacher knows the child in the academic setting<br/>and will be present at placement meetings to help ensure a positive class assignment for the following year.<br/>Keeping in mind that it is difficult, if not impossible, to honor all requests and maintain well-balanced classes,<br/>parents/guardians who wish to offer additional information or specific attributes of their child that the teacher may<br/>not know, may complete a form available in the school offices. For those parents/guardians who wish to request<br/>particular teachers, three or more teacher’s names must be circled (without ranking) on the fall line up of teachers<br/>list on the back of the form. This will help the placement team understand the parents/guardians concerns and<br/>requests. Again, it is difficult to honor all requests for specific teachers and maintain well-balanced classes.<br/>Providing several options increases the likelihood that we can create well-balanced classes for all children.<br/>Without at least three teachers names circled, placement teams will be unable to consider the request.<br/>Parents/Guardians who would like to request that their child not be considered for a combination class or job<br/>share when one is scheduled to exist for the next grade should so indicate on the form.</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians must place completed forms in the school office in the appropriate grade level box between the<br/>dates designated annually. No forms will be accepted after the designated date. The principal and the placement<br/>teams (teachers) will consider only the forms filled out correctly and received by the designated date when<br/>placing students.</p>
<p>Page - 77</p>
<p>In order to be fair, offering the same opportunity to all parents/guardians, other than the aforementioned letters, no<br/>conversations, e-mail, voice mail, or personal letters regarding the placement of students with administrators or<br/>teachers will be considered. Since they must be used on appeal, the Superintendent and Governing Board will not<br/>be involved in the placement of students and will not influence placement decisions except as noted in the &quot;appeal<br/>process&quot; below.</p>
<p>Teacher Input</p>
<p>The classroom teacher has a wealth of information on each of his/her students and is a critical part of the<br/>placement process. Teachers will complete a card on each child in their class indicating such attributes as the<br/>child's academic performance (whether the child is achieving below, at, or above grade level on district standards,<br/>whether the child presents significant behavioral issues), any special needs the child may have, learning style,<br/>program participation, and any comments that would assist in placing the child (such as positive and unfortunate<br/>student combinations, etc.) Special education teachers collaborate with the site administrator to request specific<br/>placements prior to class placement meetings. The cards will be utilized by the principal and placement teams for<br/>making class placements. Receiving teachers may make placement requests based on familiarity with the family,<br/>experience with the child in various school activities, etc.</p>
<p>The Process</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers will complete placement cards for each student by the first Friday in May. Teachers may add</p>
<p>additional information (such as DIBELS scores) once cards are returned to the teams for placement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may complete teacher request forms during the parent request window. Forms are due by 4pm on</p>
<p>the day after Open House.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school principal will collect the placement cards, the parent/guardian request forms, and teacher</p>
<p>request forms.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal and special needs programs specialists will meet before school dismisses to make special</p>
<p>education and EL clusters of no more than 3 students per class.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the class placement meetings, principals will make administrative placements for students with<br/>significant behavioral/emotional needs.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teams will meet before the end of the school year to create preliminary class lists following the Class</p>
<p>Placement Directions (included in the appendix). They will receive the lists with the Special Ed., EL<br/>clusters and administrative placements. They will receive the placement cards coded with parent and<br/>teacher requests to complete placements for the remaining students. (Other arrangements may be made<br/>for Kindergarten placements.)</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending teams will meet to review preliminary class lists before school starts. Any changes due to students</p>
<p>leaving or entering the district over the summer will be made as needed. Assignment of special needs<br/>students must be equitable across the grade level.</p>
<p>No Guarantees</p>
<p>Due to possible changes of grade level, new teachers hired during the summer, enrollment fluctuations, the<br/>impossibility of fdling all requests, and our desire for the best placement for all children, we cannot guarantee that<br/>parent/guardian requests will be honored.</p>
<p>Posting</p>
<p>Since the lists will not be finalized until the teachers return, the lists will normally be posted at 4:00 pm in the<br/>school offices the Friday (if school begins on a Monday or Tuesday) or the Monday (if school begins on a<br/>Wednesday) before school begins. Once the lists are posted, the lists and the assigned class placements will be<br/>considered final.</p>
<p>New students</p>
<p>Students who are registered before the day the lists are posted will be placed on class lists. Students who register<br/>on or after the first day of school will not be able to be placed in a class until the day after their registration is<br/>complete so that an accurate count and balance of the students in each class can be made prior to making the</p>
<p>Page - 78</p>
<p>placement for a new student. Teachers will be verbally notified by noon of the day before a student is to start.</p>
<p>Placement of all students will be based upon maintaining balanced classes. Balance issues that will be considered<br/>in the placement of all students include the total number of students in each class, the number of boys and girls,<br/>special program participation (EL, Special Education, Gifted and Talented Education, Title 1), the number of<br/>children achieving below, at, and above grade level on district standards, the number of children who present<br/>significant behavioral issues, and students with any other special needs. The placement of new students will made<br/>by the principal after consultation with affected teachers (e.g. the teacher(s) at the grade level with the fewest<br/>students, a teacher where the class composition may result in a better, more balanced class placement for the<br/>child, etc.)</p>
<p>Requests for Changes of Placement</p>
<p>Requests for changes of placement are not encouraged. Placement changes are always a disruption for the class,<br/>teacher, and student involved. A request for a change of placement is considered as carefully as the initial<br/>placement to make sure it is truly in the best interest of all students. The policy requires that parents/guardians go<br/>through specific steps and complete certain forms. The timing of these steps is to support parents/guardians and<br/>students in giving the assigned class a fair chance and to get acquainted with the assigned teacher.</p>
<p>Requesting a change out of the assigned class does not guarantee a particular replacement teacher, nor does it save<br/>a &quot;spot&quot; in a class in anticipation of a possible change. If the principal decides to make the change and remove<br/>the child from the assigned class, the principal will use the same criteria to determine the new class placement (to<br/>maintain the equitable class balance) as in the original placement process.</p>
<p>The protocol for requesting a change of placement is to be followed in this order:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent/guardian shall approach the class placement with an open mind, shall give the child a chance in<br/>the class for at least 2 weeks, and shall communicate any concerns with the assigned teacher.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent/guardian shall attend the entire Back to School Night presentation in your child’s classroom.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent/guardian must meet, in person, with the teacher and principal to discuss unresolved concerns<br/>and reasons for continuing to want a change of placement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall have 5 school days to render a final decision on the placement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for a second change of placement during the same school year will not be considered.</p>
<p>Appeal Process</p>
<p>If dissatisfied with the principal’s decision, parents/guardians may appeal the principal’s decision to the<br/>Superintendent, and, if necessary, the Superintendent’s decision to the Board. The Superintendent shall have up<br/>to 10 school days from the appeal meeting to finalize a decision. If a Board appeal is necessary, the appeal shall<br/>be heard and acted upon at the next regularly scheduled board meeting. Because they are a part of the appeal<br/>process, the Superintendent and the Board should not be involved unless and until an appeal is made.</p>
<p>Once adopted, the Board of Trustees agrees to consult with the official representative of the teachers (BVTA<br/>President) before making any changes to this policy.</p>

Our mission in class placement is to ensure that<br/>each child will belong to a well-balanced, teachable group. Class placement will help to ensure<br/>optimum growth for each child intellectually, emotionally, physically, and socially.</p>
<p>Parent/Guardian Input</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians are partners in the educational process and will be offered the opportunity to provide<br/>input that will be considered as part of the placement process. The child’s teacher knows the child in the<br/>academic setting and will be present at placement meetings to help ensure a positive class assignment<br/>for the following year. Keeping in mind that it is difficult, if not impossible, to honor all requests and<br/>maintain well-balanced classes, parents/guardians who wish to offer additional information or specific<br/>attributes of their child that the teacher may not know, must complete this form and circle three or more<br/>names of teachers (without ranking) that they feel would be suitable for their child found on the back of<br/>this form. It is difficult to honor all requests for specific teachers and maintain well-balance classes.<br/>Providing several options increases the likelihood that we can create well-balanced classes for all<br/>children. Without at least three teachers’ names circled, placement teams will be unable to consider the<br/>request for specific teachers.</p>
<p>Please place this form in the appropriate grade level box in the school office during the designated time<br/>frame by 4:00 p.m. (Dates changed annually) No forms will be accepted after the deadline. The<br/>principal and the placement teams (teachers) will consider only the information on the forms received by<br/>the deadline when placing students.</p>
<p>No conversations, e-mail, voice mail, or personal letters regarding the placement of students with<br/>administrators, teachers, trustees, or other parents/guardians will be considered. Since they must be used<br/>on appeal, the Superintendent and Governing Board will not be involved in the placement of students<br/>and will not influence placement decisions except, as needed, on appeal.</p>
<p>Fall Line up of Teachers</p>
<p>Please circle three or more teachers.</p>
<p>(Teachers will be listed here by grade level. The forms will be color coded by grade level.)</p>

<p>Class Placement Directions: K - 2<sup>nd</sup></p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to filling out pink and blue cards, EL personnel needs to get CELDT levels of each student<br/>to their administrator. Special Ed needs to get special ed student time and subject matter to<br/>Administrator.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers need to get a list of #4 behaviors from their class to the administrator.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers to fill out pink and blue cards, giving administrator the cards for the first pass,<br/>including RSP/SDC, EL, and #4 behaviors. The rest get bundled and given to the office<br/>manager.</p>
<p>Fill out the grid as vou complete the steps, ensuring that there is balance between classes after<br/>each-Slegi</p>
<p>STEP 1: First Pass by Administrator</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Placements/Special Ed placements/EL placements and severe behavior</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher Requests</p>
<p>**Teachers review first pass to see if there are any concerns with these placements. Spec. Ed<br/>clusters, EL clusters, and red behavior placements may be moved, if needed for balanced classes,<br/>after consulting with administration.</p>
<p>STEP 2: Behavior (**Try to balance for academics as you place for behavior)</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place 3’s with parent requests; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place 3’s without parent requests; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place 2’s with parent requests; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place 2’s without parent requests; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place l’s with parent requests; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place l’s without parent requests; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>STEP 3: Time (student or parent requires more of teacher's time than average)</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/Student Time - with parent request</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent/Student Time - no parent request</p>
<p>STEP 4: Adjust Academic as Needed (**Try to balance for number of boys/girls in this step.)</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Academic - with parent request; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Academic - no parent request; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Academic - with parent request; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Academic - no parent request; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow Academic - with parent request; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow Academic - no parent request; watch for unfortunate combinations</p>
<p>STEP 5: Compare Special Needs (adjust as needed to make classes fair and balanced)</p>
<p>Things to consider:</p>
<p>IEP and 504 meetings<br/>SDC out of class most of day</p>

<p>APPENDIX 11<br/>Maternity Protocol: Certificated</p>
<p>Maternity leaves are strictly governed by law and contract. The board will approve maternity leave per<br/>the terms of the BVTA contract (starting on page 20).</p>
<p>Maternity leave is a provision that guarantees an employee a job following leave. It is an unpaid leave<br/>except under certain provisions as described below.</p>
<p>Under the law, pregnancy is not classified as an illness for which sick leave can be taken. (Please see<br/>page 20 sections f and g). If one is sick because of the pregnancy (on bed rest, etc) then a doctor's note<br/>verifying that is used to allow the use of sick leave for the doctor specified length of the illness (or bed<br/>rest).</p>
<p>On page 21 of the contract, there is a section regarding combining maternity and sick leave—maternity<br/>leave is unpaid (page 20 l.f) Sick leave can be used with maternity if the doctor specifies that one is sick<br/>as a condition of the pregnancy (provisions a and b on the top of page 21)</p>
<p>Sick leave can be used for recovery from childbirth when the doctor so indicates in a signed note (with<br/>specified recovery dates) AND when the employee will be returning to work following the recovery.<br/>Doctors routinely grant up to 4 weeks before and up to 6 weeks following birth as needed for this. So<br/>with a doctor's note, sick leave can be used during this time.</p>
<p>Other than that, one can combine a few things to get paid for some of the days:</p>
<p>•Personal leave (out of sick leave) for up to 5 days per year for any purpose. (Page 17 1.1.4)<br/>•Days of convenience (Page 17 1.1.5) or wellness days (page 16 1.1.1.2) accrued<br/>• 1.1.1.2 allows one to use wellness days (up to 2).</p>
<p>The family medical leave act allows one to get 12 weeks of unpaid leave AND 12 weeks of benefits<br/>while out, at district expense, (page 23 3.3). For the rest of the time, the employee may purchase district<br/>benefits at the district cost.</p>
<p>Page 17 in the contract 1.1.3 Personal Necessity: One can take a total of 10 days (out of sick leave) to<br/>care for the newborn baby, allowable under provision 1—illness of an immediate family member.<br/>Although newborns are not technically ill, they are as vulnerable as a seriously ill person for the first 10<br/>days of life.</p>
<p>Family medical leave act gives 12 weeks of health benefits.</p>

<p>Bennett Valley Union ESD<br/>Administrative Regulation</p>
<p>AR4124</p>
<p>Personnel</p>
<p>Shared Teaching Contracts</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>Job sharing shall refer to two existing district certificated employees sharing one full-time position for a specified<br/>period of time and taking an unpaid leave for that portion of their regular teaching position that each is not<br/>working while job sharing. Teachers interested in job sharing are encouraged to demonstrate in their application<br/>the potential benefit to children who will benefit from the talents of two highly qualified teachers, who through<br/>their collaboration in curricular planning and meeting students needs, provide an exceptional learning experience<br/>for all children. To be approved, a shared teaching contract must appear to be in the best interest of the students.<br/>The decision to approve or disapprove a job sharing application is discretionary and shall not be subject to the<br/>grievance procedure. A unit member who has been approved for a job share will be granted a leave of absence for<br/>the part of the assignment he/she is not working.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All current district certificated employees are eligible to apply for job shares.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing contracts shall be one (1) year in length. Unit members must resubmit a request to job share for<br/>another school year, if desired. Proposals should indicate if members are interested in multi-year job shares,<br/>however each proposal must be re-approved each year. Contracts with employees in job share positions shall<br/>clearly indicate that teachers shall honor their job share contract and will not be eligible for other positions in the<br/>District during the term of their job share contract.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one of the job share partners shall be tenured. The other must be on staff but can be tenured,<br/>probationary, or temporary. There may be extenuating circumstances that create a necessity to hire an outside<br/>candidate. But these will be rare exceptions. Employees hired for job share temporary vacancies created by a<br/>permanent employee's desire to work less than a full contract during the subsequent year by entering into a &quot;job<br/>share&quot; are classified as &quot;temporary&quot;. The permanent employee is effectively &quot;on leave&quot; for the portion of the<br/>position that will be shared. The permanent employee retains rights to that portion of their position following the<br/>job share.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The job share request will specify the benefits to the District and the students as well as the benefits to the unit<br/>members involved. The written request will indicate the names of the unit members who are proposing to job<br/>share and it will indicate how the unit members plan to implement the job share position. The request must show<br/>details of how the unit members intend to coordinate their work, insuring that the educational continuity of the<br/>class will be preserved. The proposal should include a plan for the dissolution of the job share. Applicants will<br/>use the application provided by the district.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persons sharing the contract shall agree to the district regulations.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing contracts shall reflect a team of two unit members who have jointly agreed to apply. Those who<br/>would like to job share shall complete the district application and submit it per the timeline. Each application will<br/>be weighed solely on its own merits.</p>
<p>7. Requests to participate in a job share shall be submitted by February 15 of the school year prior to the intended<br/>job share. The District exclusively reserves the right of approval. The District may, after February<sup>7</sup> 15th, at its<br/>sole discretion, accept late job share proposals that are judged to be in the best interest of the pupils and programs</p>
<p>Page - 105</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal of the school and the superintendent recommend to the Board approval or disapproval of the<br/>job share proposal. Approval of a job share proposal shall be determined by an assessment of the proposal,<br/>meeting the needs of the students and the school involved, as well as those of the unit members. Approval of a<br/>job share request shall also be determined by the District's ability to obtain a suitable replacement for the vacancy<br/>created by the job share, should it be necessary to fill said vacancy. Approval of the application is considered by<br/>the school Board at the regular Board meeting following district receipt of job share application.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial costs to the district as a result of the shared contract shall be carefully considered.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharers will be given a prorated portion of their salary, health and welfare, retirement, and sick leave<br/>benefits commensurate with their regular full-time salary. Employees may also participate in health benefits<br/>beyond their prorated share at their own expense.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee must work 75% or more of the teaching days of the school year to be deemed a complete<br/>school year for advancement to tenured status, seniority purposes, to count toward ten years to qualify for early<br/>retirement benefits, etc.</p>

There<br/>will be no additional compensation for the job share partners to attend the aforementioned days/activities. Each<br/>job share partner shall participate in staff and team meetings in the percentage they work. Both partners are<br/>encouraged to be present for special events. (Halloween Parade at Yulupa, etc.)</p>

<p>Shared Teaching Assignments</p>
<p>The Governing Board realizes that for personal reasons, a certificated teacher sometimes may prefer to<br/>share the responsibility, salary and benefits of a full-time teaching position with one of his/her fellow<br/>teachers. When those sharing a position have compatible work patterns and similar goals, this situation<br/>can benefit teachers and students alike. By accommodating requests for shared teaching assignments, the<br/>district is more likely to retain teachers of outstanding capabilities.</p>
<p>Sharing contracts is available and may be approved by application process as a benefit to employees,<br/>when it also benefits students. Some of the increased costs incurred from a shared teaching situation<br/>may be in statutory benefits, processing payroll, processing absences, conducting evaluations, and in<br/>certain circumstances, compensation for a teacher to come in on a day when he/she does not normally<br/>work. To the extent possible, the district should not incur additional costs due to two employees wishing<br/>to job share. District policy and contract language encourage job share partners to substitute for each<br/>other whenever possible to minimize academic disruption to students. Subbing is compensated at the<br/>current &quot;sub rate&quot; or by the partners trading days. Each job share partner will receive a prorated share of<br/>salary, sick leave, personal leave days, and personal necessity days, based on percentage of full-time<br/>equivalent (FTE). Job share partners working at least .5 FTE will receive a prorated share of &quot;wellness&quot;<br/>days and days of convenience. To avoid a compromise in the consistency of instruction to students, job<br/>share applications must be considered carefully. Following approval by the principal and<br/>Superintendent, job share agreements must be approved by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>There shall be no more than the equivalent of 1 job share per grade level at each school site (4 at<br/>Yulupa; 3 at Strawberry) with a maximum of 2 in any one grade level.</p>

<p>Appendix 13: Class Budgets</p>
<p>Class budgets are as follows:</p>
<p>Yulupa: $525<br/>Strawberry: $650<br/>Special Ed: $500</p>
<p>Speech: $150 (does not include test protocols)</p>
<p>New to the district or new to a grade level: an extra $125</p>
<p>Process</p>
<p>Please try to use the designated SCOE group vendor contract for your orders. That is the easiest process<br/>for inventory and for the auditors for internal controls. The auditors would like us to discourage store<br/>purchases and reimbursements. However, we have outlined with auditors certain conditions under<br/>which we will still be allowed to reimburse you for purchases made outside of the order process.</p>
<p>The auditors will allow us to reimburse you only for things you order or buy outside of the School<br/>Specialties and SCOE group contract when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>1) For Items Purchased outside of the School Specialties or SCOE group supply contract (such as sale<br/>items at Target—but ordering on-line instead of making a store purchase is preferred whenever feasible.)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You pay for something personally</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring in the receipt and the itemts) so it can be signed off and be entered into inventory.</p>
<p>If the item is large or awkward, the site principal can verify the item and sign off on the reimbursement<br/>form.</p>
<p>C . You will be reimbursed as long as the total of your School Specialties, SCOE group order, and<br/>personally paid/ordered items does not exceed your budget.</p>
<p>2) For Items ORDERED outside of the School Specialties or SCOE group supply contract (items<br/>ordered online, etc.)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You order and pay for the item personally</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the item shipped to the District Office—We are NOT allowed to reimburse you for<br/>any order delivered to your home (or to anywhere other than the DO)</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bring in the receipt emailed to you in order when you pick up your item. Many times,<br/>items shipped from on-line orders do not have all of the purchase information—the receipt in the box<br/>may only state the item and not the price—we need to be able to verify what items were received and<br/>how much they cost and the administrative assistant/accounts payable person needs to enter them into<br/>inventory.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be reimbursed as long as the total of your School Specialties, SCOE group order, and<br/>personally ordered/paid items does not exceed your budget.</p>
<p>Again, district auditors require reimbursable items be delivered ONLY to the District Office (so they can<br/>be entered into inventory), and NOT to your residence. Obviously, the more you can use the School<br/>Specialty and SCOE order, the easier it is on Administrative Assistant for inventory and audit.</p>
