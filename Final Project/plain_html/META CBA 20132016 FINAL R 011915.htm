<p>6.1 Any grievance which may arise between an employee or the association and the<br/>District with respect to the interpretation or application of any of the terms of this Agreement,<br/>except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be determined by the provisions of this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step One: The initial step in the adjustment of a grievance shall be a discussion<br/>between the Grievant or the Grievant’s representative and the District Superintendent who will<br/>answer within ten (10) days. This step shall be started within thirty (30) days of the date of the<br/>action complained of, or the date the Grievant became aware of the incident which is the basis<br/>for the grievance.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Two: If a grievance is not resolved in the first step, the second step shall be<br/>the presentation of the grievance in writing by either the Grievant or the Grievant’s<br/>representative to the District Superintendent, who shall answer in writing within ten (10) days.<br/>The second step shall be taken within ten (10) days of the date of the answer in Step One. The<br/>written presentation shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the circumstances<br/>involved, the pertinent dates, the decision rendered at the previous step, the section of the</p>
<p>Agreement alleged to be violated and the specified remedy sought.</p>
<p>6.4 Step Three: If a grievance is not resolved in the second step, the third step shall<br/>be referral by the Association to mediation within ten (10) days of the answer in Step Two.<br/>Whenever a grievance is referred to mediation, either party shall request that the California State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service refer a State Mediator. The State Mediator shall assist the<br/>parties in the resolution of the grievance in the same manner as that which is normally used in<br/>the mediation of interest disputes. Referral to Step Four shall not occur until the Mediator has<br/>released the parties from the mediation process.</p>
<p>6.5(a) Step Four: If a grievance is not resolved in the third step, the fourth step shall be<br/>referral by the Association to arbitration. The fourth step shall be taken within twenty (20) days<br/>of the conclusion of the mediation process.</p>
<p>6.5(b) An Arbitrator shall be appointed on each occasion that a grievance is submitted to<br/>arbitration. In the event that the District and the Association are unable to agree to the selection<br/>of an Arbitrator, they shall request the State of California Mediation and Conciliation Service to<br/>nominate five (5) persons to be the Arbitrator. The District and the Association each will<br/>alternately challenge two (2) of such nominees, the party having the first challenged to be<br/>determined by lot. The remaining nominee shall be accepted as the Arbitrator, whose<br/>compensation and expenses shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. The<br/>District and the Association shall pay the compensation and expenses of their respective<br/>appointees and witnesses. Expense items which are requested by the Arbitrator or by both<br/>parties, such as court reporters, transcripts, or room rent, shall be borne equally by the parties.<br/>Other expense items which are requested by only one party shall be paid for by that party.</p>
<p>6.5(c) The Arbitrator shall hold such hearings and shall consider such evidence, which<br/>to the Arbitrator appears necessary and proper. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and<br/>binding on the District, the Association, and the Grievant, and shall not add to, disregard or<br/>modify any of the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the Grievant or the Association to meet any of the aforementioned time<br/>limits will result in forfeiture of the grievance. Failure by the District to meet any of the<br/>aforementioned time limits will allow the grievance to advance to the next step. Except,<br/>however, that the aforementioned time limits may be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may present grievances in accordance with this Article without the<br/>intervention of the Association, so long as the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and is<br/>not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and further provided that the<br/>District shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy<br/>of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a<br/>response.</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Grievant shall in no way interfere with the right of the District to proceed in<br/>cariying out is management responsibilities subject to a final decision on the grievance. In the<br/>event the grievance involved a legal order, requirement or other directive, the Grievant shall</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>fulfill or carry out such order, requirements or directive, pending the final decision of the<br/>grievance.</p>

<p>15.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee fails to return immediately to the expiration of a leave of absence,<br/>or if the employee accepts other full-time employment while on a leave of absence, the employee<br/>will thereby forfeit the leave of absence and terminate employment with the District.</p>

<p>Employee Evaluations and Personnel Files</p>
<p>The primary purpose of evaluation is to facilitate the professional growth or effectiveness of<br/>certificated employees in order to enhance teaching and student learning. This is best<br/>accomplished when the evaluation is a continuing, professional process that provides regular<br/>feedback between the certificated employee and evaluator. The fundamental premise for a<br/>successful evaluation is the necessity of mutual respect and confidence between evaluators<br/>and the employees being evaluated.</p>
<p>The District retains the responsibility for evaluation and assessment of the performance of<br/>all certificated employees, subject to the provision of this Article. The evaluators are<br/>expected to follow evaluation procedures and orderly methods of identifying strengths and<br/>deficiencies based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP)<br/>described in Attachment 3,Form A and shall maintain accurate and impartial objective<br/>records as set forth in the evaluation procedures. No grievances arising under this article<br/>may be filed with the respect to the substance, rating, or conclusions in the evaluation. The<br/>certificated employee may only file a grievance on an allegation that the evaluation<br/>procedures were violated. Overall evaluation activities shall be performed by the principal<br/>and when so requested the District Superintendent.</p>
<p>19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated employees shall be evaluated using the Clinical Supervision Model.</p>
<p>Types of supervision include:</p>
<p>19.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full lesson observation consists of: (a) pre lesson conference between the<br/>certificated employee and evaluator, (b) a full length observation of a minimum of 30<br/>minutes, (c) an analysis of the lesson, and (d) a post lesson observation conference with<br/>the evaluator.</p>
<p>19.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A walk through observation shall consist of: (a) unannounced observation, (b)<br/>analysis of the lesson, and (c) a post lesson observation conference with the evaluator.</p>
<p>The content of the post lesson observation conference for either a full lesson observation<br/>or a walk through observation shall be reduced to a written summary provided to the<br/>certificated employee noting strengths, deficiencies, recommendations and/or corrective<br/>actions if any. The certificated employee shall take affirmative action to correct any and<br/>all deficiencies.</p>
<p>19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation procedures shall address the assessment of certificated employees’<br/>competences as it relates to the following criteria:</p>
<p>19.2.1 The establishment by the teacher of reasonable educational goals in</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>the cognitive and/or affective domains as it relates to CSTP.</p>
<p>19.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of students toward the standards established of expected<br/>student achievement at each grade level in each area of study.</p>

<p>19.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee's adherence to curricular objectives.</p>

<p>19.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full lesson observations and walk through observations of the work performance<br/>of a certificated employee shall be conducted openly and with full knowledge of the<br/>teacher. Certificated employees shall be given a copy of any evaluation report and the<br/>evaluator shall discuss such report with the certificated employee.</p>
<p>19.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary certificated employees shall be evaluated at least once per school<br/>year.

<p>19.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever appropriate, the evaluator shall make specific recommendations for<br/>improvement and give assistance in implementing such recommendations which may<br/>include adequate release time for the employee to visit and observe similar classes in<br/>other schools.</p>
<p>19.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee shall be held responsible for any aspect of the educational program<br/>over which the employee has no authority or ability to correct the deficiencies. Non-<br/>administrative employees shall not be required to participate in the evaluation or<br/>observation of other employees, nor shall they be required to assess their own<br/>performance.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 28</p>
<p>INTERIM PROCEDURES</p>
<p>PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW</p>
<p>Underlying Assumptions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the PAR Program is assistance not evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the Consulting Teacher and the Joint Panel is to provide assistance,<br/>not to evaluate teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It continues to be the District's responsibility and authority to evaluate teachers.<br/>The PAR Program does not provide for a &quot;second opinion&quot; in teacher evaluations.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Panel will establish the annual budget for PAR subject to the provisions<br/>of the collective bargaining agreement. The Joint Panel will determine the<br/>expenditure of all the money received for the PAR program subject to the<br/>provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. The District will allocate to<br/>the PAR budget the entire amount of money it receives for PAR which is<br/>estimated to be the amount of money the district receives for mentor teacher<br/>funding plus $2,800.00 for the 2000-2001 school year, except the District shall<br/>reserve 5% thereof for administrative costs. Income from the State of California<br/>for PAR does not include income for instructional time and staff development<br/>reform programs, school development plans or the mega item block grant.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Panel ensures the process is followed. It does not judge, evaluate, or</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>render decisions on individual cases.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priority for the PAR Program is first for referred classroom teachers with an<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation and second for voluntary classroom teachers.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time for the Consulting Teacher and compensation for services of the<br/>Consulting Teacher outside of the regular work day will be provided based upon<br/>budget guidelines established by the panel.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence for participating in the PAR Program should have as little impact as<br/>possible on the classroom. Only the consulting teacher or Referred Participating<br/>Teacher will be absent from the classroom based upon the needs as determined by<br/>the panel. Such absences from the classroom will be limited.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for PAR shall include all costs thereof including substitutes, costs of<br/>absence from the classroom for the consulting teacher and Referred Participating<br/>Teacher, stipends for panel members, and training and any other activities as<br/>determined by the panel. The PAR Program shall continue to exist so long as the<br/>State of California continues to apportion funding to implement the program and<br/>the District actually receives such funding. In no event shall the District expend<br/>any funds beyond those funds actually received from the State of California for<br/>the implementation of the PAR Program which, as noted above, is estimated to be<br/>approximately the amount of money the district receives for mentor teacher<br/>funding plus $2,800.00 for the 2000-2001 school year including 5% thereof for<br/>administrative costs.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains the responsibility for conducting “Stull Act” (Education Code<br/>§44660) evaluations of unit members. These procedures do not incorporate by<br/>reference, restate, modify, abridge, or waive the rights of unit members under<br/>Education Code §44660 et seq.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Program is not subject to a grievance procedure inasmuch as majority of<br/>the members on the panel are unit members.</p>
