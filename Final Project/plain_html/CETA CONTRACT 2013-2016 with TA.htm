<p>In the event that a unit member does not become a member of the<br/>Association or does not pay a service fee directly to the Association, the<br/>District shall begin automatic payroll deduction in the same manner as set<br/>forth in Section 4.4.2 of this Agreement and pursuant to the Government<br/>Code.</p></td></tr>

<p>Prior to beginning automatic payroll deduction, the Association will<br/>certify to the District in writing that:</p>

<p>The written certification of 4.4.3.3 above shall be a condition precedent to<br/>the District’s collection of the service fee.</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is in a non-pay status for an entire pay period,<br/>no withholding will be made to cover the pay period. In the case<br/>of a unit member who is in a non-pay status during only part of the<br/>pay period, and the salary is not sufficient to cover the full<br/>withholding, no deduction shall be made.

Under no circumstances shall the District be<br/>required to dismiss or otherwise discipline any unit member for failure to fulfill their<br/>obligations to pay the fees established in this Article.</p>

<p>claim, demand, suit or action for which the District seeks<br/>indemnification, and shall attempt to agree whether any action listed<br/>above in Section 4.4.8.1 shall be compromised, resisted, defended, tried or<br/>appealed.</p>
<p>4.4.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether or not any action fisted in Section 4.4.8.1 shall be<br/>compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed, the District will defer<br/>to the Association’s interest if the District does not have a distinct and<br/>separate legal interest in the matter in dispute.</p>
<p>4.4.8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for any fees, costs,<br/>charges or penalties for which the Association was not properly notified<br/>and provided the opportunity to discuss as set forth in this Article; nor will<br/>the District be entitled to any reimbursement when the District’s efforts in<br/>defending against an action would be duplicative, or when the District is<br/>defending a separate and distinct legal interest or when the District is<br/>defending an activity which is arguably subject to criminal liability on the<br/>part of any District administrator.</p>
<p>4.4.9 Duration of Service Fee Provisions</p>
<p>The service fee provisions contained in this Article shall be for the duration of this<br/>Agreement as provided in Government Code Section 3540.1(i)(2).</p>

<p>6.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association acknowledge that class size reduction legislation<br/>was enacted during the California legislature’s 1996 session and amended during the<br/>1997 session. Essentially, the legislation offered funding to the District for reducing<br/>class size to twenty students to one teacher at specified grade levels. To implement<br/>the legislation, the California Department of Education adopted “Class-Size<br/>Implementation Guidelines and Methodologies” and added specific sections to Title<br/>5, California Code of Regulations. The District decided to participate in Option A of<br/>the 1996-97 Class Size Reduction Program for grades one and two. In addition, the<br/>District decided to participate in Option B of the 1996-97 Class Size Reduction<br/>Program for kindergarten classes. The District submitted an application for funding<br/>of class size reduction in kindergarten, first, and second grades. To participate in the<br/>Class Size Reduction program and receive funding, the District must comply with<br/>the Education Code and Title 5, California Code of Regulations.</p>
<p>6.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall staff classes in kindergarten through third grades at twenty-to-one<br/>as long as the District has sufficient classroom facilities available and actually<br/>receives funds from the State of California under the Class Size Reduction Program.<br/>If the legislation and/or regulations change, the District and CETA agree to meet and</p>
<p>-20-</p>
<p>negotiate before changing the twenty-to-one class size in kindergarten through third<br/>grades.</p>

This provision shall be applicable only to members of<br/>the STRS who have met the criteria provided in the Education Code and are not<br/>older than sixty-five (65) years, and is limited to a period of five (5) years of such<br/>part-time status.</p>
<p>17.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who terminate before the end of the school term or the school year<br/>will receive retirement credit based on the salary actually paid in the proportion that<br/>it relates to the annual salary that would have been paid had the employment</p>
<p>-77-</p>
<p>continued. Retirement contributions for services not actually performed will be<br/>returned to the unit member and the District. If a unit member works less than one<br/>hundred percent (100%) of his/her assignment, the amount of sick leave earned<br/>varies directly to the percent of full-time employment. That is, fifty percent (50%)<br/>employment would yield ten (10) days of half-time sick leave or five (5) days of full¬<br/>time sick leave.</p>
<p>17.1.6 A unit member on less than full-time employment, who must use sick leave, will<br/>reduce earned sick leave on the same basis as his/her employment.</p>
<p>17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Retirement/Consultant Contract</p>
<p>Early retirees who meet the retirement criteria set forth in Education Code Section 35046 may<br/>enter into a consultancy contract, an agreement with the District to provide services to the<br/>District. The District retains the right to determine the person(s) selected, the length of<br/>service, and the nature of the service. Early retirees who are selected will be paid at a rate of<br/>one hundred fifty dollars ($150) per day or a fractional part of that amount not to exceed<br/>seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) per year for services rendered. Retirees may<br/>also work as substitutes for the District and shall be paid twenty-five dollars ($25) per day in<br/>addition to the prevailing substitute rate.</p>
<p>17.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiree Benefits</p>
<p>17.3.1 Conditions</p>
<p>The following conditions must be met in order to receive benefits pursuant to<br/>Section 17.3.2 or 17.3.3:</p>
<p>17.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement commencing after age fifty-five (55) shall be purely<br/>voluntary on the part of the unit member.</p>
<p>17.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member must have a minimum of ten (10) years of service in the<br/>Campbell Union School District in a position requiring certification.</p>
<p>17.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must permanently resign from the District in order to<br/>be eligible for this program. A unit member who returns to the District<br/>pursuant to Section 17.5 remains eligible for this program.</p>
<p>-78-</p>
<p>17.3.2 The District will contribute up to three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars<br/>($3,250) per year toward the cost of the employee and spouse coverage in a medical<br/>and dental health plan benefit program offered by the District. The District’s<br/>contribution of up to three thousand two hundred and fifty dollars ($3,250) shall<br/>continue for seven (7) years, or until employee is eligible for health benefits under<br/>Federal of State programs (i.e.. Medicare, Medi-Cal), whichever comes first. If there<br/>are changes in health and welfare fringe benefit carriers, participants in the early<br/>retirement plan will also be changed to the new carrier provided the new carrier will<br/>accept the risk. If the employee becomes eligible for health benefits under Federal<br/>or State programs and has not received a total of seven (7) years of District<br/>contribution toward the cost of retirees medical and dental plans, the District shall<br/>contribute up to one thousand seven hundred dollars ($1,700) per year toward the<br/>cost of Medicare or Medi-Cal supplemental coverage and/or a dental plan until the<br/>employee has received a total of seven (7) years of contributions. If there are<br/>changes in health and welfare fringe benefit carriers, participants in the early<br/>retirement plan will also be changed to the new carrier provided the new carrier will<br/>accept the risk.</p>
<p>17.4 Retirement for District Determined Disability</p>
<p>17.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will establish a special annuity program for unit members who the<br/>District determines to suffer from a bona fide partial disability which has<br/>substantially reduced prior effectiveness in the classroom.</p>

<p>17.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for this program shall require:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;initiation by the unit member;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least twenty (20) years of service to the District;</p>

<p>17.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private sources or through the STRS. The granting of this benefit and the<br/>determination of the amount of benefits shall be at the Governing Board’s total<br/>discretion.</p>

<p>17.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired Temporary Teachers and Retired Temporary Remedial Teachers shall not<br/>receive health and welfare benefits pursuant to Article 10, Section 10.5 of this<br/>Agreement, but instead shall continue to receive the retiree benefit contributions for<br/>these teachers shall not be extended beyond those specified in Sections 17.3.2 and</p>
<p>17.3.3.</p>
<p>17.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired Temporary Teachers and Retired Temporary Remedial Teachers shall not be<br/>subject to the evaluation requirements of Article 17.5.</p>
<p>17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent Participation</p>

<p>-82-</p>
<p>ARTICLE 18</p>
<p>WAIVER PROCESS FOR CHANGING BARRIERS TO SITE-BASED SHARED<br/>RESPONSIBILITY AND DECISION MAKING (SBSRDM!</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBSRDM</p>
<p>In appropriate circumstances, SBSRDM will be used in the District. Barriers or limitations to<br/>this process will be removed by using a case-by-case waiver of those contributing forces,<br/>which include Board Policy, collective agreements, the Education Code, and Central Services.<br/>The parties agree to adopt the following procedure for waiving provisions of this collective<br/>bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>The request for a waiver should be forwarded to the District Superintendent and CETA<br/>president who shall seek approval of the waiver according to the provisions of 18.3. If either<br/>the Association or the District request verification, the site shall submit verification that by a<br/>2/3 vote the staff approved the waiver. A waiver request shall include at least the following:</p>
<p>18.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific provision of the collective bargaining agreement to be waived.</p>
<p>18.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement language which will be in effect in place of the waived language.</p>
<p>18.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members (and positions) who would be affected by the change, and a<br/>statement that by a 2/3 vote these members agreed to the change.</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiver Approval</p>
<p>If the waiver involves an adjustment to a collective agreement, the waiver does not become<br/>effective until the adjustment is approved in writing by CETA and the Board. If the waiver<br/>involves a change in Board Policy, the Board must approve. If the waiver involves an<br/>alteration of Central Services, the Superintendent must approve. If the waiver involves the<br/>Education Code, the established procedure for Education Code waivers will be utilized.</p>
<p>-83-</p>
<p>18.4</p>
<p>Record of Waivers</p>
<p>All waivers that are approved by the appropriate parties will be reduced to writing and<br/>numbered for reference.</p>

<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no limit on the number of participants at each site.</p>
<p>WHAT:</p>
<p>Teachers will develop an action research question and collect evidence through<br/>a portfolio to address the research question. The plan must be based on teacher<br/>investigation, data collection and analysis and/or research.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>WHEN:</p>
<p>Timelines follow those in Article 7 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oct. 1: Information to unit members related to the evaluation process<br/>(Section 7.4)</p>
