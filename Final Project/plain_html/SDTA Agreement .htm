<p>1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to provide one (1) copy of any public document to the Association<br/>upon request from the Association and upon reimbursement to the District of all clerical<br/>and material costs involved in the duplication of the public document, unless the<br/>Superintendent or designee determines that said document has already been duplicated in<br/>such quantity as to make additional charges unnecessary.</p>

For the individual on leave, the<br/>calculation of the district average teacher cost will include salary, retirement fund<br/>contributions, all other benefit premiums, and all fixed charges (salary driven costs).<br/>Granting of this leave to the Association president shall not interfere with that unit<br/>member’s normal advancement on the salary schedule. Should the Association president<br/>return to the classroom, he or she shall have the right to return to his or her former school.<br/>The district will make best efforts to return the member to the same or equivalent teaching<br/>assignment as he or she had prior to serving as Association president.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ARTICLE III - ORGANIZATIONAL RIGHTS - Section 1.15</p>
<p>1.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to provide the Association with the addresses for unit members as<br/>soon as it is administratively practicable after the address roster is completed in the fall.</p>

<p>2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have the right to form, join, or participate in the<br/>organization(s) of their choice, except as provided otherwise.</p>
<p>2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member who is a member of the Association on the effective date<br/>of this Agreement and each unit member covered by this Agreement who<br/>becomes a member after that date shall maintain his/her membership in the<br/>Association at least until the expiration of this Agreement, except that<br/>members of the Association may withdraw their membership in the<br/>Association during the month of June of the final year of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dues Deduction for Maintenance .of Membership</p>
<p>2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to deduct from the pay of each eligible Association<br/>member covered by this Agreement, the regular Association membership dues<br/>provided that at the time of such deduction there is in the possession of the<br/>District a voluntarily written assignment form executed by the employee<br/>authorizing such deduction by the District. Revocation of dues deduction<br/>may be made on the payroll deduction assignment form only as provided in<br/>Section 2.1 above.</p>
<p>2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed, or<br/>discontinued deduction until the pay period commencing thirty (30) days or<br/>more after such submission.</p>
<p>2.3 Agency Fee</p>
<p>2.3.1 Unit members who are members of the Association and who do not wish their<br/>membership dues paid by payroll deduction may file with the superintendent<br/>or designee a written declaration requesting no payroll deduction. This<br/>declaration must be on file within 30 days of the first date classes are in<br/>session in each fiscal year, or within 30 days of employment, if employed<br/>after the beginning of the school year. The District will grant the request, but</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>ARTICLE III</p>
<p>2.3.2</p>
<p>2.3.3</p>
<p>2.3.4</p>
<p>2.3.5</p>
<p>2.3.6</p>
<p>2.3.7</p>
<p>will notify the unit members that they are still obligated to pay the dues<br/>directly to the Association, that the Association will be notified of the grant of<br/>the request, and that the Association may bring legal action to enforce the<br/>membership dues payment. The District will notify the Association of all<br/>requests to stop payroll deductions for membership dues and the District will<br/>have no further obligation to collect such membership dues.</p>
<p>For a unit member who is not a member of the Association or who does not<br/>wish to become a member, agency fee payments will be made by payroll<br/>deduction in accordance with the rules of the Public Employment Relations<br/>Board to effectuate the policies announced by the Supreme Court in Chicago<br/>Teacher’s Union. Local No. 1 vs. Hudson, as amended from time to time.<br/>However, unit members not wishing such fee to be paid by payroll deduction<br/>may sign and deliver to the District a written declaration requesting that such<br/>deduction not be made. This declaration must be on file within 30 days of the<br/>first date classes are in session in the new fiscal year, or within 30 days of<br/>employment, if employed after the beginning of the school year. The District<br/>shall grant the request, but shall notify the employee that he/she is still<br/>obligated to pay the fees directly to the Association, that the Association will<br/>be notified of the grant of the request, and that the Association may bring<br/>legal action to enforce the agency fee contract provisions. The District shall<br/>have no further obligation to collect such fees.</p>
<p>Unless there is a declaration as provided in Section 2.3.1 on file, the District<br/>shall deduct one-tenth of such agency fee from the regular salary check of the<br/>employee each month for ten months. Deductions for unit members<br/>employed after the commencement of the school year shall be appropriately<br/>prorated. Such deduction shall continue in effect until revoked in writing by<br/>the employee as provided in Section 2.3.1 above. The District will forward a<br/>copy of such revocation to the Association.</p>
<p>The District shall remit the agency fees together with an accounting to the<br/>Association monthly and in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>The Association assumes responsibility for collection of dues and fees from<br/>those unit members who have filed a written request not to have such dues or<br/>fees deducted, provided the District has given notice to the Association<br/>pursuant to Section 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 above. The District has no obligation for<br/>collection of any dues or fees which unit members have requested to be<br/>exempt from payroll deduction.</p>
<p>Payment of dues or agency fees shall not be a condition of employment.</p>
<p>Any unit member who belongs to a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee<br/>organizations, or who has formed such a religious conviction based upon</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ARTICLE III - ORGANIZATIONAL RIGHTS - Section 2.3.7 (Continued)</p>
<p>his/her own study or religious practice, may execute a declaration attesting to<br/>the fact thereof and upon filing it with the superintendent or designee,<br/>together with a copy to the president of the Association, shall be exempt from<br/>payment of agency fees, provided that</p>
<p>2.3.7.1 the member provides proof of payment of an amount equal to the<br/>agency fee to one or more of the following nonreligious,<br/>charitable organizations exempt from taxation under Section 501</p>
<p>(c) (3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code: Girl Scouts of<br/>America, United Way, American Heart Association, American<br/>Cancer Society, or similar charity subject to mutual agreement<br/>between the Association and the District. Contribution may also<br/>be made to any Sequoia Union High School District tax<br/>deductible school site student scholarship fund; and</p>
<p>23.1.2 the declaration is sufficient as to form and content. The</p>
<p>Association and the District shall agree upon a form to be used<br/>for this purpose as soon as practicable. Such form will be<br/>attached to this Agreement as Exhibit 1. Sufficiency of the<br/>declaration shall be determined as established by the Ninth<br/>Circuit Court of Appeal in I AM v Boeing. If either the District<br/>or the Association challenges its sufficiency, the question shall be<br/>resolved by a panel of three persons. This panel will be<br/>composed of one member to be selected by the District, one<br/>member selected by the Association, and one member selected by<br/>the other two members. The panelists shall not inquire into the<br/>faith or belief or practice of such member. Its sole purpose<br/>shall be to determine the sufficiency of the statement thereof. Its<br/>decision shall be final. However, it may, in its discretion, permit<br/>one amended declaration to allow the claimant to cure any<br/>defects it finds.</p>
<p>2.3.13 Upon filing such a declaration, the unit member’s payments, if<br/>they are being withheld, shall be placed in a trust account and<br/>there held until the panel’s decision. Following the decision, they<br/>will be disbursed either to the Association or to the designated<br/>charity.</p>
<p>2.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time agency fee provisions are in effect, maintenance of membership<br/>obligation in Section 2.2 above shall be inoperative. At all other times during<br/>the term of this Agreement the District shall provide maintenance of<br/>membership as defined in Government Code Section 3540.1(i)(l).</p>
<p>2.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed, or<br/>discontinued deduction until the pay period commencing thirty (30) days or<br/>more after such submission.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ARTICLE III - ORGANIZATIONAL RIGHTS - Section 2.4</p>
<p>2.4 Indemnity</p>
<p>The Association shall indemnify and hold the District harmless for any claims and against<br/>any lawsuit or other action arising from the administration and implementation of this<br/>Article. Such indemnification shall include any attorney’s fees reasonably expended by<br/>the District in defending against such claim or suit. The Association shall have the right<br/>to decide and determine which matters shall or shall not be compromised, resisted,<br/>defended, tried or appealed. This indemnity provision does not include claims sustained<br/>against the District for improper administration of the terms of this Article.</p>
<p>Section 3 - Record Keeping</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel records shall be kept in compliance with Board Policy 4112.6.</p>
<p>3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature shall not be entered or filed unless and until the<br/>employee is given notice and an opportunity to review and respond. An employee<br/>shall have the right to have his own comments attached to any derogatory statement to<br/>be included in the file.</p>
<p>3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every employee shall have the right to inspect his/her personnel file upon request,<br/>provided that reasonable notice is given and that the request is made for a time when<br/>the person is not actually required to render services to the employing district.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members meeting with administrators shall be notified before the meeting of the<br/>meeting’s purpose. Administrators will provide unit members with notice of the right to<br/>Association representation if the meeting is investigatory in nature or may lead to an adverse<br/>personnel action. In addition, during any meeting without an Association representative, if it<br/>becomes apparent that the meeting could result in an adverse personnel action, the<br/>administrator shall offer to end the meeting and reschedule it when Association<br/>representation is available.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Administrators receiving formal or written complaints about bargaining unit members shall<br/>notify unit members of such complaints as soon as possible. Complaints not given to unit<br/>members in this timely manner will not be used for disciplinary purposes later. Such<br/>notification shall occur, whenever possible, before further administrative action. Bargaining<br/>unit members maintain the right to respond to any complaint.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV</p>
<p>HOURS</p>
<p>Section 1 - General</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize that the varying nature of a unit member’s day<br/>to day professional responsibility does not lend itself solely to an instructional day of<br/>rigidly established length. It is agreed that the professional day consists of adequate time<br/>to meet all professional and contractual responsibilities which are necessary for the<br/>efficient operation of the District.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In assigning duties and professional responsibilities, site administrators shall make a<br/>reasonable effort to see that the hours and duties involved are equitably distributed among<br/>the staff, with volunteers sought prior to mandating an assignment that is beyond the<br/>instructional day, and that whenever practicable, reasonable advance notice of scheduling<br/>is provided.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers will remain on campus available to staff and students during their preparation<br/>periods, except as provided in Section 5.7 of this Article. For schools with a seven period<br/>schedule, preparation periods will be assigned at a rate of two preparation periods per<br/>week for each period of full time equivalent teaching assignment. For schools on block<br/>schedule, classes meeting 90 minutes or more shall be equivalent to two class periods of<br/>full time equivalent teaching assignment. Subject to Section 2.4, weekly preparation<br/>periods will be as follows:</p>
<p>Periods Taught &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worked</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</p>
<p>Section 2 - Classroom Teachers</p>
<p>2.1 Reporting Time and Procedures</p>
<p>2.1.1 In addition to the provisions of Section 1 above, the work day for classroom<br/>teacher members of the unit shall begin fifteen (15) minutes prior to the<br/>beginning of the first regular period of the school day. “Shall begin” means<br/>the unit member is to be on campus working on professional duties and<br/>available to students and/or administrators. A unit member with no first<br/>period class will be in an agreed upon location.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Unit members shall be on campus and working, except for the unit member’s<br/>lunch period, until the end of the last regularly scheduled period of the school<br/>day, except as provided in Section 5.7 of this article.</p>
<p>Those classroom teacher members of the unit who have special assignments<br/>shall have reporting times designated by the principal, program administrator,<br/>or management designee.</p>
<p>Regularly scheduled faculty meetings shall be held during the regular work<br/>hours. Principals will make a reasonable effort to see that scheduling of<br/>required faculty meetings during preparation periods is infrequent.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting Time and Procedures - Part-time Employees</p>
<p>2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work day, unless otherwise noted in the Agreement, for the classroom<br/>teacher members of the unit employed less than full time shall begin fifteen<br/>(15) minutes prior to the beginning of the first assigned period and end fifteen<br/>(15) minutes following the last assigned period, including preparation time.<br/>“Shall begin” has the same meaning as in Section 2.1.1 above. Part-time<br/>classroom teachers shall be responsible for being on campus during the<br/>preparation periods provided in Section 2.4 below.</p>
<p>2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Section 1 of the Article shall apply to part-time classroom<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time classroom teachers shall have not more than twenty-five (25) regularly assigned<br/>teaching periods or equivalent teaching load per week; or thirty (30) regularly assigned<br/>teaching periods or equivalent teaching load per week at the continuation high school. For<br/>schools on a block schedule, the number of regularly assigned periods shall not exceed an<br/>average of twenty-five (25) over a two-week period. Classes meeting 90 minutes or more<br/>shall be equivalent to two class periods of full-time teaching assignment.</p>
<p>2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time classroom teachers shall have a minimum of one (1) preparation period per day.<br/>Continuation high school teachers shall have two (2) preparation periods per day.<br/>Part-time classroom teachers shall have preparation time in the same proportion that their<br/>assignment is to full time.</p>
<p>2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section precludes a classroom teacher from volunteering to teach<br/>additional classes.</p>
<p>2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this section precludes the administration from assigning a unit member to<br/>“cover” for another teacher in the event of an unexpected absence, provided that these<br/>additional assignments are infrequent. Unit members assigned to “cover” for another<br/>teacher shall be compensated at an hourly rate of $40 per period and $80 per block period.</p>
<p>2.1.2</p>
<p>2.1.3</p>
<p>2.1.4</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Section 3 - Other Members of the Bargaining Unit</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting Time and Procedures</p>
<p>Reporting time and procedures for counselors shall be the same as those provided in<br/>Section 2.1 above.</p>
<p>Unit members with duties other than a classroom assignment will work the same length of<br/>professional day as classroom teachers, although the time for reporting, leaving, and the<br/>lunch period will be determined by the nature of the service to be rendered as decided by<br/>the supervisor after consultation with the unit member involved.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting Time and Procedures - Part-time Employees</p>
<p>The work day, unless otherwise noted in the Agreement, for unit members assigned other<br/>than a classroom assignment who are employed less than full time shall be prorated on the<br/>basis of the percentage of full time for which the unit member is employed, with<br/>beginning and ending times established by the principal or program administrator.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Section 1 of this Article shall apply to unit members assigned other than<br/>a classroom assignment, including those with a part-time assignment.</p>

For employees choosing this option,<br/>the cafeteria fund amount defined in Section 1.6 of this Article shall be reduced by the<br/>amount of the full dental premium.</p>
<p>1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee has declined health coverage and desires to maintain district-paid dental<br/>coverage and/or vision coverage, the District will continue to pay the cost of either or both<br/>premium(s) while still providing the employee with fifty percent of the highest single<br/>active health premium as a cash back payment, prorated for part-time unit members.</p>

<p>Section 3 - Health Insurance for Retirees</p>
<p>3.1 Through CalPERS the District agrees to provide qualifying unit members upon retirement<br/>at age sixty-five (65) with eligibility to participate in the CalPERS benefits program at<br/>CalPERS Retiree Supplement Rates.

<p>following formats: (1) Formal Conference evaluation or (2) Self-Assessment evaluation.<br/>Probationary unit members shall be evaluated every year using the Formal Conference<br/>format. Unit members with permanent status shall be evaluated every other year using the<br/>Formal Conference format or the Self-Assessment format if Article VIII, Section 6 is<br/>applicable. At the discretion of the principal, permanent status members may skip one<br/>evaluation cycle. Those members who have selected to skip a cycle will be notified by the<br/>principal within 30 calendar day following the first work day of the school year for unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Conference evaluations require identification of three (3) standards, and<br/>for a classroom teacher, a minimum of three formal classroom observations<br/>conducted by the designated evaluator.</p>
<p>1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-Assessment evaluation requires agreement between evaluator and unit<br/>member regarding three (3) standards to be assessed and assessment methods as<br/>described in section 6.2 of this article.</p>

<p>1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one (1) preliminary conference will be held within fifty (50) calendar days<br/>following the first work day of the school year for unit members or sixty (60) calendar<br/>days for those on Self Assessment at which time the evaluator and evaluatee will<br/>determine the nature of the assessment that will be done, prepare the Pre Evaluation<br/>Conference form and review the manner in which the evaluation will be carried out.</p>
<p>1.5.1 Any Standard on which a teacher referred to the Partnership Program receives a<br/>designation of &quot;Not Met&quot; shall be included in the Formal Conference evaluation<br/>during the Partnership Program year.</p>
<p>1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District shall mutually agree to forms used to initiate evaluation<br/>goals and objectives and to summarize an annual evaluation. Current forms are included in<br/>Exhibit 2 of this Agreement and shall remain in use until modified by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Section 2 - Assessment Methods</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Standards for the Teaching Profession, most recently adopted by the State,<br/>shall provide the basis for the evaluation of classroom teachers and shall provide the<br/>foundation for assistance provided.</p>
<p>2.1.1 These Standards are adopted for the sole purpose of providing assistance to<br/>classroom teachers and recognizing and supporting quality instruction.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of classroom teachers shall be based on three (3) of the six (6) standards<br/>agreed to by the evaluator and the teacher in the pre evaluation conference as the designated<br/>standards. If there is a difference of opinion in identifying these standards: one (1) Standard<br/>shall be identified by the classroom teacher and two (2) Standards by the evaluator.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the approval of the principal and in consultation with the evaluatee, the evaluator<br/>may substitute an alternative Standard as the designated Standard if a need is so<br/>determined. The evaluatee continues to retain the right to select one (1) of the three (3)<br/>designated standards pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Article. This action shall be taken by<br/>the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-service training related to evaluation based on the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession shall be conducted for administrators and offered to classroom teachers.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII - PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATIONS - Section 3</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation will be based upon the Key Elements of the Standards. The assessment<br/>methods may include: formal classroom observations, drop-in visits, examples of student<br/>work, review of teacher developed lessons and work products, and information relating to<br/>teacher implementation of board adopted content standards and standards of student<br/>progress adopted by the board.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the permanent classroom teacher's assignment, the subject matter, grade<br/>level taught and the area in which the teacher has been credentialed will assist in<br/>determining the emphasis which will be placed on the Key Elements.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom observations will be a key source of evidence for the teacher evaluation.<br/>Ordinarily, teachers on Formal Conference evaluation will be observed on three (3)<br/>occasions, or for two full block periods. If after two observations of a permanent<br/>classroom teacher, the evaluator determines that all three of the designated standards have<br/>been met, then a third required observation may be waived by mutual agreement of the<br/>unit member and the evaluator.</p>
<p>3.3.1 Non-tenured unit members will have at least the 1<sup>st</sup> formal observation and<br/>post-observation conference prior to the Winter Break.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of at least one classroom observation shall be a full class period. Ordinarily,<br/>all other classroom observations pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be for a minimum of forty-<br/>five (45) minutes, however, in no circumstances will an observation be less than thirty<br/>(30) minutes.</p>
<p>3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the evaluator observes conditions in the first or second observation that may<br/>lead to an &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; evaluation, the duration of subsequent observation(s) shall be<br/>for an entire class period. In the event the evaluator cannot observe for at least 90% of the<br/>period, the observation shall be considered a &quot;drop in visit&quot; and an additional observation<br/>will be scheduled.</p>
<p>3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom observations will be scheduled with the unit member at least three days in<br/>advance. Observations may be scheduled with less than three (3) days notice by mutual<br/>consent. The classroom teacher may request a Pre Observation Conference at the time of<br/>notification. The evaluatee will provide the evaluator a completed Observation Planning<br/>Form at least one (1) day prior to each formal observation. Observation Planning Forms<br/>may be provided with less than one day of notice by mutual consent. The evaluator<br/>reserves the right to conduct unscheduled &quot;drop in” visits for those observations that<br/>exceed the minimum amount listed in section 3.3 of this article. In the event that the<br/>evaluator cancels a scheduled classroom observation, the unit member may waive the<br/>requirement to submit a completed Observation Planning Form for the subsequently<br/>rescheduled observation. If under these circumstances the Pre-Observation Planning<br/>Form is waived, the teacher shall participate in a pre-observation conference.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII - PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATIONS - Section 3.7</p>
<p>3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom observations shall be followed by a conference with written feedback within<br/>10 days of the observation.</p>
<p>3.7.1 The post-observation conference shall include feedback on every standard<br/>selected for the evaluation including an indication that each Key Elements<br/>of the standards was “Met”, “Needs Improvement”, or “Not Observed”.</p>
<p>3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not be assessed based upon the results of standardized norm referenced<br/>test.</p>
<p>3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member's evaluation shall not be based upon his/her personal life or lifestyle.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Selection of Assessment Methods</p>
<p>4.1 The evaluator and evaluatee shall attempt to mutually agree on assessment methods.<br/>However, the evaluator shall make the final determination of the actual assessment<br/>methods for each evaluatee. If a unit member cannot concur in this determination, s/he<br/>shall so advise the evaluator and the immediate supervisor of the evaluator, who shall then<br/>confer with both the evaluatee and the evaluator and make a final determination.</p>
<p>The unit member may attach to the final determination his or her disagreement with the<br/>evaluator’s identified assessment methods.</p>
<p>Section 5 - Final Evaluation</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final overall evaluation rating for a permanent classroom teacher shall only be made<br/>when the unit member is found to be &quot;Unsatisfactory.&quot; If no unsatisfactory rating is made,<br/>the teacher is determined to have satisfactorily completed the evaluation process.</p>
<p>A final overall evaluation for unit members other than classroom teachers shall be<br/>determined as “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory.”</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classroom teacher in probationary status will not be given an overall rating on his/her<br/>Final Evaluation. Key Elements on the Probationary Teacher Performance Evaluation<br/>Form will only be marked “Met” or “Needs Improvement.” A classroom teacher in<br/>temporary status who is placed on formal conference evaluation may receive an overall<br/>rating of “Unsatisfactory.”</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A standard is determined to have been met if a majority of the Key Elements which<br/>support a specific standard have been marked &quot;Met&quot; on a classroom teacher's Formal<br/>Performance Evaluation Form.</p>
<p>5.3.1 The Rubric will be used to determine whether or not a Key Element has been met.<br/>The Rubric is included as an exhibit in this Agreement.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII - PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATIONS - Section 5.3.1.1</p>
<p>5.3.1.1 Since the Key Element Rubric performance indicators may be listed</p>
<p>more than once in support of a Key Element, consideration will be taken<br/>when using such indicators to support evidence of failure to meet a Key<br/>Element or a standard.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Final Evaluation the evaluator shall rely upon data collected through<br/>observations, collection of relevant data as described in Section 3.1, and evaluation<br/>conferences with the evaluatee.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An overall Unsatisfactory rating will be determined when the permanent classroom<br/>teacher fails to meet at least two of the three designated standards. (Or a standard<br/>subsequently substituted by the end of the first quarter).</p>
<p>5.5.1 An '’Unsatisfactory&quot; rating on the final formal evaluation form of a permanent<br/>classroom teacher will be accompanied by related and specifically documented<br/>evidence on each Standard, which is determined to be &quot;Not Met.&quot;</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In circumstances where, in the principal’s professional judgment, student learning is in<br/>serious jeopardy or where the work of others is negatively impacted to a serious degree, a<br/>determination of &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; for a permanent classroom teacher may be made if only<br/>one standard is designated as &quot;Not Met.&quot;</p>
<p>5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rating of Unsatisfactory on the Final Performance Evaluation Form for a permanent<br/>classroom teacher shall result in a referral to the Partnership Program.</p>
<p>5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the final evaluation shall be given to the unit member no later than 30 calendar<br/>days prior to the end of the school year. The unit member will be given the opportunity to<br/>discuss the evaluation with the evaluator. The unit member shall sign the evaluation form<br/>signifying only that s/he has read the document and has been provided the opportunity of<br/>attaching a written response within ten (10) school days. The evaluation and the response<br/>shall be placed in the unit member's personnel file.</p>
<p>5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator may recommend that a permanent classroom teacher who does not meet one<br/>of the three designated Standards be returned to Formal Conference Evaluation and/or<br/>participate in the Partnership Program as a Volunteer Teacher in the succeeding year<br/>under either of the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher has five (5) Key Elements within the three designated Standards<br/>determined as “Not Met.”</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher has a combination of seven (7) or more Key Elements within the three<br/>designated Standards determined as “Not Met” or “Needs Improvement.”</p>
<p>In each instance the teacher will return to Formal Conference to work to improve on the<br/>designated Standards and Key Elements that were marked “Not Met” or “Needs<br/>Improvement.” If the teacher volunteers to participate in the Partnership Program, the<br/>teacher will meet with the principal between April 1 and May 1 to provide a self-report of<br/>his or her participation in the program. No written record will be kept from this meeting.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII - PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATIONS - Section 5.10</p>
<p>5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member assigned to participate in the Partnership Program who is determined to<br/>have met at least two (2) standards on his/her concurrent final evaluation during the year<br/>of participation will return to the normal two year evaluation cycle unless otherwise<br/>determined on the Principal's Recommendation Form.</p>
<p>5.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for dismissing probationary unit members during the school year are found in<br/>Board Policy 4117. Procedures for terminating probationary unit members at the end of<br/>the school year are found in Education Code Section 44885(b) and 44929.21.</p>
<p>Section 6 - Self-Assessment</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent unit member scheduled for an evaluation who has been determined to have<br/>met standards on his/her two most recent evaluations as a permanent employee may<br/>request to use the Self-Assessment format. The principal has the right to deny this<br/>request. The denial must be in writing and state the rationale for the denial.</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a request for Self-Assessment is denied, the unit member has the right of appeal<br/>to the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources. A meeting will be held at<br/>which the evaluatee has the right to representation. The decision of the Assistant<br/>Superintendent shall be delivered in writing and is final, and not subject to<br/>grievance. Any documentation prepared or created during the denial or appeal<br/>process shall not become part of the unit member’s permanent personnel file.</p>
<p>6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If self-assessment is denied, the unit member shall be placed on Formal<br/>Assessment Format. A unit member denied self assessment shall have the right to<br/>one change in evaluator as describe in Section 1.4. In the case of Redwood<br/>Continuation School, the member may request a change of evaluator to a district<br/>administrator selected by the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within fifty (50) calendar days following the first work day of the school year for unit<br/>members, the unit member and the designated evaluator shall meet and mutually agree<br/>upon the standards to be assessed and the assessment methods by completing a<br/>Performance Evaluation Form (Form A) Teacher Self Assessment.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher will conduct the assessment and forward to the assigned evaluator the<br/>completed Self Assessment Final Report Form. The form will be submitted forty-five<br/>(45) calendar days before the end of the school year.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator will review the self-assessment and make a final evaluation determination<br/>of &quot;Satisfactorily Completed&quot; or &quot;Unsatisfactorily Completed.&quot;</p>
<p>6.4.1 The evaluator will return the Self Assessment Final Report to the unit member<br/>within fourteen (14) calendar days after receiving the self-assessment. The unit<br/>member will keep one copy and one copy will be placed in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file along with a copy of Form A. The unit member will have seven (7)</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII - PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATIONS - Section 6.4.1 (Continued)</p>
<p>calendar days to respond to any comments made by the evaluator. The unit<br/>member's comments will be attached to the final evaluation form before it is<br/>placed in his/her personnel file.</p>
<p>6.5 Unit members on Self-Assessment who do not satisfactorily complete the assessment will<br/>be placed on Formal Conference evaluation the succeeding school year.</p>
<p>Section 7 - Non Teaching Certificated Employees</p>

<p>PROVISOS:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The positions listed above are eligible for supplementary pay at the rate defined in this appendix when</p>
<p>such positions are authorized each year by the Board of Trustees. The number of positions to be<br/>authorized are at the discretion of the Board.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall publish the schedule of fees annually and shall solicit applicants for fee schedule<br/>activity assignments from unit members prior to soliciting applicants from outside the unit or District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall normally be limited to two (2) co curricular activity stipends per school year;<br/>however, unit members shall be eligible for a third activity stipend after vacant activity positions have<br/>been solicited from unit members district-wide, outside the unit and/or outside the District, and no<br/>qualified applicants have applied for the positions.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for a co curricular activity stipend unit members must supervise regular practices and/or<br/>activities outside of school hours and supervise scheduled performances, games, and/or competitions.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation received for co curricular activity positions shall not be a part of the unit member's contract<br/>and shall be paid upon the completion of the activity or sports season. Compensation for non-athletic co<br/>curricular activities that continue throughout the school year will be paid one half (1/2) of the stipend at<br/>the end of each semester, provided District authorized time sheets and verification of completed<br/>assignments are submitted to the Human Resources office.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members whose classroom assignments are such that they would be supervising the same co<br/>curricular activity at two schools shall be eligible for a stipend at each of the schools provided minimum<br/>standards are met for each activity. An example of such assignment is Choral or Instrumental Music, but<br/>not athletic coaching.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid time on fee schedule activities does not substitute for voluntary or assigned participation in<br/>non-paying, co curricular activities.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches who coach combined teams (e.g., varsity and F/S volleyball) will be paid an additional half<br/>stipend above the varsity stipend.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If P.E. and athletics are separated so that athletics are offered only after school, the stipends will be<br/>increased by $500 for Category A and Category B and by $375 for Category C.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that &quot;after school&quot; in item #10 is to be interpreted as beginning during seventh period if<br/>this is the coach's second prep period.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional $500 will be added to the drama stipend and $375 to the journalism and yearbook stipends<br/>if the unit member teaches five classes that are not related to the activity. An example would be teaching<br/>five periods of math and serving as a drama coach.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule C is to be increased each year by the same percentage as Schedule A.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a permanent employee of a school district has tenure as a full-time employee of the District,<br/>any assignment or employment of such employee in addition to his full-time assignment may be<br/>terminated by the governing board of the District at any time.</p>

<p>Exhibit 1</p>
<p>DECLARATION REQUESTING EXEMPTION<br/>from payment of<br/>AGENCY FEES<br/>to</p>
<p>SEQUOIA DISTRICT TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>I,_, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declare,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;penalty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peijury,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on religious grounds I am to be granted</p>
<p>an exemption from payment of dues or organization security fees to the Sequoia District Teachers Association<br/>(SDTA). This request is pursuant to Article III, Section 2.3.7 of the Agreement between SDTA and the Sequoia<br/>Union High School District and is based on the following:</p>
<p>Date</p>
<p>Signature</p>
<p>LETTER OF AGREEMENT A<br/>relating to the<br/>CONTRACT<br/>between</p>
<p>SEQUOIA DISTRICT TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>SEQUOIA UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>For the duration of the Agreement, and in consideration thereof, both parties agree</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of either party, they will consult on matters of mutual interest not otherwise specifically<br/>provided in the Agreement. Such consultations are intended to ameliorate dissatisfaction with the status quo.</p>
<p>Any consultation requested under this paragraph will begin within a reasonable time, but not later than 60 days<br/>from the date a written request is received.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will refrain from personal criticism of one another. This covenant expressly excludes comment on<br/>policies on either side; however, should such comments be made, both sides covenant to be fair and reasonable to<br/>one another. Nothing herein is intended to abridge the rights of either party to exercise those rights secured by the<br/>First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District affirms its belief that its certificated staff is deserving of salary increases which protect<br/>against inflation. Economic constraints imposed by the State of California may preclude the District’s ability to<br/>fund increases commensurate with inflation. If, during the term of this agreement, those economic restraints no<br/>longer preclude it, the District will make every reasonable effort to catch up any spread between inflation<br/>following the base year 1986-87 and the compensation increases received. &quot;Inflation’’ is defined as the increase<br/>to the cost of living as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners<br/>and Clerical Workers in San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose. The increase to the cost of living is to be reduced by<br/>an amount equal to that portion of the CPI resulting from health care costs.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Trustees and the administration acknowledge that it is the perception of some of the<br/>certificated staff that they have historically not always been recognized as colleagues of equal professional<br/>standing in providing the high-quality education students enjoy. Each covenants to make all reasonable effort to<br/>overcome this perception, taking into consideration that special efforts may need to be made to listen to and act<br/>on concerns of all parties that may have been insufficiently addressed previously.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where any reference to resolution of disputes by a panel is made, it is the intention of the parties that the<br/>panel shall proceed informally. However, panel members will be guided by the general procedures provided in<br/>Title 9, California code of Civil Procedure, beginning at Section 1280.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2014-15 school year, the District shall increase the 2013-14 SDTA salary<br/>schedule in Appendix A of the collective bargaining agreement by 2.0% retroactive<br/>to July 1, 2014.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2'013-201'4-5-chcr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.0%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based</p>
<p>on the 2013-2014 SDTA salary schedule in Appendix A of the collective bargaining<br/>agreement as a one-time off schedule payment. [Note that the 2.0% is not<br/>compounded on the 2% described in section 2 above. The 2.0% one-time increase<br/>shall be prorated for less than full time unit members.]</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commencing in the 2014-15 school year, those case managers assigned entirely<br/>within the ILS and TRACE programs will be provided with a total of six (6) release<br/>days per school year, instead of four (4) as listed in Article XII, section 1.8. In<br/>addition, case managers assigned entirely within the ILS and TRACE programs will<br/>be compensated up to $2,000 per 1.0 FTE at the curricular rate of pay for case<br/>management work that is outside of the contractual work day. The aforementioned<br/>dollar amount and release days will be prorated for less than full-time employment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that this Tentative Agreement and Attachment A, dated March<br/>25, April 23, and May 12, 2014, which is incorporated by reference into this<br/>Tentative Agreement regarding revisions to the collective bargaining agreement,<br/>complete negotiations for the 2014-2015 school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement between the parties will be for a two-year term with re-openers<br/>on salary and benefits and one (1) article of the parties' collective bargaining<br/>agreement per party for the 2015-16 school year.</p>

<p>Side Letter of Agreement<br/>Between</p>
<p>Sequoia Union High School District<br/>And</p>
<p>Sequoia District Teachers Association<br/>June 19, 2014</p>
<p>This is a Side Letter of Agreement (“Side Letter of Agreement”) between the Sequoia Union<br/>High School District (“District”) and Sequoia District Teachers Association (“SDTA”). This<br/>Side Letter of Agreement is contingent upon the finalization the Charter School MOU between<br/>the District and Stanford Schools Corp., Inc. and is not precedent-setting for any other District<br/>small schools in the future.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>East Palo Alto Academy (“EPAA”) has operated as an “independent” charter school since it was<br/>authorized by the District to commence operations on July 1, 2012. EPAA has materially<br/>revised its charter petition, referred to hereafter as “revised charter,” so that it is “dependent” in<br/>nature. In accordance with Education Code sections 47605(b)(5)(O) and 47511.5, EPAA has, in<br/>the revised charter, deemed the District to be the exclusive public school employer of the<br/>employees at the charter school for the purposes of Section 3540.1 of the Government Code<br/>effective July 1, 2014.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2014, the District wishes to hire certain certificated employees assigned to<br/>EPAA (“EPAA employees employed on June 30, 2014”) as probationary or temporary<br/>certificated District employees, and the parties agree to include such probationary and temporary<br/>certificated employees in the SDTA bargaining unit. Said EPAA employees shall be afforded<br/>the term and conditions afforded by the District as set forth in this Side Letter of Agreement.</p>
<p>The parties agree that EPAA’s program is unique in nature and that, as a result, not all provisions<br/>of parties’ collective bargaining agreement will be applicable to EPAA employees. The parties<br/>further agree that, with respect to certificated employees assigned to EPAA, not all terms of the<br/>parties’ collective bargaining agreement are applicable to those employees, and a degree of<br/>flexibility must exist in order for the District to administer the EPAA program consistent with<br/>the intent of EPAA’s revised charter and in the spirit of Charter Schools Act of 1992 as set forth<br/>in Education Code section 47600 et seq.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The District and SDTA hereby agree to the following:</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective date: Upon execution by both parties of this Side Letter of Agreement and<br/>upon approval of the Charter School MOU between the District and Stanford Schools Corp.,<br/>Inc., this Side Letter of Agreement becomes effective on July 1, 2014 or on the approval date of<br/>the MOU, whichever date is later.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent of Parties: The intent of this Side Letter of Agreement is to specifically indicate<br/>which Articles of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement apply to EPAA employees and<br/>which Articles of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement are not applicable to EPAA<br/>employees. Moreover, this Side Letter of Agreement specifies to the greatest extent possible<br/>terms specific to EPAA employees. In the event that no provision of the parties’ collective<br/>bargaining agreement or this Side Letter of Agreement addresses a specific issue or conflict, the<br/>parties agree to immediately schedule negotiations to address the matter.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the parties’ collective bargaining agreement shall apply to EPAA<br/>employees, but only to the extent described in this Side Letter of Agreement.</p>
<p>The following collective bargaining agreement Articles do apply to EPAA employees during the<br/>term of this Side Letter of agreement. Any Articles that are not listed below are modified in this</p>
