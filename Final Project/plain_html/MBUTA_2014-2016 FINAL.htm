<p>ARTICLE 2: DISTRICT RETAINED RIGHTS</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not covered under this Agreement or within the scope of consultation</p>
<p>in Government Code 3543.2 are reserved to the District including, but not limited</p>
<p>to:</p>
<p>2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial structure of the District, including sources of income, taxes<br/>and debt, investment policies, fiscal and budget control policies and<br/>procedures, budgetary allocations, and expenditures apart from those<br/>expressly allocated to fund the wages, benefits or other obligations of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition, disposition, and utilization of all District properties.</p>
<p>2.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All services to be rendered to the public excluding teachers services as<br/>provided for elsewhere in this Agreement but including personnel,<br/>facilities, vendors, supplies, materials, vehicles, equipment and tools to be<br/>used in connection with such services, the lawful subcontracting of<br/>services to be rendered and functions to be performed.</p>
<p>2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The utilization of personnel not covered by this Agreement, including<br/>substitutes, provisional personnel, consultants, instructional aides,<br/>classified employees, confidential employees and supervisory or<br/>managerial personnel, and the methods of selection and assignment of<br/>such personnel.</p>

<p>4</p>
<p>intention that the clear and explicit provisions of the other Articles of this<br/>Agreement constitute the only contractual limitation upon the District’s rights.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the District to exercise any right reserved to it shall not be deemed a<br/>waiver of such rights.</p>
<p>2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the contractual rights of the Association and of unit members are set<br/>forth in the other Articles of this Agreement and that this Article is not a source of<br/>such rights. Accordingly, any dispute arising out of or in any way connected with<br/>either the existence of or the exercise of any of the above-described rights of the<br/>District, or arising out of or in any way connected with the effects of the exercise of<br/>such rights, is not subject to the grievance provisions set forth in Article 4, unless<br/>the grievance in question is an allegation that the District has violated an express<br/>provision of some other Article of this Agreement, which Article is itself subject to<br/>arbitration.</p>

<p>8</p>
<p>(60<sup>th</sup>) day following either the date upon which this Agreement is executed<br/>or the date upon which said employee has been formally hired by the<br/>District as a bargaining unit employee, whichever date is later, must as a<br/>condition of employment in the District pay annually to the Association a<br/>representation fee, in exchange for representation services necessarily<br/>performed by the Association in conformance with its legally imposed<br/>duty of fair representation on behalf of said unit member who is not a<br/>member of the Association.</p>
<p>3.7.4 Definition of Representation Fee</p>
<p>The Representation fee collected from non-Association unit members<br/>pursuant to Section 3.7.3 above shall be limited to an amount equal to the<br/>Association’s (MBUTA/CTA/NEA) annual dues for representing such<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>3.7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This “representation fee” shall include only those costs actually<br/>incurred by the Association in representing unit members, who are<br/>not also members of the Association, in matters specifically and<br/>directly connected with the enforcement and administration of this<br/>Agreement, the adjustment of grievances, and litigation pertaining<br/>thereto.</p>
<p>3.7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such representation fee shall exclude all other costs, fees and<br/>assessments including, but not limited to: Association fines, back<br/>dues, initiation fees, or any other charge required as a condition of<br/>Association membership; any and all amounts which may be used,<br/>directly or indirectly, for political or ideological activities; any and<br/>all amounts which do not constitute costs actually incurred by the<br/>Association in representation matters specifically and directly<br/>connected with the bargaining of, enforcement and administration<br/>of this Agreement; the adjustment of grievances, and the litigation<br/>pertaining thereto.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>3.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions</p>
<p>Exceptions to Section 3.7.3 shall be as follows: Full-time, non-exempt<br/>bargaining unit members hired during the school year shall pay a prorated<br/>representation fee. Such pro rata share shall be based upon the number of<br/>days of actual scheduled service for a school year as compared with the<br/>number of days available for full-time employment in the school year.</p>
<p>Any fraction of a month shall be counted as a full month. Part-time, non¬<br/>exempt bargaining unit members shall pay a prorated representation fee on<br/>the basis of said employee’s annual salary as compared with the same<br/>annual salary for a comparable full-time employee.</p>
<p>3.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Verification of Representation Fee By Association</p>
<p>At least thirty (30) days prior to the collection of a representation fee from<br/>any unit member pursuant to these provisions, the Association shall<br/>submit a written certification to the District verifying that the total amount<br/>of its representation fee conforms to Section 3.7.4 above, and itemizing all<br/>component parts of such fee. Each year such amount shall be verified and<br/>submitted in writing to the District by the Association within thirty (30)<br/>days of August 1. The parties agree that such annual certification is a<br/>condition precedent to the collection by either the District or the<br/>Association of a representation fee from a unit member.</p>
<p>3.7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees Exempted From Obligation To Pay Association</p>
<p>No unit member shall be required to make an agency representation fee<br/>payment if the unit member is an actual verified member of a bona fide<br/>religion, body or sect that has historically held conscientious objections to<br/>joining or financially supporting employee organizations.</p>
<p>3.7.7.1 Such exempt unit member shall, as an alternative to payment of a<br/>representation fee to the Association, pay an amount equivalent to<br/>such representation fee to: (a) The United Way; (b) The<br/>Children’s Hospital; (c) Manhattan Beach Education Foundation;<br/>or (d) Any charity jointly agreed upon by the District and the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>3.7.7.2 The Association, upon written request, may require such exempt<br/>unit member to submit a written affidavit to the Association<br/>verifying the existence and nature of the allowable objection to<br/>payment of a representation fee. In addition, the Association may<br/>require such exempt unit member to submit proof of payment of an<br/>amount equivalent to such representation fee to one of the<br/>alternative funds or organizations listed above.</p>
<p>3.7.8 Payment Method</p>
<p>Any unit members who are not exempted from payment under Section</p>
<p>3.7.7 above may pay annually the properly-determined representation fee<br/>directly to the Association.</p>
<p>3.7.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative to the direct payment method, aunit member may<br/>voluntarily sign and deliver to the District a written assignment<br/>authorizing deduction of the properly established representation<br/>fee as defined in Section 3.7.4 above, subject to the conditions set<br/>forth elsewhere in this Agreement for payroll deductions. Upon<br/>voluntary authorizations duly completed and executed, the District<br/>will deduct from the pay of unit members and pay to the<br/>Association the normal and regular monthly representation fee.</p>
<p>3.7.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member who is not exempted from payment<br/>under Section 3.7.7 does not voluntarily sign and deliver to the<br/>District an authorization pursuant to section 3.7.3 or pay annually<br/>the representation fee directly to the Association pursuant to<br/>Section 3.7.8, the Association may request in writing that the<br/>District deduct from the pay of the unit member and pay to the<br/>Association the normal and regular monthly representation fee<br/>without the approval of the unit member. Prior to making a<br/>request for the District to involuntarily deduct the representation<br/>fee from any unit member’s pay, the Association shall notify the<br/>unit member of the request. If the unit member and the<br/>Association are unable to reach agreement on the manner of <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>11</p>
<p>payment, the District shall be obligated to make such deductions as<br/>requested by the Association.</p>
<p>3.7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District is under no obligation to make payroll deductions for periods<br/>during which a unit member is either terminated from active employment<br/>or not on the District’s active payroll for any reason, including, but not<br/>limited to, layoff and voluntary leave of absence for more than thirty (30)<br/>days. Upon the rehiring of any unit member, or upon the recalling of a<br/>unit member from layoff status, the District will resume or initiate dues or<br/>representation fee deductions for such member only upon a valid<br/>dues/representation fee deduction authorization as defined herein.</p>
<p>3.7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obligations of Parties</p>
<p>3.7.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District's Obligations</p>
<p>The District’s sole and exclusive obligations under this Article are<br/>to notify any unit member who has failed to comply with the<br/>provisions of this Section that, as a condition of employment in the<br/>District, such unit member must either become an Association<br/>member, pay a representation fee, either through voluntary or<br/>involuntary deductions, or establish an exempt status and make<br/>payment pursuant to provisions of Section 3.7.7 of this Agreement,<br/>and to make payroll deductions pursuant to Section 3.7.8.1 of this<br/>Agreement. It is the express intention of the parties that the<br/>agency fee obligation outlined herein constitutes a condition of<br/>continued employment and that the parties contemplate utilizing<br/>the remedies provided for in Education Code Section 45061 for<br/>enforcing this Article.</p>
<p>3.7.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association Obligations</p>
<p>The Association shall be responsible for requiring unit members to<br/>fulfill obligations defined herein and to collect any representation<br/>fees which may be due and payable to the Association in<br/>consideration for its services as the exclusive representative of unit<br/>employees.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>3.7.11 Hold Harmless Provision</p>
<p>The Association shall hold the District harmless, and shall fully and<br/>promptly reimburse the District for any legal fees, court costs, or other<br/>litigation expenses incurred in responding to or defending against any<br/>claims against the District or any of its agents, or employees, in<br/>connection with the interpretation, application, administration or<br/>enforcement of any Section in this Agreement pertaining to representation<br/>fee.</p>
<p>3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in cases where it is believed that the immediate safety of students and</p>
<p>adults on campus is at risk, the District shall, prior to any search of a bargaining<br/>unit member’s personal property, notify the bargaining unit member of his/her<br/>right to Association representation prior to the commencement of any such search.<br/>The bargaining unit member must decline Association representation in writing.<br/>No search shall be commenced without the written approval of the bargaining unit<br/>member if the bargaining unit member declines Association representation. No<br/>search shall be commenced without the written approval of the bargaining unit<br/>member and the Association representative if such representation is accepted.</p>
<p>3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of three (3) or more unit members at a school site, the principal will</p>
<p>arrange a meeting within a reasonable period of time to discuss school-related<br/>concerns.</p>

<p>14</p>
<p>procedure. Names of all aggrieved parties shall appear on any documents<br/>related to the settlement of the grievance.</p>
<p>4.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member may at any time present grievances to the District and<br/>have such grievances adjusted without the intervention of the Association,<br/>as long as the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and the adjustment<br/>is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement - provided that the<br/>District shall not agree to the resolution of the grievance until the<br/>Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response. Upon<br/>request of the grievant and concurrence of the Association, the grievant<br/>may be represented at any stage of the grievance procedure by a<br/>representative of the Association.</p>
<p>4.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not represented at levels 1, 2, and 3 by the Association or<br/>its representative, the Association shall have the right to state its views at<br/>all stages of the grievance procedure, and to be present at any hearing<br/>before the Governing Board.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Grievance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference</p>

<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Steps in Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>4.4.1 Level I</p>
<p>Within thirty (30) days of when the grievant knew or should reasonably<br/>have known of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance, the<br/>grievant must present such grievance in writing, on the District Grievance<br/>Form, to the immediate supervisor. This statement shall be a clear,<br/>concise statement of the grievance, the provision(s) of the Agreement<br/>involved, and the specific remedy sought. The supervisor shall<br/>communicate a written decision to the unit member and the Association<br/>within ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does<br/>not respond within the time limits, the grievance is automatically moved to<br/>the next level.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>4.4.2 Level II</p>
<p>4.4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at<br/>Level I, the grievant may (within ten (10) days) appeal the<br/>decision, on the District Grievance Form, to the Superintendent<br/>or designee. Failure to meet the time limit shall constitute an<br/>automatic withdrawal of the grievance and the grievance shall be<br/>deemed resolved.</p>
<p>4.4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall communicate a written<br/>decision to the grievant and the Association within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the<br/>Superintendent or designee may request a personal conference<br/>within the above time limits. If the Superintendent or designee<br/>does not respond within the time limits, the grievance is<br/>automatically moved to the next level.</p>
<p>4.4.3 Level III - Mediation</p>
<p>Mediation prior to arbitration shall be pursued if the grievant and/or the<br/>Association is/are not satisfied with the Superintendent or designee<br/>decision at Level n. A request for mediation must be submitted in writing<br/>to the District within ten (10) days of a written decision being rendered or<br/>should have been rendered at Level II.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) working days of requesting mediation, the Association<br/>shall request that a mutually agreeable mediator from the California State<br/>Mediation Service, or from any other dispute resolution center, be<br/>assigned to assist the parties in the resolution of the grievance.</p>
<p>No later than 30 days following the request for mediation, the mediator<br/>shall meet with the grievant, the Association, and the Superintendent or<br/>designee for the purpose of resolving the grievance. The timeline may be<br/>extended by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>If an agreement is reached, the agreement shall be reduced to writing and<br/>shall be signed and shall constitute a settlement of the grievance.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>4.4.4 Level IV-Arbitration</p>
<p>4.4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the grievant, the Association, and the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee have not resolved the grievance<br/>with the assistance of the mediator within ten (10) working days<br/>from the last meeting held with the mediator, the Association may<br/>at its sole discretion, proceed to arbitration. A grievant who wishes<br/>to have her or his matter heard by an arbitrator, may submit a<br/>request for arbitration to the Association within ten (10) working<br/>days of the last meeting held with the District and the mediator.</p>
<p>If the Association concurs with the grievant’s request for<br/>arbitration, the Association shall, within ten (10) working days<br/>after receipt of the request for arbitration, submit a request in<br/>writing to the Superintendent for arbitration of the dispute, and the<br/>District shall join in the request. Such request must be made within<br/>thirty (30) days of the decision at Level in. Failure to meet the<br/>time limit shall constitute an ultimate withdrawal of the grievance<br/>and the grievance shall be deemed resolved.</p>
<p>4.4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District shall attempt to agree upon an<br/>arbitrator. If no agreement can be reached, the parties shall request<br/>from the American Arbitration Association, a list of seven (7)<br/>names of qualified arbitrators. The District and the Association<br/>shall alternately strike names from the list, with the order of<br/>striking being determined by lot. The last person whose name<br/>remains after the striking procedure shall be the arbitrator.</p>
<p>4.4.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render<br/>a decision on the issue or issues that were submitted to arbitration.<br/>If the parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the<br/>Arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written<br/>grievance and the answers thereto at each level. If either party<br/>raises an issue of arbitrability, such party raising the issue may<br/>request, by written notice to the other party 48 hours in advance of<br/>the hearing, a separate hearing on the issue of arbitrability. Such</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>decision may, upon agreement of the parties, consist of a decision<br/>without written opinion. No hearing on the merits of the case will<br/>be conducted until the issue of arbitrability has been decided.</p>
<p>4.4.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to<br/>make written arguments, the Arbitrator shall submit in writing to<br/>all parties copies of the award.</p>
<p>4.4.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree that the jurisdiction and<br/>authority of the Arbitrator so selected and the opinions he/she<br/>expresses will be confined exclusively to the interpretation of the<br/>express provision or provisions of this Agreement at issue between<br/>the parties. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,<br/>subtract from, alter, amend, or modify any provisions of the<br/>Agreement or impose any limitations or obligations not specifically<br/>provided for under the terms of this Agreement. The Arbitrator<br/>shall be without power or authority to make any decision that<br/>requires the District or the Association to do an act prohibited by<br/>law, or in violation of this Agreement or that involves the exercise<br/>of discretion by the District under the provisions of this Agreement<br/>or applicable law. The decision of the Arbitrator, within the limits<br/>prescribed, shall be final and binding upon the parties to the<br/>dispute, except as provided by law.</p>
<p>4.4.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and the hearing shall be<br/>borne equally by the District and the grievant. All other expenses<br/>shall be borne by the parties incurring them. Unless the parties<br/>mutually agree to share the expenses, the cost of the services and<br/>expenses of the court reporter shall be paid by the party requesting<br/>same.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5: SAFETY AND WORKING CONDITIONS</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall use all reasonable efforts to provide safe working</p>
<p>conditions for all unit members. The District and unit members shall<br/>monitor and correct unsafe conditions, when possible. The District and unit<br/>members will make conscientious efforts to reasonably inform and comply<br/>with relevant District safety practices and procedures.</p>
<p>5 .2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will not be required to perform tasks that endanger their own</p>
<p>health and safety or the health and safety of others. Unit members are<br/>encouraged to report and resolve unsafe conditions with their immediate<br/>supervisor. If the issue is not resolved to the satisfaction of the unit member,<br/>the unit member shall notify his/her immediate supervisor in writing, with a<br/>copy to the Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services, concerning<br/>conditions which, in his/her opinion, would directly affect the physical<br/>welfare of students and/or themselves. The supervisor, together with the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services or designee, will<br/>investigate any such reported conditions and advise the unit member(s) in<br/>writing of their findings and any corrective action which will be taken. The<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Administrative Services or designee shall provide a<br/>status report to the unit member no later than five (5) working days from the<br/>date of notification by the unit member.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All accidents to unit members shall be reported immediately to the</p>
<p>principal or his/her designee. The principal shall review the cause and<br/>work for the elimination of said cause.</p>
<p>5 .4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide to unit members where reasonably possible those</p>
<p>classroom and workroom materials and facilities reasonably necessary to<br/>perform their duties.</p>

<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assault</p>
<p>5.6.1 The District shall inform the teacher of every student who has caused</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>or who has attempted to cause serious bodily injury, based on written<br/>records maintained by the District or received from law enforcement<br/>agencies, as provided in Section 49079 of the Education Code. Unit<br/>members may use reasonable force under circumstances which require<br/>that they defend themselves or students against an assault - provided,<br/>however, that such force does not exceed that which is needed to repel<br/>or protect from bodily injury, and provided further, that the unit<br/>member report any such incident to the immediate supervisor within a<br/>24-hour period. The above provision shall not be read as a requirement<br/>that unit members must place themselves in danger of serious bodily<br/>injury in order to protect another employee or student from an assault.</p>
<p>5.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall notify their principals immediately in all cases of<br/>assault suffered by them in connection with their employment. The<br/>principal shall investigate the assault, obtain information from all<br/>sources, and upon request, accompany the unit member in court<br/>appearances.</p>
<p>5.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are assaulted may file a report or complaint with<br/>the local police department.</p>
<p>5.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who has been the victim of a physical attack or the<br/>threat of a physical attack which can be reasonably carried out, shall,<br/>upon request, be relieved of all duty for the remainder of the day<br/>without loss of pay or leave time.</p>
<p>5.7 Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed as waiving the statutory rights<br/>of a teacher to suspend a student.</p>
<p>20</p>

<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall take all reasonable steps to assure an adequate number of work<br/>stations and/or adequate work space for the safe conduct of instruction of the<br/>number of students assigned to each particular class.</p>
<p>21</p><h6>ARTICLE 7: HOURS AND ASSIGNMENTS</h6>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the school year for students shall be determined by the District, in<br/>accordance with law, and shall be no less than 180 student days. This provision<br/>does not prevent the District from scheduling non-student days (days on which<br/>students do not attend school but which are counted as student attendance days for<br/>apportionment purposes), as permitted by the Education Code. The District may<br/>extend the school year for students to the extent such extension is funded by the<br/>State and the District pays unit members at their daily rate for any such extension.<br/>The work year for bargaining unit members shall be 183 work days except for the<br/>following: Psychologists 191 days; Educational Advisors and Counselors 193<br/>days; Librarians 188 days.</p>

<p>Unit members shall perform supervisory/student control tasks as assigned by the<br/>Principal or his/her designee during emergencies. The Association agrees that the<br/>supervision of pupils entails pupil behavior control anywhere on the school<br/>campus or anywhere that the classroom exists as a function of field trips.</p>
<p>Adjunct Duties</p>
<p>All certificated unit members are expected to participate in various adjunct duties<br/>each year. Adjunct duties are those which involve additional time outside the<br/>work day to improve the overall school experience of the students.</p>
<p>On days when unit members are required to return for Open House and/or<br/>Back-to-School Night, the pupil instructional day shall end no later than<br/>12:45 PM. The remainder of the workday shall be reserved for individual<br/>preparation.</p>

<p>25</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8: TRANSFERS AND REASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “transfer” refers to the movement of a unit member from one work site to<br/>another. A “reassignment” is a change from primary grades (K-3) to upper grades<br/>(4-5) or vice versa, from one middle or high school department to another<br/>department in which the unit member is not then assigned, or from one job<br/>classification to another (such as teacher to educational advisor). Initial<br/>assignments are within the District’s sole discretion. A transfer or reassignment<br/>may be unit member initiated (“voluntary”) or District initiated (“involuntary”).<br/>Involuntary transfers and reassignments shall be accomplished at the discretion of<br/>the District as set forth in this Article.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Reassignments</p>
<p>8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting of Vacancies</p>
<p>A “vacancy” is any certificated position in the bargaining unit that does<br/>not have a unit member assigned to it and is an opening which the District<br/>has determined to fill. The District shall post each vacancy prior to<br/>holding any formal interviews with individuals outside the unit for that<br/>vacancy.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall deliver to the Association and post in all school<br/>buildings and work sites a list of all vacancies that occur during the work<br/>year and that are assured to occur for the following work year.</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each posting shall contain the following information:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site location(s) of the vacancy</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifications, which shall include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level or subject matter experience</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credential requirements</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service requirements</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special qualifications</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstration of satisfactory teaching experience as<br/>evidenced by evaluations</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job description, if available, and/or typical responsibilities</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>8.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All postings shall include the closing date for filing. The closing day for<br/>current employees shall be no less than five (5) business days after posting<br/>unless the District can demonstrate an unanticipated need to fill the<br/>vacancy sooner. A business day is a day when the District Office is open<br/>for service.</p>
<p>8.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall inform all unit members who will be transferred or<br/>reassigned for the ensuing school year no later than May 30, where<br/>possible. Should additional transfers and/or reassignments become<br/>necessary after that date, the District shall notify affected unit members as<br/>soon as possible.</p>
<p>8.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for a voluntary transfer or reassignment shall be maintained in<br/>an “active” file for twelve (12) months following receipt of the request and<br/>for that twelve (12) month period the District shall consider the request in<br/>connection with subsequent posted vacancies for positions comparable<br/>(i.e., school, grade and/or subject matter) to those listed in the request for<br/>transfer or reassignment. The District shall notify unit members in the<br/>“active file” by e-mail (or by mail on written request with a self addressed<br/>stamped envelope provided) of any posted openings which may arise<br/>during the summer recess. Failure to so notify a unit member shall not<br/>form the basis for a grievance and shall not invalidate a related transfer or<br/>reassignment.</p>
<p>8.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who desire to transfer or be reassigned shall file an application<br/>with his/her site administrator and the Assistant Superintendent or<br/>Director of Human Resources. Such statement shall include the school or<br/>schools and grade level and/or subject matter to which he/she desires to be<br/>transferred or reassigned in order of preference.</p>
<p>8.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application forms for voluntary transfer and/or reassignment shall be<br/>made available at the District Office or through the site administrator upon<br/>request.</p>
<p>8.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In filling posted vacancies, the District shall consider unit members from<br/>the “active” file, other requests for voluntary transfer, unit members</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>returning to work from leaves of absence or layoff status and outside<br/>applicants. When the District determines that the qualifications of<br/>competing applicants for the same position are equal, the District shall<br/>take District seniority into account (as determined by the first date of paid<br/>service in a probationary position, pursuant to the provisions of the<br/>California Education Code).</p>
<p>8.2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member’s request for a voluntary transfer is denied, the unit<br/>member, upon request, shall be granted a meeting with the administrator<br/>who denied the request to discuss the reasons for the denial.</p>
<p>8.2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a school previously closed is reopened or a new school is<br/>opened, the District shall use the following criteria in fulfilling the vacant<br/>positions at the new or reopened school (with a goal of staffing the new or<br/>reopened school on a voluntary basis):</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recent grade range experience</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;balanced staffing</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team considerations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;successful collegial relationships</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credential qualifications</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seniority (used as a tie breaker in the event that all other<br/>qualifications are equal)</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers and Reassignments</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers or reassignments shall not be made outside the major<br/>or minor fields of study and/or the areas of qualification as established by<br/>the unit member’s credential(s) unless by mutual consent.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be transferred or reassigned for arbitrary or punitive<br/>reasons.</p>
<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is to be involuntarily transferred or reassigned, the<br/>unit member being transferred or reassigned shall be provided, upon<br/>request, up to two (2) days of compensatory time or two (2) days of pay at<br/>the daily substitute rate for the personal time required to move, prepare<br/>and organize his/her classroom environment and materials. The District</p>
<p>shall provide assistance in moving boxed material whenever a unit<br/>member is involuntarily transferred or reassigned.</p>
<p>8.3.3.1 A Unit member shall not be involuntarily reassigned</p>
<p>and/or transferred more than once within a two (2) year<br/>period.</p>
<p>8.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers and/or involuntary reassignments may be initiated by<br/>District and/or site-level management based upon good and sufficient<br/>cause relating to the educational needs of the District, including the need<br/>for compliance with the No Child Left Behind Act (“NCLB”) and<br/>Bilingual, Crosscultural, Language and Academic Development<br/>(“BCLAD”) certificate requirements. In the event of such transfer or<br/>reassignment, the employee(s) shall be advised of the reasons thereof<br/>through a personal conference with the appropriate administrator five (5)<br/>days prior to the transfer or reassignment, unless said transfer or<br/>reassignment occurs within the first month of school or in case of an<br/>emergency. Teachers to be involuntarily transferred or reassigned shall<br/>have the right to indicate duty preferences from a list of all available<br/>positions for which they are qualified by virtue of credential and training,<br/>and the administrator(s) responsible for the transfer or reassignment shall<br/>make every effort to honor these preferences.</p>
<p>8.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particular worksite is to be closed, unit members at that site shall be<br/>accorded first consideration for filling any new or vacant positions at the<br/>site(s) to which the students at the closing site are being placed.</p>
<p>8.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall consider the following criteria in selecting the unit<br/>member to be involuntarily transferred:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level and/or subject&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;area experience;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate credentials;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ability to perform responsibilities of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vacant position;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special qualifications for the vacant position, including, but not<br/>limited to adjunct duty skills;</p>

<p>Assessment - The act of determining the degree or amount of student<br/>progress and/or unit member performance as a component of the evaluation<br/>process. Course Objectives - Statements which provide the basic framework<br/>for each course and indicate what the students are expected to learn as a result<br/>of taking the course.</p>
<p>Curricular Adherence - Course goals and objectives are consistent with the scope<br/>and sequence of the District approved curriculum.</p>
<p>Evaluatee - A unit member being evaluated.</p>
<p>Evaluator - The prime evaluator shall be appointed by the principal. If the<br/>evaluatee does not agree with the appointment, he/she may request another<br/>evaluator. If no agreement can be reached, the principal shall be the prime<br/>evaluator.</p>
<p>Final Evaluation - An evaluation which is the synthesis of all the data collected<br/>during the evaluation period.</p>
<p>Instructional Strategies - A variety of content delivery methods used by teachers<br/>to determine the appropriate match between the content and the learner.</p>
<p>Pertinent Factors - The District and the Association acknowledge that external<br/>conditions can affect a unit member’s performance and his or her ability to meet</p>
<p>objectives.</p>
<p>Pupil Progress - The specific progress made by a student during a given<br/>instructional period as revealed by periodic assessment and in comparison with<br/>base line data.</p>
<p>Rating Scale</p>

<p>10.1</p>
<p>10.2</p>
<p>10.3</p>
<p>10.4</p>
<p>10.5</p>
<p>No negative and/or unsatisfactory evaluation, assignment, discipline, dismissal, or<br/>other adverse action shall be predicated solely upon uninvestigated complaints or<br/>information of a derogatory or critical nature which has been received by the<br/>District from pupils, parents, non-supervisory District employees, public agencies,<br/>and/or the public.</p>
<p>A complaint against a unit member made to any administrator by a<br/>parent/guardian, community member, student, or non-administrative/non-<br/>supervisory employee of the District shall be reported in writing to the unit<br/>member within five (5) working days, following receipt of the complaint, if it is to<br/>be investigated further.</p>
<p>At the request of the unit member, the administrator shall attempt to schedule a<br/>meeting between the member and the complainant. At the request of the unit<br/>member, an Association representative may be present at the meeting. If the<br/>complainant refuses to attend the meeting, such refusal shall be a factor<br/>considered in judging the eventual credibility of the complaint.</p>
<p>Whether or not a meeting takes place, if the complaint has not been resolved, the<br/>complaint shall be reduced to writing and signed by the complainant. If the<br/>complainant refuses to sign the complaint, such refusal shall be a factor<br/>considered in judging the eventual credibility of the complaint.</p>
<p>10.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written complaint must include the name of the unit member(s)<br/>involved, if known, and a brief actual summary of the complaint,<br/>including approximate time(s), date(s), place(s) and names of any<br/>persons who might have information about the complaint.</p>
<p>10.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator shall investigate the written complaint and, where<br/>appropriate, attempt to resolve it. The administrator shall reduce his/her<br/>findings to writing and provide a copy to the affected unit member(s).</p>
<p>A written complaint filed against a unit member may be placed in his/her<br/>personnel file, attached to the administrator’s findings, only after the procedures<br/>set forth in this article have been followed. In such event, the unit member shall<br/>be given an opportunity to review the complaint and prepare a rebuttal for</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>10.6</p>
<p>10.7</p>
<p>attachment to the complaint. In no event shall a complaint be placed in a<br/>personnel file without identification of the complainant. If the unit member<br/>believes the complaint placed in the file is false, a grievance may be initiated to<br/>determine the validity of such complaint and related administrator’s findings.<br/>Complaints which are withdrawn or shown to be unsubstantiated in the course of<br/>an administrative investigation shall not be maintained in the unit member’s<br/>personnel file nor utilized as part of any evaluation, assignment decision,<br/>disciplinary action, or dismissal action against the unit member.</p>
<p>All information or proceedings regarding any complaint shall be kept confidential<br/>by the site administrator and the District to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11: LEAVES</p>
<p>11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits</p>
<p>The benefits which are expressly provided by this Article are the sole leave<br/>benefits which are a part of this Agreement. It is agreed that nothing in this<br/>Article constitutes a waiver of any other statutory or regulatory leave rights that<br/>may be enjoyed by unit members outside this Agreement.</p>

<p>11.2.1</p></td><td>
<p>A ten-month unit member is entitled to ten (10) days sick leave<br/>with full pay for each regular school year for absences caused by<br/>illness or disability. Employees employed on a regular basis shall<br/>accumulate one (1) day’s leave of absence for illness or disability<br/>for each month of employment, not to exceed twelve (12) days per<br/>year. Unit members who work less than full-time shall be entitled<br/>to that portion of the ten (10) days leave as the number of hours per<br/>week scheduled duty relates to the number of hours for a full-time<br/>unit member in a comparable position. A K-5 unit member who is<br/>absent for one-half day or less, as defined in Article 7 herein, shall<br/>have deducted one-half day from the accumulated leave. A 6-12<br/>unit member who is absent for less than a full day, shall have the<br/>appropriate number of periods deducted from the accumulated<br/>leave.</p></td></tr>

<p>applied to a full time (4 hours per day), or part time (2 hours per<br/>day), teaching assignment, means that an employee is entitled to<br/>use accumulated sick time/personal necessity leave in order to miss<br/>a maximum of 2 days of teaching during a summer session (only 1<br/>of which may be personal necessity leave). Use of sick time or<br/>personal necessity leave will be deducted based on the hours used,<br/>4 hours used equals 80% of a regular teaching day, 2 hours used<br/>equals 40% of a regular day. Absence beyond the 2 day maximum<br/>cannot be covered by any other accumulated time and results in<br/>loss of pay for the days missed.</p>
<p>11.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October of each year the District will provide each unit member<br/>with a statement of accrued sick leave as of August 31<sup>st</sup> and the<br/>entitlement for the current year. If a unit member does not utilize<br/>the full amount of leave as authorized above in any school year,<br/>the amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>11.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belief of abuse of sick leave, and upon request by</p>
<p>District management, a unit member shall be required to present a<br/>certificate signed by the unit member verifying the actual illness or<br/>injury, or present a certificate signed by a medical authority. If the<br/>illness or injury exceeds three (3) consecutive days, the District<br/>may require, at District’s expense, a certified medical specialist to<br/>examine the unit member and make all necessary inquiries in order<br/>to be fully informed as to the nature and severity of the illness or<br/>injury, and to report such finding to the Superintendent or<br/>designee. If the report concludes that the absence is not due to<br/>personal illness or injury, or that the illness is not sufficiently<br/>severe to warrant continued absence then the Superintendent or<br/>designee, after notice to the unit member, may refuse to grant such</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>leave. If requested by the District management, a unit member<br/>shall not return to work until a medical doctor’s authorization is<br/>submitted at District’s expense to return to work.</p>
<p>11.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are expected to notify the designated school person<br/>of their intent to be absent, whenever practicable, by 7:00 a.m.<br/>Repeated failure to provide adequate notice may be grounds for<br/>denial of leave with pay or other disciplinary action. A unit<br/>member who is absent shall make a reasonable attempt to notify<br/>the District prior to 3:00 p.m. of the date of the absence if he/she is<br/>not returning the following workday.</p>
<p>11.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may be required to have a medical or psychiatric<br/>examination(s) by District approved physician(s). Such<br/>examination(s) will be at District expense.</p>
<p>11.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be given credit for all unused leave of absence for</p>
<p>illness or injury accrued while serving in another California school<br/>district as prescribed in Education Code Section 44979. Such<br/>unused leave of absence for illness or injury will be credited to the<br/>paid employee only upon receipt of official notice from the<br/>California school district of prior employment. Such credit for<br/>unused leave of absence for illness or injury will be given only<br/>employees who have been employed by a California school district<br/>in the year prior to the acceptance of employment in the District.<br/>When an employee terminates employment after one year or<br/>longer with the District and accepts employment with another<br/>California school district in the succeeding year, the unused leave<br/>of absence for illness or injury shall be computed and forwarded to<br/>the new district of employment upon request.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave Donation Plan</p>
<p>11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A catastrophic injury or illness shall be defined as any injury or</p>
<p>illness which for a period of not less than seventy (70) consecutive<br/>days, has caused an employee to be incapacitated from the</p>
<p>11.3.2</p>
<p>11.3.3</p>
<p>11.3.4</p>
<p>performance of duty as an employee of the District, or is<br/>reasonably certain to result in such incapacity for seventy (70)<br/>consecutive days, based upon competent medical evidence.<br/>Catastrophic injury or illness shall also include an illness or injury<br/>that incapacitates a member of the employee’s family, which<br/>incapacity requires the employee to take time off from work for a<br/>period of seventy consecutive days, and taking extended time off<br/>from work creates a financial hardship for the employee.</p>
<p>An employee who qualifies for catastrophic injury or illness leave<br/>may not draw upon the leave bank until exhaustion of all paid<br/>illness and injury leave including the payments provided by<br/>Section 11.2 above. Thereafter, any donated leave from the leave<br/>bank shall be paid concurrently with substitute-differential pay,<br/>provided that the total daily compensation paid to the donee<br/>employee shall not exceed the donee employee’s daily rate of pay<br/>were he/she actively employed. No employee who qualifies for a<br/>donation of leave from the leave bank based on an injury or illness<br/>of his/her family shall be authorized to receive substitute<br/>differential pay.</p>
<p>The employee who receives leave from the bank shall furnish all<br/>requested medical information deemed necessary by the District to<br/>determine the employee’s eligibility to receive donated leave under<br/>this Section 11.3. Upon request by the District, the employee shall<br/>execute an authorization for the release of medical information.</p>
<p>The District shall be entitled to obtain an independent medical<br/>evaluation to determine an employee’s right to receive leave from<br/>the leave bank.</p>
<p>Unit members may request utilization of Catastrophic<br/>Leave by completing a Catastrophic Leave request form<br/>from the Human Resources Office. The employee shall<br/>have exhausted all accrued paid leave. An employee</p>
<p>may request Catastrophic Leave only once during a year.</p>
<p>Leaves, if granted, shall be for up to the balance of the<br/>current school year. Days currently accrued in the District<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall first be exhausted for<br/>employees who are granted leave. Thereafter, unit<br/>members may donate a portion of their sick leave to<br/>another employee who has run out of accrued leave and<br/>who has a medical emergency. These donations may be<br/>made on an “as needed” basis. The District will notify unit<br/>members of an individual need by way of inter-office<br/>memorandum. Unit members desiring to donate such sick<br/>leave will notify Human Resources in writing as to the<br/>number of days, in full day increments, of sick leave they<br/>wish to donate.</p>
<p>11.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wishes to donate sick leave shall execute an</p>
<p>authorization for the donation of the sick leave and an assignment<br/>of the leave to the leave bank.</p>
<p>11.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;submitted a request to donate sick leave,</p>
<p>and an employee who requests and receives leave from the leave<br/>bank, shall each execute an agreement satisfactory to the District.<br/>The agreement will confirm the understanding of each that the<br/>donation of sick leave is voluntary. The agreement will also<br/>provide that each employee agrees to indemnify and hold the<br/>District harmless from any claims, demands, or causes of action<br/>related to the donation.</p>
<p>11.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disapprove&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave</p>
<p>under this Section. No action taken by the District under this<br/>Section shall be subject to the grievance procedure of this<br/>Agreement. The District and the Association, however, agree to<br/>establish a catastrophic leave advisory review panel. The panel<br/>shall be composed of five (5) members, two of whom are</p>
<p>42</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<p>11.3.8</p></td><td>
<p>appointed by the District and three (3) of whom are appointed by<br/>the Association. An employee dissatisfied with any action taken or<br/>decision made by the District, concerning the catastrophic leave<br/>plan herein provided, may submit a request to the panel to review<br/>such action or decision. No request for review shall be considered<br/>by the panel unless the request for review is submitted to the<br/>Human Resources Department not later than ten (10) days after the<br/>action or decision in question. The panel shall review timely<br/>matters which are submitted to it, without conducting a formal<br/>hearing. The panel shall prepare a written final decision regarding<br/>the matters submitted to it.</p>
<p>If any provision of this Section 11.3 is held to be unlawful, then<br/>this entire Section shall be null and void. This Section supersedes<br/>any obligations of the parties under Education Code Section<br/>44043.5.9</p></td></tr>

A written statement from a medical doctor<br/>or health department official will be required in order to qualify for salary<br/>maintenance under this Section. Quarantine Leave pay shall be paid only when<br/>unit members are normally required to be on duty.</p>
<p>11.18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Care Leave</p>
<p>An unpaid Family Care and Medical Leave/Absence shall be granted, to the<br/>extent of and subject to the restrictions as set forth below, to an employee who has<br/>been employed for at least 12 months and who has served for 130 workdays<br/>during the 12 months immediately preceding the effective date of the leave. The<br/>Family Care and Medical Leave/Absence may be granted for reason of the birth<br/>of a child of the employee, the placement of a child with an employee in<br/>connection with the adoption or foster care of the child by the employee, the<br/>serious health condition of a child of an employee, the employee’s own serious<br/>health condition, or the care of a parent or spouse who has serious health<br/>condition.</p>
<p>Definitions: For purposes of this leave, the following definitions<br/>shall apply:</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>11.18.1</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Child” means a biological, adopted or foster child; a<br/>stepchild; a legal ward; the child of a cohabitant who is the<br/>equivalent of a spouse; or a child of a person standing “in<br/>loco parentis,” such child being either under 18 years of<br/>age or an adult dependent who is incapable of self care due<br/>to a mental or physical disability.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Spouse” means a husband or wife.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Parent” means a biological, foster, or adoptive parent; a<br/>person who stood “in loco parentis” to the employee when<br/>the employee was a child; a stepparent; or legal guardian;<br/>and does not include a parent-in-law.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Serious health condition” means an illness, injury,<br/>impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves<br/>either in-patient care in a hospital, hospice or residential<br/>health care facility, or continuing treatment or supervision<br/>by a health care provider.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Health care provider” means an individual holding either a<br/>physician’s and surgeon’s certificate or an osteopathic<br/>physician’s and surgeon’s certificate issued pursuant to<br/>Article 4, Chapter 5 of Division 2 of the California<br/>Business and Professional Code, who directly treats or<br/>supervises the treatment of the serious health condition, or<br/>any other individual duly licensed to practice medicine in<br/>another state or jurisdiction or by any other person<br/>determined by the Secretary of Labor to be capable of<br/>providing health care services. The definition includes<br/>podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists,<br/>chiropractors (limited in scope), nurse practitioners, nurse<br/>midwives, and certain Christian Science practitioners.</p>
<p>11.18.2 Length of Leave: The leave, together with any renewal thereof,</p>
<p>shall not exceed the number of days equivalent to a total of 12</p>
<p>normally scheduled work weeks in a fiscal year. However, leave<br/>may be taken intermittently in one or more periods. In addition,<br/>the following provisions govern the length of the leave:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who takes leave for the birth, adoption or<br/>placement for foster care of a child will be allowed to take<br/>leave of at least one hour within one year of the birth, adoption<br/>or placement for foster care of the child.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who takes leave for health care provider certified<br/>recurring medical treatment or supervision to care for a<br/>seriously ill family member or because of the employee’s own<br/>serious health condition, will be allowed to take leave of at<br/>least one hour.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any leave an employee takes for the reasons specified in<br/>Section 11.18 above will be counted against the employee’s<br/>annual leave entitlements under the federal Family and Medical<br/>Leave Act of 1993 and the California Family Rights Act of<br/>1991 as amended. This leave runs concurrently with any other<br/>leave the District offers for which the employee is qualified,<br/>except that family care and medical leave granted for the birth<br/>or adoption of a child or placement of a child for foster care<br/>must be concluded within 12 months of that birth or adoption<br/>or placement for foster care.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical<br/>conditions under Subdivision 11.9 of this Article is separate<br/>and apart from the provisions of Family Care and Medical<br/>Leave/Absence herein. Employees are entitled to the leave<br/>allowed under Section 11.9 and, in addition, up to the full 12<br/>work weeks of family care leave.</p>
<p>11.18.3 Approval: Family Care and Medical Leave/Absences of 20</p>
<p>consecutive workdays or less can be granted by the immediate<br/>administrator. Leave of more than 20 consecutive workdays can</p>

<p>11.18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification and Scheduling: If the need for the Family Care and<br/>Medical Leave/Absence is foreseeable more than 30 calendar days<br/>prior to the employee’s need for leave, the employee shall give at<br/>least 30 days notice. If less than 30 days, the employee must<br/>provide the immediate supervisor with as much advance notice as<br/>possible but, at the least, within one or two days of learning of the<br/>need for the leave, or as soon as practicable, whichever is earlier.<br/>These advance notice requirements shall not be applicable in the<br/>event of unforeseeable circumstances or emergencies. Whenever<br/>possible, if the need for leave is foreseeable due to a planned<br/>medical treatment or supervision, the employee must make a<br/>reasonable effort, subject to the approval of the health care<br/>provider, to schedule the treatment or supervision to avoid<br/>disruption to the operation of the District’s education program.</p>
<p>11.18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Certification - Family: For leaves/absences to care for a<br/>child, spouse or parent, as defined in 11.8.2, who has a serious<br/>health condition, the employee must submit to the immediate<br/>administrator or, if applying for a formal leave must attach to the<br/>leave application, certification from the health care provider which<br/>includes (1) the date if known, (2) the probable duration of the<br/>condition, (3) an estimate of the time that the health care provider<br/>believes the employee needs to care for the individual, and (4) a<br/>statement that the serious health condition warrants the<br/>participation of the employee to provide care.</p>
<p>11.18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Certification - Employee: If the leave is for the serious<br/>health condition of the employee, the employee must submit to the<br/>immediate administrator and/or, if applying for a formal leave<br/>must attach to the leave application, certification as specified in (1)<br/>and (2) of 11.8.5 above, plus a statement that, due to the serious</p>
<p>health condition, the employee is unable to perform one or more of<br/>the essential functions of the employee’s position. After such<br/>certification, the following procedures are available:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of leave due to the serious health condition of the<br/>employee, the District reserves the right to require, at its own<br/>expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a second or<br/>even third health care provider designated by the District but<br/>not employed on a regular basis by the District. The second<br/>health care provider, if required, shall be selected by the<br/>District. A third health care provider can be requested by the<br/>employee or the District if the second opinion differs from the<br/>first opinion.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method that shall be used to choose the third health care<br/>provider is as follows: The District and employee shall each<br/>choose a health care provider. The two health care providers<br/>will choose the third health care provider, whose opinion shall<br/>be final and binding.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional leave beyond that provided in the certification is<br/>required, the employee must submit recertification by the<br/>health care provider and be eligible for additional requested<br/>leave.</p>
<p>11.18.7 Restrictions: In the event that spouses who are both District</p>
<p>employees each wish to take Family Care Leave/Absence for the<br/>birth of their child, or placement for adoption, or foster care<br/>placement of a child during the same time period, the combined<br/>total amount of leave that will be granted such employees will be<br/>12 work weeks during a fiscal year. These employees will still be<br/>eligible to take the remainder of their individual 12 week allotment<br/>for family care leave for a purpose other than the birth, placement<br/>for adoption, or foster care of a child.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>11.18.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Benefits: The Family Care and Medical</p>
<p>Leave/Absence shall be an unpaid leave and for all purposes<br/>treated comparably to other unpaid leaves except that the District<br/>will continue to provide the health and welfare benefits as provided<br/>in Article 17 during the Family Care Leave/Absence to an<br/>employee who is otherwise eligible for such benefits. However, an<br/>employee who does not return from such leave or who works less<br/>than 30 days after returning from the leave will be required to<br/>reimburse the District for the cost of the benefits package unless<br/>the reason the employee does not return to work is due to (1) the<br/>continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that<br/>would entitle the employee to FMLA Leave (either affecting the<br/>employee or an immediate family member) or (2) retirement, or (3)<br/>other circumstances beyond the control of the employee. The<br/>District, however, will not provide such health benefits for an<br/>employee for any leave period beyond twelve weeks unless these<br/>benefits are provided by other provisions of this Agreement, such<br/>as paid illness leave. For example, if an employee combines<br/>pregnancy leave with a family care leave, the employee will only<br/>be entitled to continued health benefits for the first twelve weeks<br/>of leave unless the employee continues on paid illness leave.</p>
<p>An employee who takes leave for the employee’s own serious<br/>health condition which prevents the employee from performing<br/>one or more of the essential functions of the employee’s position<br/>and who has accumulated illness days may elect, or the District<br/>may require the employee to utilize paid illness days for the leave.</p>
<p>11.18.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority: The period of the Family Care Medical Leave/Absence<br/>shall not be considered a break in service, and the employee’s<br/>seniority date shall not be affected by the time spent on leave.</p>
<p>11.18.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return Rights: An employee returning from a Family Care and<br/>Medical Leave/Absence shall be returned to the same or</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>comparable position from which on leave and the same location<br/>from which the leave was taken, except that the employee may be<br/>transferred if such a transfer would have been made had the<br/>employee been on duty.</p>
<p>11.19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave</p>
<p>11.19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intention of the District and Association is that jury</p>
<p>service be encouraged, but also limited, as far as practical, to<br/>periods of time when the continuity of instruction will not be<br/>adversely affected. An employee summoned to jury service in<br/>federal or state court shall notify his/her immediate administrator<br/>of that summons. At the employee’s request, the District and the<br/>employee shall jointly seek deferral of the obligation so that it can<br/>be performed on the employee’s non-work time. If the jury service<br/>unavoidably runs into the employee’s work time, a paid leave shall<br/>be granted to the employee of up to 10 (ten) working days.</p>
<p>11.19.1.1 Unit members who elect to voluntarily defer their</p>
<p>jury service to non-required service days (i.e.<br/>summer, winter, mid-winter or spring breaks) shall<br/>be compensated by an amount equal to the District’s<br/>daily substitute teacher rate of pay for each day of<br/>served jury duty, up to a maximum of ten (10) days.<br/>To qualify for compensation, the unit member must<br/>provide written documentation to the District<br/>showing the original jury summons date and the<br/>actual date(s) of jury duty served.</p>
<p>11.19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to receive base salary during leave for jury duty during<br/>work-time, the unit member must take the following steps:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notify the principal or other supervising administrator.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain a form completed by an officer of the court to verify<br/>required appearance(s).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit the completed form to the supervising administrator.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>11.20</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimburse the District for any amount received for jury<br/>service, less mileage.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report back to school on any day that he/she is not required to<br/>be available for jury duty. Failure to do so may cause the unit<br/>member’s salary to be reduced by that or those days.</p>
<p>Job Share Leave</p>
<p>A shared contract consists of two bargaining unit members<br/>splitting a full-time assignment to include, but not limited to,<br/>division of days, segmenting days of a school week, and/or<br/>semester of a school year in order that the assignment might be<br/>shared by two unit members.</p>
<p>11.20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members requesting a job sharing assignment must be<br/>bargaining unit members at the time of the job sharing request.</p>
<p>11.20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members interested in job sharing shall submit their written<br/>job sharing proposal to their principal no later than April 1 for the<br/>following school year. Exceptions to this date may be mutually<br/>agreed upon by unit members and the Assistant Superintendent.<br/>Unit members will be informed in writing as to whether their<br/>proposal has been approved no later than May 1. If a request is<br/>denied, the unit member shall be notified in writing of the specific<br/>reasons for the denial. A job share request shall not be denied for<br/>any arbitrary or capricious reason(s).</p>
<p>11.20.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written proposal shall include:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner in which the position will be shared.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification that the unit members’ professional<br/>philosophies are mutually acceptable and consistent.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assurance that curricular and instructional strengths, or<br/>other relevant strengths, of both teachers will be used to the<br/>best advantage of their students.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific plan that outlines tasks, schedules, curricular<br/>program, report cards, conferences and testing.</p>

<p>Parent Conferences, mandatory staff development day(s),<br/>mandatory professional development activities, and the last<br/>day of school.</p>
<p>The job-sharing plan shall last for at least one (1) school<br/>year unless there is an agreement among the principal and<br/>unit members involved. Job sharing teams wishing to<br/>renew a shared job shall make annual application to their<br/>site principal. There shall be an annual review and<br/>evaluation of the shared assignment by the principal and<br/>unit members involved.</p>
<p>Each unit member who participates in a job-sharing program in<br/>any year will be granted a partial leave of absence without pay for<br/>that year.</p>
<p>The salary and benefits, including sick leave, accorded a part-time<br/>unit member shall be a proportional amount of the salary and<br/>benefits which he/she would have earned as a full-time unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>If unit members sharing a full-time assignment are employed for<br/>one semester only, evaluation procedures and timelines will be<br/>adjusted so that the evaluation process will be completed within<br/>the semester worked.</p>
<p>Unit members with shared assignments will retain their original<br/>date of hire on the District seniority list.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>11.20.11 When a job share arrangement terminates, the two unit members<br/>may agree, with the approval of the principal, that one of them will<br/>assume the assignment that they have been job sharing and that the<br/>other may take a voluntary transfer/reassignment selected from a<br/>list of openings within the District. Should the two unit members<br/>fail to reach agreement, the unit member with the greatest seniority<br/>in the District will choose as to whether he/she will assume the<br/>class assignment they have been sharing, or take a<br/>transfer/reassignment selected from a list of openings within the<br/>District. In either case, the unit member taking the<br/>transfer/reassignment shall have no privileges or benefits, over any<br/>other unit member, greater than those obtained through the<br/>provisions of Article 8: Transfers and Reassignments.</p>

<p>justifies continuance of the class being taught.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assigned to District summer school according</p>
