<p>PREAMBLE</p>
<p>This is an Agreement made and entered into this first day of July, 2013, by and between<br/>the Redding Elementary School District (&quot;District&quot;) and the Redding Teachers' Association,<br/>CTA/NEA (&quot;Association&quot;).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION</p>
<p>The Board recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative of all certificated<br/>employees designated in the unit as recognized by the Redding Elementary School District<br/>Board of Trustees; excluding those Board-designated management, confidential, and<br/>supervisory employees as defined by the Educational Employment Relations Act.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2 - DISTRICT RIGHTS</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the District retains all of its power and authority to<br/>direct, manage, and control to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of the District powers, rights, authority, duties, responsibilities, and the<br/>adoption of policies shall be limited by the specific and express terms of this<br/>Agreement, and then only to the extent such specific and express terms are in<br/>conformance with law.</p>
<p>2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article shall be subject to the grievance procedure for the sole purpose of<br/>determining whether the District acted within the discretionary powers described in<br/>this article. <sup>8</sup></p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3 - ASSOCIATION RIGHTS</p>
<p>3.1 Use of Bulletin Board and Mail Service</p>
<p>3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to post notices of activities and<br/>matters of Association concern on District bulletin boards. One such<br/>bulletin board shall be provided in each school building in an area that is<br/>frequented by teachers. The Association may use the intradistrict<br/>communication services for communicating with teachers, consistent<br/>with District policies.</p>
<p>3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association President, or designee, may after the student day and<br/>during the teacher day, meet members of the unit at their school site.<br/>The designee shall check with the local site administrator to avoid<br/>conflicts with the administrator's prior planned activities.</p>
<p>3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide the Association with the names of teachers<br/>appointed to District-wide committees.</p>
<p>3.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RTA will select and provide two members to sit on the MAA Advisory<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>3.2 Association Leave</p>
<p>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association officers and official Association representatives shall be<br/>granted a maximum of twelve (12) paid leave days annually for the<br/>conduct of the Association's affairs.</p>
<p>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association President shall notify the Superintendent two (2) school<br/>days prior to utilizing such leave. In the event of unforeseen<br/>circumstances, the Association President and the Superintendent may<br/>agree to waive this requirement.</p>
<p>3.3 Dues Deduction and Representation Fee</p>
<p>3.3.1 Dues Deductions</p>
<p>Any teacher who is a member of the Association, or who has applied for<br/>membership, may sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing<br/>deduction of unified membership dues, initiation fees and general<br/>assessments in the Association. Pursuant to such authorization, the District<br/>shall deduct one-tenth (1/1 Oth) of such dues from the regular salary check of<br/>the bargaining unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for<br/>bargaining unit members who sign such authorization after the<br/>commencement of the school year shall be appropriately prorated to<br/>complete payments by the end of the school year <sup>9</sup></p>
<p>9</p>
<p>3.3.2 Employee Rights</p>
<p>3.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the right of<br/>employees to form, join and participate in lawful activities of<br/>employee organizations and the equal, alternative right of<br/>employees to refuse to form, join and participate in employee<br/>organizations as specified by the Educational Employment<br/>Relations Act, Government Code Section 3540, et seq.<br/>Neither party shall exert pressure upon nor discriminate<br/>against an employee in the exercise of these alternative rights.</p>
<p>3.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, membership in the Association shall not be<br/>compulsory. A bargaining unit member has the right to<br/>choose, either: to become a member of the Association; or, to<br/>pay to the Association a fee for representation services, or to<br/>refrain from either of the above courses of action upon the<br/>groups set forth in Section 3.3.6 below.</p>
<p>3.3.3 Bargaining Unit Members' Obligations to Exclusive Representative</p>
<p>A bargaining unit member who does not fall within one of the exempted<br/>categories as set forth in Section 3.3.6 below, and who has not voluntarily<br/>made application for membership in the Association within the thirtieth (30th)<br/>day following the date upon which said employee has commenced duties in<br/>the District as a bargaining unit member, must as a condition of employment<br/>in the District pay annually to the Association a representation fee, in<br/>exchange for representation services necessarily performed by the<br/>Association in conformance with its legally imposed duty of fair<br/>representation on behalf of said bargaining unit member who is not a<br/>member of the Association.</p>
<p>In the event that a bargaining unit member shall not pay such fee directly to<br/>the Association, the District shall begin automatic payroll deduction as<br/>provided in Education Code Section 45061 and in the same manner as set<br/>forth in Paragraph 3.3.1 of this Article. There shall be no charge to the<br/>Association for such mandatory agency fee deductions.</p>
<p>Prior to beginning such payroll deduction, the Association will certify to the<br/>District in writing that the employee whose pay is to be affected by the<br/>deduction has: (1) refused to join the Association; (2) has refused to tender<br/>the amount of the agency fee as defined herein; and (3) does not qualify for<br/>an exemption under 3.3.6. <sup>10</sup></p>
<p>10</p>
<p>3.3.4 Definition of Representation Fee</p>
<p>The representation fee to be collected from non-Association bargaining unit<br/>members shall be the amount authorized by Section 3540.1 (l)(2) of the<br/>Government Code.</p>
<p>Any dispute as to the amount of the representation fee shall be resolved<br/>pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.3.7</p>
<p>3.3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions</p>
<p>3.3.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time, non-exempt bargaining unit members<br/>hired during the school year shall pay a prorated<br/>representation fee. Such pro rata share shall be<br/>based upon the number of days of actual<br/>employment for a school year as compared with<br/>the number of days available for full-time<br/>employment in the school year.</p>
<p>3.3.4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time, non-exempt bargaining unit members<br/>shall pay a prorated representation fee on the<br/>basis of the said bargaining unit member's annual<br/>salary as compared with the same annual salary<br/>for a comparable full-time bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>3.3.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members on leave without pay,<br/>and bargaining unit members who are on laid-off<br/>status shall be exempt from these provisions<br/>herein; except that the election as to membership<br/>or payment of a fee as set forth in Section 3.3.3<br/>must be exercised within the first ten (10) days<br/>upon return to paid status.</p>
<p>3.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Verification of Representation Fee By Association</p>
<p>At least thirty (30) days prior to any requested enforcement of a<br/>representation fee from any bargaining unit member pursuant to Section</p>
<p>3.3.3, the Association shall submit a written certification to the District<br/>verifying that the total amount of its representation fee conforms to this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>The parties agree that such certification is a condition precedent to<br/>enforcement of the fee by the District as a condition of employment.</p>
<p>3.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining Unit Members Exempted From Obligation to Pay</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Any bargaining unit member may be exempted from payment of any fees to<br/>the Association if that person is a member of a religious body whose<br/>traditional tenets or teaching include objections to joining or financially<br/>supporting an &quot;employee organization&quot; as defined in Section 3540.1(d) of the<br/>Government Code.</p>
<p>Such exempt bargaining unit member shall, as an alternative to payment of a<br/>representation fee to the Association, pay an amount equivalent to such<br/>representation fee to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Cancer Society; or</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other non-religious, non-labor charitable fund mutually agreed</p>
<p>upon by the District and the Association.</p>
<p>The District, upon written request from the Association, may require such<br/>exempt bargaining unit member to submit a written affidavit to the<br/>Association verifying the existence and nature of the allowable objection to<br/>payment of a representation fee and, in addition, may require such exempt<br/>bargaining unit member to submit proof of payment of an amount equivalent<br/>to such representation fee to one of the alternative funds or organizations<br/>listed above.</p>
<p>Such payments shall be made on or before October 1 of each school year<br/>for returning bargaining unit members or no more than thirty (30) days after<br/>commencing duties for any newly hired bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>3.3.7 Procedure for Bargaining Unit Members Who Contest the Amount of Fee</p>
<p>The parties agree that, in order to provide a uniform definition of the amount<br/>of the representation fee, any such disputes involving the amount of such fee<br/>shall first be deferred to the Public Employment Relations Board for<br/>determination, provided that the parties have first complied with the other<br/>provisions of this Section.</p>
<p>The Association will verify in writing to the District that all of the conditions of<br/>Section 3.3.3 have been met prior to the District's initiation of the fee<br/>deductions set forth in Section 3.3.3. Thereafter the District will notify the<br/>effected bargaining unit member in writing that such deductions will<br/>commence. A copy of the Association's written verification will be attached<br/>to the District's notice. Thereafter, the District will begin the deductions.</p>
<p>If, at any time, the Public Employment Relations Board determines that some<br/>or all of the fees deducted shall be held in escrow pending a determination of<br/>the correct amount of the fee, the District will deposit such amount in an <sup>12</sup></p>
<p>12</p>
<p>escrow account. The monies held in escrow shall be released to the<br/>appropriate party upon the rendering of a final decision by the Public<br/>Employment Relations Board.</p>
<p>3.3.8 Hold Harmless and Indemnity Provision</p>
<p>The Association as defined in this Agreement shall hold the District<br/>harmless, and shall fully and promptly reimburse the District for any fees,<br/>costs, charges or penalties incurred in responding to or defending against<br/>any claims, disputes, challenges, which are actually brought against the<br/>District or any of its agents, in connection with the administration or<br/>enforcement of any Section in this Agreement pertaining to representation<br/>fee. Such reimbursement shall include, but not be limited to, court costs,<br/>litigation expenses, and attorneys' fees incurred by the District.</p>
<p>Upon notice that the District is going to seek indemnification or to be held<br/>harmless under this provision, the Association shall have the right to meet<br/>with the District regarding the reasonableness and merit of any ciaim,<br/>demand, suit or action for which the District seeks indemnification, and shall<br/>attempt to agree whether any such action listed in the paragraph above shall<br/>be compromised, resisted, defended, tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>In determining whether or not such action shall be compromised, resisted,<br/>defended, tried or appealed, the District will defer to the Association's<br/>interests if the District does not have a distinct and separate legal interest in<br/>the matter in dispute.</p>
<p>The District shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for any costs for which the<br/>Association was not properly notified and provided the opportunity to discuss<br/>as set forth herein; nor will the District be entitled to any reimbursement<br/>when the District's efforts in defending against such action would be<br/>duplicative, or when the District does not have a separate and distinct<br/>interest to defend, or when the District is defending any activity which is<br/>arguably subject to criminal liability on the part of any District administrator. <sup>13</sup></p>

<p>ARTICLE 4 - HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Day</p>
<p>4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orderly conduct of school business requires certain set hours of on¬<br/>site responsibilities; therefore, the teacher day is set at seven and one-<br/>half (714) hours which includes a thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch period.<br/>This seven and one-half (7/4) hours is flexible, at bargaining unit member<br/>discretion, around a seven (7) hour period of time established by the<br/>Board of Trustees for each school site. Site administrators may set the<br/>beginning times on days of building faculty meetings.</p>
<p>4.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the teacher day noted above, all bargaining unit members<br/>are to participate as a professional obligation in Open House, Back-To-<br/>School Night, Report Card Conferences, Student Study Teams and<br/>lEP’s, Graduation and Parent Orientations.</p>
<p>4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members may be called upon to perform other duties<br/>outside the teacher day.

These hours are non-cumulative and shall not be assigned<br/>in a discriminatory manner.</p>
<p>4.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building principal may at his/her discretion permit bargaining unit<br/>members to depart from their school site early.</p>
<p>4.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members who complete their assigned responsibilities in<br/>Kindergarten Roundup outside the contract year will receive one (1) day<br/>paid leave.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one comp day per day of attendance at Environmental school or</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a combination of the above. <sup>14</sup></p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Because Environmental School is a 5th grade activity, it is assumed that 5th grade<br/>teachers will attend this activity, however, mitigating circumstances for non-<br/>attendance will be resolved by the principal and teacher. (Revised 7/13/99)</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Period</p>

<p>A district calendar committee which includes two members from the Association<br/>(appointed by the Association President) will review and discuss a draft calendar to<br/>be presented to the association and the district prior to February 1st of each year.<br/>The Association will provide input to the District regarding the draft calendar not<br/>later than March 1 st.</p>
<p>Following board approval, a calendar for each year of this contract shall be attached<br/>to this Agreement as Exhibit A and shall include five (5) minimum days in November<br/>for conferencing plus one (1) minimum day on the last day of school, all to be built<br/>into each year's calendar, along with Wednesday collaboration meeting days<br/>excluding the first and last week of school.

<p>ARTICLE 5 - ASSIGNMENTS, REASSIGNMENTS, TRANSFERS</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments and Change of Assignments</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Article, &quot;assignment&quot; is the designation of a specific<br/>position or responsibilities within a school or department or work location.<br/>Assignment includes the initial placement of a newly employed bargaining<br/>unit member in a specific school or work location as well as the change of a<br/>bargaining unit member's position or responsibilities within the same school<br/>or department or work location. &quot;Assignment&quot; does not include any extra¬<br/>curricular duty.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals shall assign bargaining unit members. In making assignments,<br/>principals shall consider bargaining unit member’s training, experience,<br/>major and minor fields of study, competencies, credentials, and advanced<br/>degrees related to the assignment. A bargaining unit member may request<br/>the reasons for an assignment or change of assignment.</p>
<p>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once each year, a bargaining unit member will submit a District<br/>&quot;Employment Projection Survey.&quot; To the extent possible, the principals shall<br/>consider a bargaining unit member's preference in making assignments.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first week of May the principal shall indicate the available<br/>teaching positions and shall endeavor to fill the position from the existing<br/>staff in the school.</p>
<p>5.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tentative assignment list shall be published by the District no later than<br/>June 1 of the school year preceding the effective date.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignments Due to Layoff</p>
<p>5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Article, &quot;reassignment&quot; shall be defined as a change to<br/>a different program and/or a movement from one work site to another as a<br/>result of layoff pursuant to Education Code Section 44955, and which may<br/>be necessary to assure the retention of certificated bargaining unit members<br/>with seniority greater than those laid off. This definition specifically excludes<br/>any transfer or change in program assignment which does not result from<br/>the District's obligation to reassign pursuant to Section 44955 of the<br/>Education Code.</p>
<p>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member scheduled to be reassigned due to layoff shall<br/>be entitled to a written notice of such reassignment within ten (10) calendar<br/>days of the effective date of such reassignment and, in addition, upon<br/>request, will be entitled to a conference with the principal and the<br/>Superintendent regarding the reassignment, at which time the bargaining <sup>16</sup></p>

<p>5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Article, a &quot;transfer&quot; shall consist of a change in work<br/>location of a Bargaining unit member from one school or work site to<br/>another school or work site within the District. Such a transfer does not<br/>encompass the process of assignment to a specific position and<br/>responsibilities within the school, or department, or work location. A<br/>bargaining unit member assigned to more than one work site shall be<br/>considered as being transferred only when moved from one District-wide<br/>program to another program. Voluntary transfers for the next school year<br/>will be considered from January 31 until the first day teachers report to work.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;vacancy&quot; is a new position, an opening arising from a resignation,<br/>retirement, or, termination, any position to which a bargaining unit member<br/>is not assigned or which is not committed for purposes of leaves,<br/>unresolved involuntary transfers or layoffs.</p>

Such<br/>vacancies shall be posted and filled according to Sections 5.3.4-5.3.7 for<br/>the next school year, (revised 7/1/97)</p>
<p>5.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices of vacancies shall be posted no later than the first week in May of<br/>the school year preceding the effective date of the transfer and shall remain<br/>posted for at least five (5) working days in the District administration office<br/>and the staff room at each site. Such notices shall be posted as soon as<br/>the District determines that a vacancy exists and shall include the position<br/>description and location, grade level or subject matter assignment,<br/>credential and other special requirements. A copy of the vacancy notice<br/>shall be forwarded to the Association President. During summer vacation,<br/>vacancy notices will be mailed to designated Association officers and to<br/>bargaining unit members who have indicated to the District, in writing, an<br/>interest in vacancies.</p>

<p>5.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for voluntary transfer for each vacancy shall be processed as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>5.3.6.1 The Personnel Office shall determine whether each bargaining<br/>unit member requesting the transfer holds the necessary<br/>credential and endorsements/authorizations.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>5.3.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those requesting a transfer, the three appropriately</p>
<p>credentialed, bargaining unit members with the greatest District</p>

<p>the opportunity to share their experience, training, professional</p>
<p>characteristics and other qualifications. (Revised 6/02 - will be reviewed<br/>after the 2002-03 school year for its effectiveness)</p>
<p>5.3.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interviews shall be conducted by a committee. Bargaining unit<br/>members may volunteer to be on an Interview Committee.<br/>The principal shall select the bargaining unit members on the<br/>Committee from those who volunteer. If no bargaining unit<br/>member volunteers, the principal shall appoint the members of<br/>the Committee. In any event, each Interview Committee shall<br/>include the site administrator or designee and the RTA building<br/>representative or designee. Whenever possible, the<br/>Committee should include at least one bargaining unit member<br/>currently assigned to the same grade level, department or<br/>family/team as the vacancy. The principal may appoint a<br/>parent and/or a classified employee at the site to the<br/>committee.</p>
<p>5.3.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After offering an interview opportunity to appropriate bargaining<br/>unit members requesting a transfer, the Committee shall<br/>submit a recommendation in writing to the principal. The<br/>principal shall make the final decision from those qualifying<br/>under 5.3.6.2.</p>
<p>5.3.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member requesting transfer shall be<br/>notified in writing within ten (10) working days by the Personnel<br/>Office of the acceptance or denial of the transfer.</p>
<p>5.4 District-Initiated (Involuntary) Transfers</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving input from the Association president or designee, the<br/>Superintendent or designee shall make involuntary transfers as necessary<br/>to mitigate community and/or staff problems.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the involuntary transfer is necessary because of changes in enrollment,<br/>the District shall either transfer the permanent bargaining unit member with<br/>the least District seniority at the transferring site or deviate from transferring<br/>in order of least seniority for the following reasons:</p>
<p>5.4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may demonstrate a specific need for personnel to</p>
<p>teach a specific course or to provide services authorized by a<br/>credential which others with more seniority do not possess.</p>
<p>IB</p>
<p>5.4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may use two specialized exemptions. Specialized<br/>exemptions may only be used for one teacher-in-charge<br/>assignment. (Revised 9/2004)</p>
<p>5.4.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more senior bargaining unit member elects to be involuntarily<br/>transferred.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member being transferred involuntarily for the following<br/>school year shall be notified as early as possible before the first day of the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>5.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order of most District seniority, the bargaining unit member(s), qualified<br/>by credential, will select their work site of choice where vacancies exist.</p>
<p>(Revised 3/96)</p>

<p>6.1.1 Probationary Bargaining Unit Members</p>
<p>(Revised 3/12/96)</p>
<p>In accordance with this Article and the procedures set forth in the District's<br/>Evaluation Handbook (which procedures are hereby incorporated by<br/>reference), every probationary bargaining unit member shall be evaluated<br/>by an administrator in writing at least twice each school year. Prior to<br/>October 15, the evaluator and the first and second year probationary<br/>bargaining unit member shall meet to discuss criteria upon which the<br/>evaluation is to be based. Following this meeting, the evaluator shall<br/>determine the elements and modifications, if any, upon which the evaluation<br/>shall be based. If the bargaining unit member disagrees with that decision,<br/>he/she may file a statement to that effect.</p>
<p>The first evaluation for first and second year probationary employees shall<br/>be completed by December 15. If any areas are identified as below District<br/>standards, a second evaluation for first and second year probationary<br/>employees shall be held by March 15. In all cases, a final evaluation for first<br/>and second year probationary employees shall be completed by May 15th.</p>
<p>6.1.2 Permanent Bargaining Unit Members</p>
<p>In accordance with this Article and the procedures set forth in the District's<br/>Evaluation Handbook (which procedures are hereby incorporated by<br/>reference) every permanent certificated bargaining unit member shall be<br/>evaluated by an administrator in writing two times during the first two years of<br/>temporary and probationary employment. Year three through ten<br/>evaluations may be on a bi-annual basis. After ten years, evaluations may<br/>be every three years. During the last year of employment, employees who<br/>indicate that they are going to retire at the end of that school year will not be<br/>evaluated during that school year. Upon request, the Association shall be<br/>provided with a list of bargaining unit members being formally evaluated<br/>during the current year. (Revised 7/1/05)</p>
<p>6.2 Process of Evaluation</p>
<p>6.2.1 Each evaluation shall be based upon a minimum of forty-five (45) minutes of<br/>observation. As a part of the evaluation process, one (1) formal observation<br/>shall be a minimum of twenty (20) minutes. The remaining time may be<br/>divided between two (2) or more informal observations. The bargaining unit<br/>member shall have a conference and receive a written summary of the <sup>21</sup></p>
<p>21</p>
<p>formal observation within four (4) working days of the formal observation.<br/>This requirement is limited to the resident teaching staff. Observations shall<br/>not be held when student teachers are responsible for the class.</p>

Additionally, the evaluatee may attach a counter statement to any<br/>negative observation summary. Both parties may agree to a second<br/>evaluator, who shall be a District administrator.</p>
<p>6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation reports shall be prepared in triplicate with the original going to<br/>the Personnel Office, one (1) copy to the bargaining unit member being<br/>evaluated, and the other copy to remain in the school file. All copies are to<br/>be signed by the evaluator and the evaluatee.</p>
<p>6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The established grievance resolution procedure of the District may be<br/>utilized for processing any disputes which arise over evaluation procedure.</p>
<p>6.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a year in which a permanent bargaining unit member is not being<br/>formally evaluated, (s)he may request that the supervising administrator<br/>conduct two or more classroom observations totaling forty-five (45) minutes<br/>or more. The purpose of the observation is to cooperatively work together<br/>to improve instructional skills. No record of this observation shall be placed<br/>in the bargaining unit member's personnel file. (Revised3/12/96)</p>
<p>6.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to March 15th for second year probationary employees and May 15th<br/>for permanent employees, evaluators shall make recommendations<br/>concerning any unsatisfactory employee whose services may be considered<br/>for termination. (Revised4/5/93)</p>
<p>6.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluators shall not base their evaluations of an employee on hearsay<br/>information.</p>
<p>6.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members will not be evaluated in the areas of art and music<br/>unless this is their assignment.</p>
<p>6.3 Alternative Evaluation for Permanent Bargaining Unit Members</p>

<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 15, the bargaining unit member and the evaluator shall agree to<br/>a written evaluation plan. The parties recognize that an alternative<br/>evaluation plan is intended to be a collaborative undertaking between the <sup>22</sup></p>
<p>22</p>
<p>bargaining unit member and the supervisor. It is not the intention of the<br/>parties to restrict innovation and creativity; therefore, the following options<br/>are only examples (details of evaluation options will be provided to<br/>bargaining unit members):</p>
<p>6.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitation/Co-Visitation:</p>

<p>6.3.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Training:</p>
<p>All tapes shall remain the exclusive custody of the bargaining<br/>unit member.</p>

<p>6.4 Personnel Files</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member shall be provided copies of any negative or<br/>derogatory material as applies to the evaluation before it is placed in his/her<br/>personnel file. Bargaining unit members may add a response to negative<br/>comments contained in an evaluation.</p>
<p>6.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If subsequent remedial action eliminates the negative evaluation and/or the<br/>identified deficiencies, the evaluations citing the deficiencies shall be<br/>removed from the evaluatee’s file after a period of four (4) years after the <sup>23</sup></p>
<p>23</p>
<p>remedial action and certification of the remedial action, provided, however,<br/>that after three (3) years, the evaluatee may file a written request for<br/>removal with the Superintendent.</p>
<p>6.5 Complaints</p>
<p>The channel for complaints concerning school personnel shall be from complainant</p>
<p>to bargaining unit members to principal to Superintendent to Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>the bargaining unit members concerned must be submitted in writing before further</p>

In the event that the Governing Board does<br/>not give notice pursuant to this section on or before March 15, the second<br/>year probationary bargaining unit member shall be deemed reelected for<br/>the next succeeding school year. A first year probationary bargaining unit<br/>member shall be notified of non-reelection on or before June 1.</p>

<p>28</p>
<p>7.2.2.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, delete,<br/>or alter any provisions of this Agreement, but shall<br/>limit his/her decision to the application and<br/>interpretation of its provisions.

<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members may utilize one and a half (114) days of their<br/>accumulated sick leave if they are ill while employed by the District<br/>teaching summer school (a summer school day of four (4) paid hours or<br/>less than one-half (!4) day of regular accumulated sick leave).</p>
<p>8.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a physician's verification of illness if a bargaining<br/>unit member has been on sick leave for five (5) or more consecutive<br/>days. <sup>30</sup></p>
<p>30</p>
<p>8.2.5 When a bargaining unit member is absent due to illness for a period of 5<br/>months or less and has exhausted his/her sick leave, the sum which is<br/>paid a substitute or would have been paid a substitute will be deducted<br/>from his/her salary.</p>

<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members who are working are entitled to use personal<br/>illness and injury leave for disabilities caused or contributed to by<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom on the same<br/>terms and conditions governing leaves of absence for other illness or<br/>medical disability. Such leave shall not be used for child care, child<br/>rearing, or preparation for childbearing, but shall be limited to those<br/>disabilities as set forth above. The length of such disability leave,<br/>including the date on which the leave shall commence and the date on<br/>which the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the<br/>bargaining unit member and the bargaining unit member’s physician.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members are entitled to leave without pay or other<br/>benefits for disabilities because of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or<br/>recovery therefrom when sick leave has been exhausted. The date on<br/>which the bargaining unit member shall resume duties shall be<br/>determined by the bargaining unit member on leave and the bargaining<br/>unit member’s physician.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>8.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bargaining unit member shall be entitled to a total of five (5) days<br/>of paid leave of absence for bereavement. These days may be used for<br/>the death of any member of his/her family. Such days shall be equivalent<br/>in hours to the bargaining unit member's normal work day. These five (5)<br/>days may be used either immediately preceding or following death.</p>
<p>8.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 8.4.1 above, two (2) days of<br/>the five (5) days may be used by bargaining unit members in the unit for<br/>the death of a person not in the immediate family as defined in Section</p>
<p>8.1.1 of this Article; provided that the bargaining unit member wishes to<br/>make use of this provision presents his/her request to the Superintendent<br/>and receives approval of the Superintendent in advance of taking the<br/>leave.</p>
<p>8.5 Industrial Accident Leave</p>
<p>8.5.1 The term &quot;Industrial Accident Leave&quot; as hereinafter used is construed to<br/>mean an automatic leave of absence granted to a certificated bargaining<br/>unit member whenever such absence is the result of an accident on the <sup>31</sup></p>
<p>31</p>
<p>job resulting in a workers' compensation claim, which the Workers'<br/>Compensation Insurance Fund considers valid.</p>
<p>8.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall be for no more than sixty (60) days during which the<br/>schools of the District are required to be in session or when the<br/>bargaining unit member would otherwise have been performing work for<br/>the District in any one (1) fiscal year for the same accident.</p>
<p>8.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>8.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of<br/>absence.</p>
<p>8.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bargaining unit member employed in a position requiring<br/>certification qualifications is absent from his duties caused by an<br/>industrial accident or illness, he/she shall be paid such portion of the<br/>salary due him/her for any month in which the absence occurs, as when<br/>added to his temporary disability indemnity under Division 4 or Division</p>
<p>4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a payment to him/her of not more<br/>than his full salary.</p>
<p>8.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each<br/>day of authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity<br/>award.</p>
<p>8.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal<br/>year, the bargaining unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of<br/>unused leave due him/her for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>8.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the bargaining<br/>unit member shall be entitled to benefits provided in the other leave<br/>sections of this Agreement, and for the purposes of each of these<br/>sections, his/her absence shall be deemed to have been commenced on<br/>the date of termination of the industrial accident or leave, provided that, if<br/>the bargaining unit member continues to receive temporary disability<br/>indemnity, it will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his full<br/>salary.</p>
<p>8.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the bargaining unit member shall<br/>endorse to the District the temporary disability indemnity checks received<br/>on account of his industrial accident or illness. The District, in turn, shall<br/>issue the bargaining unit member appropriate salary warrants for<br/>payment of the bargaining unit member's salary and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement and other authorized deductions.</p>
<p>8.5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member receiving benefits as a result of this section<br/>shall, during periods of injury or illness, remain within the state of</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>California unless the Board of Trustees authorized travel outside the<br/>state. Under emergency conditions, the Superintendent shall have the<br/>authority to grant the bargaining unit member permission to leave the<br/>state.</p>
<p>8.5.11 Bargaining unit members who believe that their illness or injury is covered<br/>by workers' compensation, therefore, would come under the provisions of<br/>this industrial accident leave policy and shall notify their immediate<br/>supervisor, in writing, stating the facts pertinent to the situation. The<br/>supervisor shall then forward the request to the office of the<br/>Superintendent for Board action.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity</p>
<p>Up to seven (7) days of sick leave per year may be used by the bargaining unit</p>
<p>member at his/her election for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1 Death of a member of his/her immediate family when additional leave is<br/>required beyond that provided under Bereavement Leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving person or property or the person or property of a member<br/>of the immediate family.</p>

<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Leave</p>
<p>8.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members shall be allowed up to three (3) days per year<br/>for personal leave. One (1) of the three (3) days may be used at any<br/>time, at the discretion of the bargaining unit member. During such leave,<br/>the cost of the substitute shall be deducted from the bargaining unit<br/>member's salary or the bargaining unit member may request that the<br/>leave be subtracted from his/her sick leave.</p>
<p>8.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal leave may be extended beyond the three (3) total days at the<br/>sole discretion of the Superintendent. Such extended leave shall be<br/>charged to sick leave. Each request shall be considered on its own<br/>merits, and the denial and approval of the leave shall not set a precedent<br/>for other requests.</p>
<p>8.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) additional days may be taken without compensation. <sup>33</sup></p>
<p>33</p>
<p>8.7 4 A bargaining unit member shall notify his/her principal and the<br/>Superintendent (if applicable) at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of<br/>taking personal leave unless an emergency makes advance notification<br/>impossible.</p>
<p>8.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal leave may not be used to extend school holidays without the<br/>written permission from the site administrator.</p>
<p>8.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal leave shall not be cumulative.</p>
<p>8.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury and Court Witness</p>
<p>Leave of absence to serve on jury or to appear as a witness in court other than as a<br/>litigant shall be granted with no loss in pay provided the bargaining unit member<br/>reimburses the District all compensation received, excluding travel expenses.</p>
<p>8.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>8.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave is an investment in the bargaining unit member's future<br/>value to the District more than a reward for past services. It may be<br/>granted by the Board for a period not to exceed one (1) year for travel or<br/>study and must be followed by two (2) years of service to the District.</p>
<p>8.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave must be preceded by at least seven (7) consecutive<br/>years of teaching service, all of which have been served as a regular full¬<br/>time bargaining unit member in the Redding Elementary School District.<br/>Seventy-five percent (75%) of the teaching days in each year count as a<br/>full year of teaching service.</p>
<p>8.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of bargaining unit members absent on sabbatical leave at<br/>any one time shall not exceed two percent (2%) of the total number of<br/>bargaining unit members. The number eligible will be rounded to the next<br/>highest whole number.</p>
<p>8.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave will be granted for no more than one (1) year, but a<br/>leave of absence without pay for one (1) year may follow or precede the<br/>sabbatical leave. Sabbatical leaves may be granted for a semester<br/>during each of two (2) school years with the approval of the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>8.9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation while on sabbatical leave shall be sixty percent (60%) of<br/>the annual salary of bargaining unit member in accordance with the<br/>provisions of the salary schedule in effect during the period of the leave.<br/>Eligible bargaining unit members shall continue to receive paid health<br/>and welfare benefits while on sabbatical leave. <sup>34</sup></p>
<p>34</p>
<p>8.9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants who desire to receive a monthly salary allowance while on<br/>sabbatical leave must furnish a suitable bond indemnifying the District for<br/>any salary paid during the period of the sabbatical leave in the event the<br/>bargaining unit member fails to return to render services to the District<br/>equivalent to twice the period of the sabbatical leave following the<br/>termination of the sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>8.9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants who do not desire to furnish a bond and receive salary while<br/>on sabbatical leave shall be paid in accordance with the Business<br/>Department's procedure in two (2) equal annual installments as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the first year of service after the bargaining unit<br/>member's return to duty, the Business Department shall release<br/>the first installment upon receipt of the Board of Trustees'<br/>resolution authorizing the payment of said installment, and<br/>including an affirmative statement to the effect that the bargaining<br/>unit member has completed one (1) year of service and fulfilled all<br/>other legal requirements.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the second year, a similar procedure shall be<br/>followed authorizing payment of the second and final payment.</p>
<p>8.9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following activities will be considered appropriate. They are listed in<br/>the order of general preference, although the needs of the school system<br/>and of the particular bargaining unit member applying for leave will be<br/>considered for each case.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advanced degree or planned graduate work under the supervision<br/>of the Superintendent. A minimum of twenty (20) semester units<br/>of study will be required for full-year leaves and a minimum often<br/>(10) semester units will be required for half-year leaves.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel that is:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purposeful;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a nature and extent not possible during summer vacation;</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designed for obvious benefit to the District as stated in the<br/>application and agreed to by the screening committee.</p>
<p>Application for leaves during the first semester must be in the<br/>Superintendent's office not later than the first school day of the preceding<br/>September. Applications must be made on the standard forms provided<br/>by the Superintendent's office. All activities for which leaves are granted<br/>must be planned in consultation with the Superintendent. Any changes in <sup>35</sup></p>
<p>35</p>
<p>such plans must be approved in advance by the Superintendent. This<br/>applies at anytime during the leave period.</p>
<p>A screening committee shall be formed to review applications and make<br/>recommendations to the Superintendent as to the priority of the<br/>applicants. The membership of the committee shall be:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendent;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of the Association;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bargaining unit members appointed by the Association; and</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A principal selected by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>8.9.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When formal college credit has been granted during leave, an official<br/>transcript will be required.</p>
<p>8.9.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaves have been granted for any other purpose, written reports<br/>planned in consultation with the Superintendent will be required.</p>
<p>8.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child-Rearing Leave</p>
<p>8.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member shall be granted one (1) day of paid leave and<br/>three (3) days of sick leave for the purpose of caring for the needs of a<br/>newborn or adopted child within six (6) weeks of birth or placement.</p>
<p>8.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member shall, upon request, be granted leave of<br/>absence without pay or benefits for a period up to an entire school year<br/>for the purpose of caring for a newborn or adopted child. The bargaining<br/>unit member shall have the option of maintaining heaith benefits by<br/>remitting to the District the cost of such benefits.</p>
<p>8.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Leaves</p>
<p>8.11.1 All other leaves of absence not provided for above must be granted by a<br/>special action of the Superintendent or Board of Trustees. Failure on the<br/>part of any bargaining unit member to secure a grant for such other<br/>leave, before absenting himself/herselffrom his/her assigned duties, may<br/>be considered as a resignation of that bargaining unit member from the<br/>teaching staff of the District.</p>
<p>All bargaining unit members on leaves of absence during the last<br/>semester of the school year shall notify the Superintendent prior to<br/>January 15 whether or not they intend to return to their assignment the<br/>following school year. Failure to so notify may be interpreted as a<br/>resignation. Prior to January 1 of each year, the Superintendent shall<br/>notify, in writing, any bargaining unit member on leave of this<br/>requirement. <sup>36</sup></p>

<p>ARTICLE 17 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>171 Definitions</p>
<p>17.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by one or more bargaining unit members or the<br/>Association that there has been a misinterpretation, misapplication, or<br/>violation of a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>17.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day the bargaining unit member is required by this<br/>Agreement to be on duty.</p>
<p>17.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator who has<br/>been designated to address and attempt to resolve grievances and who<br/>has immediate jurisdiction over the grievant.</p>
<p>17.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; is the person or persons, including the Association, making<br/>the claim.</p>
<p>17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of the procedure is to attempt to secure equitable solutions to<br/>grievances at the lowest possible level. The grievant and immediate supervisor<br/>should attempt to resolve the grievance at the informal level.</p>
<p>17.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>17.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed<br/>separately from the personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>17.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, making appeals, making<br/>reports and recommendations, and other necessary documents shall be<br/>prepared jointly by the District and the Association and given appropriate<br/>distribution by the Association so as to facilitate operation of the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>17.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the grievant to adhere to the time deadlines shall mean that the<br/>grievant is satisfied with the previous decision and waives the right to<br/>further appeal. The grievant and/or the Association and the District may<br/>extend any time deadline by mutual agreement. Absence of either the<br/>grievant or the immediate supervisor due to illness or emergency<br/>constitutes a basis for extension of time lines and the parties may agree<br/>to extend timelines.</p>
<p>17.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effort will be made to schedule meetings for the processing of<br/>grievances at times which will not interfere with the required work day of <sup>61</sup></p>
<p>61</p>
<p>the participants. If any grievance meeting or hearing is scheduled during<br/>the school day, any employee required by either party to participate as a<br/>witness or grievant in such meeting or hearing shall be released from<br/>regular duties without loss of pay for a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p>17.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the arbitration level, either party to the grievance may be<br/>represented at any step of the grievance procedure by an individual of<br/>that party's choice.</p>
<p>17.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall not be applied in an arbitrary, discriminatory or<br/>capricious manner.</p>
<p>17.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bargaining unit member may at any time present grievances to the<br/>District and have such grievances adjusted without the intervention of the<br/>Association, as long as the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and<br/>the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. The<br/>District shall not agree to a resolution of any grievance until the<br/>Association has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response. Upon<br/>request of the grievant, the grievant may be represented at any stage of<br/>the grievance procedure by a representative of the Association.</p>
<p>17.4 Procedure</p>
<p>Grievances will be processed in accordance with the following procedures:</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of specific actions requested of the District which will<br/>remedy the grievance.</p>
<p>17.4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall communicate the decision to the<br/>grievant in writing within ten (10) days after receiving the<br/>grievance. If the immediate supervisor does not respond within<br/>the time limits the grievance shall be deemed denied and the<br/>grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>

<p>If a grievance is not resolved at Level II, either the Association or the<br/>District shall refer the grievance to non-binding mediation within 10 days.</p>
<p>The Association and the District may mutually agree to use the interest<br/>based process and may mutually agree to a facilitator. If either party<br/>does not wish to use the interest process, that party shall request<br/>appointment of a mediator by the California State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Office. <sup>63</sup></p>
<p>63</p>
<p>The mediator or facilitator shall assist the parties in the resolution of the<br/>grievance. Referral to Level IV shall not occur until the<br/>mediator/facilitator has released the parties from the mediation process.</p>
<p>17 4.5 Level IV - Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>17.4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the proposed resolution at Level<br/>III, the grievant may, within ten (10) days of the receipt of the<br/>decision, submit a request in writing to the Association for<br/>arbitration of the dispute. Within twenty (20) days of the grievant's<br/>receipt of the proposed resolution at Level III, the Association shall<br/>inform the District of its intent as to whether or not the grievance<br/>will be submitted to arbitration. The Association and the District<br/>shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator within five (5) days. If no<br/>agreement can be reached, the parties shall request that the State<br/>Conciliation Service supply a panel of five names of persons<br/>experienced in hearing grievances in public schools. Each party<br/>shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The<br/>remaining panel member shall be the arbitrator. The order of the<br/>striking shall be determined by lot. Nothing shall prevent the<br/>parties by mutual agreement from requesting an additional list of<br/>prospective arbitrators.</p>
<p>17.4.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and<br/>render a decision on the issue or issues submitted to him/her<br/>including the arbitrability of the grievance. If the parties cannot<br/>agree upon a submission agreement, the arbitrator shall<br/>determine the issues.</p>
<p>17 4.5.3 The District and the Association agree that the jurisdiction and<br/>authority of the arbitrator so selected and the opinions the<br/>arbitrator expresses will be confined to the interpretation of the<br/>specific provision or provisions of this Agreement at issue between<br/>the parties. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,<br/>subtract from, amend, or modify any provisions of this Agreement.<br/>The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any<br/>decision that requires the District or the Association to do an act<br/>prohibited by law.</p>
<p>17.4.5.4 After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to<br/>make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit, in writing to all<br/>parties, his/her findings and award. If the parties mutually agree<br/>to expedited arbitration the written brief shall be waived.</p>
<p>17 4.5.5 The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. <sup>64</sup></p>
<p>64</p>
<p>17=4.5.6 The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by<br/>the District and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne<br/>by the party incurring them. Either party may request a certified<br/>court reporter to record the entire arbitration hearing. The cost of<br/>the services of such court reporter shall be paid by the party<br/>requesting the reporter or shared by the parties if they mutually<br/>agree. If the arbitrator requests a court reporter, then the costs<br/>shall be shared by both parties. <sup>65</sup></p>
<p>65</p>
