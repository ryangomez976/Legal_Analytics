The seven half-time Unit Members agree to pay<br/>three fourteenths (3/14) of the fringe benefit package.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If eight (8) Unit Members provide half-time service to the District, the<br/>District agrees to pay three-fourths (3/4) of the cost of the fringe<br/>benefit package for each of the eight Unit Members on half-time<br/>service.

<p>The District flexible spending account plan has been designed to meet Internal<br/>Revenue Service (IRS) guidelines as a '’cafeteria plan&quot; under IRS Section 125.<br/>The flexible spending account plan allows the certificated employee the option of<br/>extending and/or paying for (1) additional health benefits, (2) some health care not<br/>covered by other benefit plans, and (3) some dependent care expenses by placing<br/>a portion of his/her salary into special accounts.</p>
<p>7.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent of the Flexible Spending Account Plan</p>
<p>Neither the D istrict nor the Association provides tax advice to employees in<br/>regard to their participation in the flexible spending account plan. It is up to<br/>the individual employee to choose to participate or not participate in this<br/>plan and to determine the level of participation. The intent of offering the<br/>plan is to provide a cafeteria plan which complies with IRS regulations. The<br/>benefit (the flexible spending account plan) is bound by IRS guidelines.</p>
<p>7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexible Spending Accounts</p>
<p>There shall be three flexible spending accounts available for the certificated<br/>employee. These accounts will be:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Premium Conversion Account</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dependent Care Account</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Expense Reimbursement Account</p>

<p>Participation in any or all of the above accounts is an option to be decided<br/>by each employee. The amounts directed into these accounts are at the<br/>discretion of the employee and must be within the guidelines set by the<br/>Internal Revenue Service. It shall be the employee's responsibility to<br/>participate in yearly open enrollment periods and to notify the District, with<br/>appropriate District-supplied forms, as to the exact amounts of the<br/>deductions directed toward each flexible spending account. Employees<br/>may choose to increase, decrease, or stop participation during an annual<br/>open enrollment period. Flexible spending accounts may be changed only<br/>during the annual open enrollment period unless the employee has a<br/>change in family status during the year. A change in family status includes<br/>marriage or divorce, birth or adoption, death, or the termination of<br/>employee's spouse's employment. The District will advance no more than<br/>$1,500 to any employee for use to cover costs of medical reimbursement.</p>
<p>7.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forfeiture of Funds</p>
<p>If an employee does not use all funds in his/her flexible spending account<br/>during the benefit year (October 1 through September 30), those funds<br/>remaining in a flexible spending account must be forfeited in accordance<br/>with current tax laws. In the event that there are funds in employees'<br/>flexible spending accounts after the end of the benefit year, those funds will<br/>be forfeited and applied toward the costs of operating the plan.</p>
<p>7.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration of Plan</p>
<p>There may be a monthly administrative cost paid by the employer for<br/>portions of this plan (Medical Expense Reimbursement and Dependent<br/>Care accounts) during the period of this contract.</p>
<p>7.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any time the IRS disallows this pre-tax plan, this program will be</p>
<p>-18-</p>
<p>dropped by the District and the District will assume no responsibility for any<br/>employee losses due to disallowance or non-use of funds in a calendar<br/>year.</p>

<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROCEDURE</p>
<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Grievance” - An assertion by a Unit Member or the Association that there has</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been a violation, misapplication, or misinterpretation of the terms of the Agreement</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which personally and adversely affects said Member of the Unit.</p>
<p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Party in Interest” - Person or persons making the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claim and any person who</p>
<p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be required to take action or against who action might be taken in order to</p>
<p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolve&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the claim.</p>
<p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Grievant&quot; - A Unit Member or the Association who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is filing a grievance, or the</p>
<p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association when the alleged contract violation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applies exclusively to the</p>
<p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association as defined in Article 13.5.4 of this contract.</p>
<p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Representative&quot; - A fellow employee, administrator, agent of Exclusive</p>
<p>14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representative, or legal counsel who shall represent any party in interest at</p>
<p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his/her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;election.</p>
<p>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose. The purpose of a grievance procedure is to process a claim of grievance</p>
<p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to secure, at the administrative level closest to the aggrieved party, solutions</p>
<p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to problems which may, from time to time, arise concerning the interpretation of</p>
<p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the terms of this Agreement. The parties agree to keep the proceedings as</p>
<p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure. The</p>
<p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance procedure shall not be construed as in any way hindering, discouraging,</p>
<p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or denying the settlement of grievances outside the structure of the grievance</p>
<p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedure.</p>
<p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.2.1 General Provisions. Since it is important that grievances be</p>
<p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processed as rapidly as possible, the number of days indicated at each</p>
<p>26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level should be considered as a maximum and every effort should be</p>
<p>27 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made to expedite the process. The time specified, however, may be</p>
<p>28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extended by mutual consent.</p>

<p>In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be<br/>processed through all levels in this grievance procedure by the end of<br/>the school year, the time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that<br/>the grievance procedure may be completed, if possible, prior to the end<br/>of the school year, or as soon thereafter as it is practical.</p>
<p>13.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his/her discretion, Unit Member may have another Association<br/>Member present at the informal level of a grievance. A Unit Member<br/>may be represented at Levels II, III, or IV by himself/herself, and/or at<br/>the employee’s option, by a representative of his/her choice; and the<br/>employee may change this designation of a representative at any level<br/>during the grievance process.</p>
<p>13.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a Member of<br/>the Administration at a level above the principal or immediate<br/>supervisor, the grievant shall submit such grievance in writing to the<br/>Superintendent and the processing of such grievance will be<br/>commenced at Formal Level 11.</p>
<p>13.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggrieved individuals not under the supervision of a principal may start<br/>at Level II.</p>
<p>13.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances will be available in each principal's office<br/>and in the District Office.</p>
<p>13.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent, or his designee, and the aggrieved agree to make<br/>available to all interested parties all pertinent information not privileged<br/>under law which is relevant to the issues raised by the grievance.</p>
<p>13.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No grievance shall be recognized unless it shall have been presented<br/>at the appropriate level within twenty (20) duty days after the aggrieved<br/>person knew or should have known of the act of condition and its<br/>aggrieved nature that form the basis of the grievance, and if not so</p>

<p>Should the investigation or processing of any grievance require that a<br/>Unit Member or an agent of the Exclusive Representative be released<br/>from regular assignment, this person shall be released from regular<br/>assignment without loss of pay or benefits.</p>
<p>Any record(s) pertaining to a grievance shall be kept in a grievance file<br/>separate from the employee's personnel file.</p>
<p>Any grievance not appealed to the next step of the procedure within the<br/>prescribed time limits shall be considered settled on the basis of the<br/>answer given at the preceding step.</p>

<p>13.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance shall not be subjected to this advisory arbitration<br/>provision unless the Association has agreed to refer said grievance to<br/>arbitration by delivering written notice of its desire to arbitrate to the<br/>Superintendent and the California State Mediation and Conciliation<br/>Service within five (5) days following the Formal Level II decision. In<br/>the event that the Association has not agreed and endorsed its<br/>approval to arbitrate the grievance within such five (5) day period, the<br/>disposition of the grievance at Formal Level II shall be final and<br/>binding on all persons. The voluntary labor arbitration rules of the<br/>California State Mediation and Conciliation Service shall apply in this<br/>step except where the specific language herein is in conflict, which<br/>specific language shall prevail. It is expressly understood and agreed<br/>that the only matters which are subject to advisory arbitration are<br/>grievances which claim the District has violated a mandatory subject of<br/>collective negotiations specified in 13.1 included as a specific provision<br/>of this Agreement which personally and adversely affected the rights of<br/>the grievant. No grievant shall use the grievance arbitration provisions<br/>to appeal any decision of the District or its representatives if such<br/>decision is pursuant to any order of or written agreement with any state</p>

<p>or federal court, regulatory commission or agency. Further, the<br/>provision of Article 1 - Definitions, Article 2 - Recognition, Article 10 -<br/>Evaluation Procedures (other than procedure), Article 11 - Safety<br/>Conditions of Employment, Article 21 - Savings, are specifically<br/>excluded from advisory arbitration under the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>No such claim shall be filed for arbitration unless such claim is<br/>processed in accordance with the limitations and procedures of this<br/>article. Processing and discussing the merits of an alleged grievance<br/>by the District shall not constitute a waiver by the District of a defense<br/>that the dispute is not grievable.</p>
<p>13.4.3 Selection of Arbitrator. As soon as possible and in any event not later<br/>than ten (10) days after the District receives the written notice of the<br/>Association's desire to arbitrate, the parties shall agree upon an<br/>arbitrator. In such case, the parties shall request a list of arbitrators<br/>from the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service (CSMCS)<br/>in accordance with CSMCS procedures. The party who strikes the first<br/>name shall be determined by lot. If the arbitrator selected indicates<br/>that he/she will not be available for hearing within a reasonable time<br/>not exceeding sixty (60) days, the parties shall proceed to select<br/>another arbitrator from the above list.</p>
<p>13.4.4 Limitations Upon the Arbitrator The arbitrator shall have no power to<br/>alter, amend, change, add to, or subtract from any of the terms of this<br/>Agreement, but shall determine only whether or not there has been a<br/>violation of this Agreement in the respect alleged in the grievance. In<br/>determining whether the District has violated an express term of this</p>
<p>-45-</p>
<p>Agreement, the standard of review for the arbitrator is to be whether<br/>the District acted in an arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory manner.<br/>The decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence<br/>and arguments presented to him/her by the respective parties in the<br/>presence of each other, and upon arguments presented in briefs. Ail<br/>evidence must be disclosed by the grievant prior to the conclusion of<br/>Formal Level II of the grievance procedure. If a grievant introduces<br/>new evidence at this step, the District may require that the grievance<br/>be returned to the prior step.</p>
<p>This Agreement constitutes a contract between the parties which shall<br/>be interpreted and applied by the parties and by the arbitrator in the<br/>same manner as any other contract under the laws of the State of<br/>California. The function and purpose of the arbitrator is to determine<br/>disputed interpretation of terms actually found in the Agreement, or to<br/>determine disputed facts upon which the application of the Agreement<br/>depends. The arbitrator shall therefore not have authority, nor shall<br/>he/she consider it his/her function to decide any issue not submitted or<br/>to so interpret or apply the Agreement as to change that can fairly be<br/>said to have been the intent of the parties as determined by generally<br/>accepted rules of contract construction. Past practice of the parties in<br/>interpreting or applying terms of this Agreement may be relevant<br/>evidence, but shall not be used so as to justify, or result in, what is, in<br/>effect, a modification (whether by addition or detraction) of the written<br/>terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not render any decision<br/>or award, or fail to render any decision or award, namely because in</p>

<p>13.4.6 The jurisdiction of the arbitrator shall not extend to matters of inherent<br/>managerial responsibility. In considering any issue in dispute, in its<br/>order, the arbitrator shall give due consideration to the statutory rights<br/>and obligations of this public school board to efficiently manage and<br/>conduct its operation within the legal limitations surrounding the<br/>financing of such operations. Further, the arbitrator shall have no<br/>power to change any practice, policy or rule of the Board nor to<br/>substitute his/her judgment for that of the Board as the reasonableness<br/>of any such practice, policy or any action taken by the Board.</p>
<p>13.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not imply any contractual restrictions and<br/>obligations upon the Board other than those expressly included in this<br/>Agreement. He/she shall give no opinion with respect to any matter<br/>left by this Agreement or by law to the discretion of the Board of<br/>Education or District Administration.</p>
<p>13.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not recommend any remedy in excess of $1,000<br/>nor shall he/she recommend punitive damages.</p>
<p>13.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to establish salary structures;<br/>recommend or resolve any matter involving evaluation, other than<br/>procedures; recommend or resolve any matter involving any claim or<br/>complaint for which there is another remedial procedure or course<br/>established by statute or by regulation having the force of law,<br/>including any matter specified in the Education Code.</p>
<p>13.4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive beyond the<br/>beginning of the last payroll period to the ten (10) day period specified</p>

<p>in Formal Level I of Ihe grievance procedure. The arbitrator shall have<br/>no power to render an award on any grievance occurring before thirty<br/>(30) days after the termination of this Agreement. The arbitrator may<br/>hear and determine only one grievance at a time unless the District<br/>expressly agrees otherwise. However, for purposes of efficiency, the<br/>District or its representatives may consolidate grievances involving<br/>similar cases.</p>
<p>13.4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall complete his/her efforts and provide a decision to<br/>the Board and Association within sixty (60) days of the arbitrator's<br/>agreement to hear the case.</p>
<p>13.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitrator's Decision, Board Review. The decision of the arbitrator<br/>within the limits herein prescribed shall be in written form of a<br/>recommendation to the Board of Education.</p>
<p>Formal Level IV</p>
<p>13.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the second scheduled board meeting, following the<br/>receipt of the arbitrator's written recommendations, the Board shall<br/>render a decision on the matter, which decision shall be final and<br/>binding on all parties. The Board may undertake review of the entire<br/>hearing record and briefs. The Board may, if it deems appropriate,<br/>permit oral arguments by representatives of the parties, but only in the<br/>presence of one another.</p>
<p>13.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where the arbitrator's award sustains the grievant, but the<br/>Board subsequently fails to accept such recommendation and instead<br/>modifies or reverses the arbitrator's decision, and the grievant later<br/>files a judicial action against the District for breach of Agreement, the</p>

<p>District shall not assert as a defense that the grievant’s utilization of the<br/>grievance and arbitration procedure was the only proper remedy for the<br/>resolution of the grievance. In all other cases, the grievance and<br/>arbitration procedure described above is to be the Association’s and<br/>Unit Member’s sole and final remedy for any claimed breach of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>13.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenses. If the Board totally denies the arbitrator's recommendations,<br/>the Board will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses. If the Board<br/>accepts or modifies the arbitrator's recommendations, all fees and<br/>expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties. Each<br/>party shall bear the expenses of the presentation of its own case.</p>
<p>13.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in exercising this right, the Association President or designee will<br/>contact orally the Superintendent within twenty (20) duty days after the<br/>Association President or his/her designee knew or should have known<br/>of the act or condition. If not so presented, the Association's right to<br/>grieve will be waived.</p>

<p>14.3 Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>14.3.1 Every Member of the Unit is entitled to a leave of absence, not to<br/>exceed three (3) days of leave if travel is within California, four (4) days<br/>if beyond five hundred (500) miles one way distance within the state,<br/>and six (6) days if out of state is required on account of death of any<br/>member of the immediate family.

Permission to use this<br/>policy for other relatives because of extenuating circumstances may be<br/>granted by the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>14.4.1 The District and the Association hereby acknowledge that the District’s<br/>certificated employees provide the District’s students with professional<br/>instructional services. In order to assist the District’s certificated<br/>employees with their challenging professional tasks,- the District and<br/>the Association agree to utilize the provisions of Ed Code 44981,<br/>which provide for the use of personal necessity leave. At the<br/>discretion of the Unit Member and subject to the guidelines in this<br/>Contract and Ed Code 44981, each full-time Unit Member shall be<br/>entitled to use up to seven (7) days of personal necessity leave during<br/>each school year. Part-time Unit Members are entitled to<br/>proportionate use of personal necessity leave. Personal necessity<br/>leave cannot be carried over from year to year.</p>
<p>14.4.2 Personal necessity leave may be used by Unit Members for compelling<br/>special and unusual circumstances of a personal nature which cannot<br/>be disregarded and which cannot be dealt with during nonduty hours.</p>
<p>14.4.2.1 Unit Members may not use personal necessity leave to<br/>provide substitute teacher services in other school districts.</p>
<p>14.4.2.2 Personal necessity leave must be used in increments of<br/>one-half days (or more).</p>
<p>Only Unit Members who have unused sick leave credit are eligible to<br/>utilize the personal necessity leave provisions in this contract.</p>
<p>In normal circumstances, Unit Members shall submit written requests<br/>for personal necessity leave to his/her supervisor. The supervisor shall<br/>notify the Unit Member of the approval or denial of the request within<br/>five (5) duty days.</p>
<p>Prior approval of the supervisor is not necessary for:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation problems which make it impossible for the Unit<br/>Member to get to work (e.g., inclement weather, mechanical<br/>breakdown, auto accident, etc.).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accidents involving the employee’s person or property. Accidents<br/>are incidents of a serious nature which require the immediate<br/>attendance of the Unit Member. Such events as fire, flood,<br/>burglary, and crimes qualify for personal necessity leave.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any compelling special and unusual circumstance of a personal<br/>nature which cannot be disregarded and for which prior approval<br/>cannot be provided.</p>
<p>When Unit Members use personal necessity leave and the supervisor<br/>is not notified in advance, then the Unit Member agrees to make every<br/>reasonable effort to comply with district procedures to secure a<br/>substitute teacher and to notify the supervisor of the expected duration<br/>of the absences.</p>
<p>Unit members who are absent from duty because of personal<br/>necessity shall report the use of personal necessity leave on district<br/>approved forms.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature/urgency of the request compared to other requests for<br/>uncompensated leaves.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment record of the Unit Member making the request for an<br/>extension.</p>
<p>If the Unit Member is granted an extension of an uncompensated leave<br/>(for a second consecutive year), the Unit Member will be provided with<br/>the following options at the conclusion of the second consecutive year<br/>of uncompensated leave:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to full-time status.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request that the part-time status (at least 50%) become<br/>permanent which includes a benefits package pursuant to Article</p>

<p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previously held. Course credit obtained during uncompensated leave</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be applied toward credit on the certificated salary schedule.</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on full-time uncompensated leave, an employee shall be entitled</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the same insurance benefits provided to other Unit Members,</p>
<p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided the Unit Member pays the premiums and remains eligible</p>
<p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the terms of the insurance carrier.</p>
<p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.6.B Family Care Leave</p>
<p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to provide Members of the Bargaining Unit who</p>
<p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have more than one year of continuous service, up to four months</p>
<p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(within a 24 month period of time) of unpaid family care leave as</p>
<p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and</p>
<p>14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California Family Rights Act (CFRA). The Family Care Leave applies</p>
<p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only to leaves of absence for:</p>
<p>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The birth of a child of the employee, adoption of a child or serious</p>

<p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To care for a parent or a spouse who has a serious health condition.</p>
<p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to request notification from a licensed</p>
<p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physician or legal officer in the event the employee chooses to use the</p>
<p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provisions of the Family Care Leave section. The District recognizes</p>
<p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that California Government Code section 12945.2(s) expressly</p>
<p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provides that an employee’s entitlement to leave for disability on</p>
<p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions runs</p>
<p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consecutively, not concurrently, with leave under the CFRA.</p>

<p>selected for jury duty, the District agrees to provide the Unit<br/>Member with written notification to the appropriate court<br/>requesting that the Unit Member’s jury duty be postponed to<br/>non-duty days.</p>
<p>14.8.2.2 Unit members who are successful in postponing jury duty<br/>from the regular contract year to non-duty days shall be<br/>reimbursed with a stipend equivalent to the daily cost of a<br/>substitute teacher for up to five days of jury duty which is<br/>actually served during the non-duty days (instead of during<br/>the school year). The District agrees to make this jury duty<br/>stipend payment after the Unit Member provides<br/>documentation/evidence from the court that the Unit<br/>Member postponed jury duty service and actually served the<br/>jury duty during the non-duty days.</p>
<p>Compensatory Time</p>
<p>14.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated staff may earn compensatory (comp) time in the following</p>
<p>ways:</p>

<p>c. By voluntarily serving as a lunch time supervisor at the request<br/>of the site administrator.</p>
<p>14.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated staff accrue comp time in 15 minute units (15 minutes of</p>

<p>Comp time leaves, under normal circumstances, may be used for not<br/>less than half-day absences. Approval of requests for comp time<br/>leaves for iess than half-day is up to the discretion of the site<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>Any Unit Member who applies for a comp day must have earned the<br/>comp time units in advance of the proposed comp day.</p>
<p>Comp time units are not transferable among Unit Members.</p>
<p>Site administrators may not schedule two Unit Members for comp time<br/>leave on the same school day.</p>
<p>Unit Members and the District agree to use Appendix “K” to record all<br/>comp time units.</p>
<p>The District will not provide cash value for accrued comp time in the<br/>event an employee resigns, retires, is promoted, or otherwise leaves<br/>the employment of the District.</p>
<p>Comp time units may be accrued from year to year and are transferable<br/>across sites.</p>
<p>If the District wishes to negotiate the cancellation of the comp time<br/>program, the District agrees to provide the Association with one (1)<br/>calendar year notice.</p>

<p>14.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose: The purpose of the Catastrophic Leave Bank (CLB) is to<br/>create a bank of sick leave days from which eligible unit members may<br/>apply for additional sick leave days when suffering from catastrophic<br/>illness or injury.</p>
<p>14.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility: Use of this CLB shall be available to all unit members who<br/>have made an annual donation of at least one day to the Bank. Unit<br/>members who elect not to join the Bank upon first becoming eligible<br/>shall have a waiting period of thirty (30) days after contributing to the<br/>Bank before becoming eligible to withdraw.</p>
<p>14.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations:</p>
<p>14.10.4.1 All donations made by unit members shall be voluntary and<br/>are irrevocable. Contributions shall be donated by the last<br/>duty day in September of each year. At the beginning of<br/>the donation period, the Personnel office shall send to each<br/>unit member a notice outlining the CLB and a “Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank Donation Form” (Appendix R).</p>
<p>14/10.4.2 Unit members may contribute a maximum of two (2) days<br/>in any one year.</p>
<p>14.10.4.3 A donation to the Bank shall be a general donation, and<br/>shall not be donated to a specific unit member for his/her<br/>exclusive use.</p>
<p>14/10.4.4 All donations are irrevocable, and the unit member waives<br/>any right to leave credits he/she may have donated except</p>

<p>14.10.4.5 The Executive Board of JDUTA shall, by June 30<sup>th</sup> of each<br/>year, review the number of days remaining in the CLB, and<br/>should it determine it its judgment that a sufficient number<br/>of days are present in the bank, shall be authorized to<br/>waive the requirement for an annual donation in the<br/>upcoming year for those unit members who have made<br/>donations in the current year.</p>
<p>14.10.5 Use of the Catastrophic Leave Bank (CLB)</p>
<p>Eligible unit members who suffer a catastrophic illness or injury as<br/>defined herein, may request withdrawal of leave credits from the Bank<br/>under the following terms:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit, member has or will have exhausted all accumulated<br/>leaves (prior to utilization of differential pay) by the time of the<br/>actual withdrawal.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has submitted a Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>Withdrawal Form (Appendix S) in writing to the chair of the CLB<br/>Committee with a copy to the Payroll office, and include the<br/>following detail:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written verification of the catastrophic illness or injury by a<br/>medical doctor.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific number of days being requested.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Payroll office shall verify the unit member requesting the<br/>withdrawal has exhausted all paid leave, or date when this will</p>
<p>-65 -</p>
<p>occur.</p>
<p>The Ghair shall convene the CLB Committee as soon as possible<br/>to consider the withdrawal request.</p>
<p>Withdrawals may be granted in units of no more than ten (10)<br/>duty days. Participants may request extensions or additional<br/>days as their grants expire. The maximum withdrawal of leave<br/>credits for an individual unit member in a given fiscal year shall<br/>not exceed fifty (50) days. In no event shall more than 150 days<br/>be withdrawn from the bank during one fiscal year.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have exhausted accrued paid leave,<br/>but still have differential leave available, are eligible for a<br/>withdrawal from the CLB. When a unit member is eligible<br/>for, and utilizes, both the CLB and differential leave, the<br/>District shall pay the unit member full pay and the CLB shall<br/>be charged one-half (1/2) day for each day of differential<br/>leave used.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the unit member has also exhausted differential<br/>leave, the employee shall be placed on the 39-month<br/>reemployment list pursuant to Article 14.1.9.</p>
<p>All information shall be held confidential by the CLB Committee<br/>and the District.</p>
<p>Any days approved by the CLB Committee that are unused by<br/>the unit member shall be returned to the Bank upon the unit</p>
<p>member’s return to work.</p>

<p>The District counter-proposes the following changes in the contract while facing the reality of an<br/>unprecedented fiscal crisis that requires immediate action in order to preserve the organization,<br/>provide budget flexibility, save jobs, and prevent the breakdown of public education in this<br/>community.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reduction in the 2009-2010 employee workyear of four (4) days, with a corresponding<br/>reduction in employee salaries;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should state legislation be enacted allowing for a reduction in the number of student<br/>instructional days, a further corresponding reduction in the number of duty days for unit<br/>members, up to a maximum of five (5), shall occur for the 2009-2010. The District and JDUTA<br/>agree to defer discussion on this topic;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2009-2010 school year only, the maximum district contribution toward the cost of<br/>health and welfare benefits shall not exceed $6,000;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide a $500.00 bonus to any fulltime unit member who, prior to<br/>August 14, 2009, submits an irrevocable written resignation with an effective date of the last day<br/>of school in June, 2010. This amount will be prorated for unit members working less than 1.0<br/>FTE.</p>
<p>The District desires to reinstate as many laid-off employees as possible; however, this<br/>determination will be based upon factors that include actual student attendance, mid-year budget<br/>cuts (iLany), and other fiscal considerations.</p>
