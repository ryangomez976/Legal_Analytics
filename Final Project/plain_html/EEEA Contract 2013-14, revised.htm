<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitrator's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision will be in writing and will set forth the finding of fact, reasoning and conclusions of the</p>
<p>issues submitted. The arbitrator will be without power or authority to make any decision which requires the<br/>commission of an act prohibited by law or which is violative of the specific terms of this Agreement, The<br/>decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the Association and the Superintendent and will be final and<br/>binding upon the parties. If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such question will be<br/>ruled upon by the arbitrator.</p>

<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosophical objector terminates his/her employment voluntarily and is then re-employed by the District in a<br/>certificated bargaining unit position.</p>
<p>If a philosophical objectors employment is involuntarily terminated then re-employed, the following conditions apply:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a permanent employee, who has been granted philosophical objector status, experiences layoff, he/she shall retain</p>
<p>the right to submit a request for continued exemption within 30 days of reinstatement, if such reinstatement is within 36<br/>months of the effective date of layoff.</p>

The District shall make every reasonable effort to<br/>secure the services of a substitute employee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of subdivision a:</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Governing Board shall adopt a salary schedule for substitute employees.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a certificated employee has exhausted all available sick leave, including accumulated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick</p>
<p>leave, and continues to be absent on account of illness or accident for a period beyond the five-month</p>
<p>period provided for herein, and the employee is not medically able to resume the duties of his or her<br/>position, the employee shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a reemployment list for a<br/>period of 24 months if the employee is on probationary status, or for a period of 39 months if the<br/>employee is on permanent status. When the employee is medically able, during the 24- or 39-month<br/>period, the certificated employee shall be returned to employment in a position for which he or she is<br/>credentialed and qualified.

Provided the employee continues to receive temporary<br/>disability indemnity, he/she is entitled to take only as much of his/her accumulated sick leave which, when<br/>added to his/her temporary disability indemnity, will result in payment to him/her of not more than his/her full<br/>salary.</p>

<p>8. Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>a, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Catastrophic Illness/Sick Leave Bank is to create a bank of sick leave days from which<br/>participants may apply for additional sick leave days when suffering from catastrophic illness or event and<br/>have exhausted all other paid leave.</p>
<p>b, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illness”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mean an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate an employee for</p>
<p>an extended period of time, and the incapacity requires the employee to take time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time.

<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day during each contribution period.</p>
<p>2} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least twenty (20) days of accrued sick leave to make a donation.</p>

<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;donation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bank will be a general donation and shall not be donated to a specific employee</p>
<p>for his/her exclusive use.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be made between September 1 and December 1 of each school year. Employees</p>
<p>returning from an extended leave, which included the enrollment period, will be permitted to<br/>contribute within 30 calendar days of beginning work.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contribution shall be solicited from within the bargaining unit if the number of days</p>
<p>in the Catastrophic Leave Bank fall below 250 or fifty percent of the initial contribution totals,<br/>whichever is greater.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only employees who have donated to the bank may apply to withdraw days from the bank. The Sick Leave<br/>Bank Review Committee may waive this provision for employees who are suffering from a catastrophic illness<br/>at the time this Agreement is adopted and, because of that, do not qualify to make a donation.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only employees (or their agents) may apply to use the bank by submitting their request to the Sick Leave Bank<br/>Review Committee using the appropriate District form (Appendix G).

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sick Leave Bank Review Committee will consist of two (2) employees appointed by the Association and one<br/>(1) management representative appointed by the District.

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions/Exclusions/Miscellaneous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request a maximum of twenty (20) days per application, At the end of the twenty<br/>(20) day period, an additional twenty (20) days may be requested for a maximum of forty (40)<br/>days to be used per catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used will be returned to the bank. One (1) day used will be equal to one (1)</p>
<p>day at the employee's per diem rate of pay.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;granted under this agreement will be coordinated with the extended illness leave provision to</p>
<p>create a full day of wages. The sick leave bank will be debited one-half (1 /2) day for each day<br/>used.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bank may not be used for illness or disability that qualified the employee for worker</p>

<p>a disability award or retirement under STRS, the committee may request the employee apply for<br/>disability or retirement benefits. Failure of the employee to submit a complete application within<br/>twenty (20) days of the request shall disqualify the employee from further catastrophic leave bank<br/>payments.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By July 1 of each year the balance in the bank will be reconciled to ensure the number of days in the<br/>bank is equal to the number of current active donations. The Association will be notified of the<br/>balance.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will be reviewed annually and the parties may mutually agree to make appropriate<br/>modifications to this program in writing.</p>

<p>Catastrophic Illness/Sick Leave Request Form</p>
<p>The purpose of the Catastrophic Illness/Sick Leave Bank is to create a bank of sick leave days from which participants may apply for additional sick<br/>leave when suffering from catastrophic illness or accident and have exhausted all other paid leave.</p>
<p>“Catastrophic illness&quot; is defined to mean an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate an employee for an extended period of time, and the<br/>incapacity requires the employees to take time off from work for an extended period of time, An employee suffering from a catastrophic illness or<br/>injury shall provide verification by means of a letter, dated and signed by the ill or injured person’s licensed physician of the State of California,<br/>indicating the Incapacitating nature and probable duration of illness or injury.</p>
<p>Only employees (or their agents) may apply to use the bank by submitting their request to the Sick Leave Bank Review Committee using the<br/>appropriate District form, included with the form will be verification of the catastrophic illness prepared, in writing, by a licensed physician of the<br/>State of California.</p>
<p>The Sick Leave Bank Review Committee will consist of two (2) employees appointed by the Association and one (1) management representative appointed<br/>by the District. The committee will review all applications. Approval of any request will require a majority vote of the committee. The decision of the<br/>committee shall be final and binding. Within ten (10) duty days of receipt of employee application, the committee will notify, in writing, the applicant of<br/>its decision. All applications submitted to the committee shall remain confidential.</p>
<p>An employee may request a maximum of twenty (20) days per application. At the end of the twenty (20) day period, an additional twenty (20) days<br/>may be requested for a maximum of forty (40) days to be used per catastrophic event.</p>
<p>Days granted but not used will be returned to the bank. One (1) day used will be equal to one (1) day at the employee's per diem rate of pay.</p>
<p>Leave granted under this agreement will be coordinated with the extended illness leave provision to create a full day of wages. The sick leave bank<br/>will be debited one-half (1 /2) day for each day used.</p>
<p>Leave from the bank may not be used for illness or disability that qualified the employee for workers' compensation benefits.</p>
<p>When the Sick Leave Bank Review Committee reasonably presumes the applicant may be eligible for a disability award or retirement under STRS, the<br/>committee may request the employee apply for disability or retirement benefits. Failure of the employee to submit a complete application within<br/>twenty (20) days of the request shall disqualify the employee from further catastrophic leave bank payments.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any K-5 (and 6th grade self-contained at K-8 schools) that exceeds thirty-two (32) students shall receive District-provided<br/>assistance within two (2) days of the impact such as: trained aides, clerical assistance, a temporary class, or other appropriate<br/>relief. The site administrator shall solicit input from the teacher impacted by the overage as to the desired District-provided<br/>assistance.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer shall be defined as the movement of an employee to a different site and may be employee or district<br/>initiated.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassignment is the assignment of an employee from one certificated bargaining unit position to another at the same<br/>site.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy is a position that becomes available due to a long-term leave of absence, resignation, or is a newly created<br/>position.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this section, “posting&quot; will mean that the job title and job details will be posted at each school site<br/>in a conspicuous location as well as the District website for the period of time as referred in C.1 Posting of Vacancies.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a vacancy occurs at a school site, first consideration shall be given to on-site employees.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a vacancy occurs after the beginning of the school year and an internal transfer is not facilitated at that time, the<br/>vacancy will be filled with an employee temporarily assigned to the position. Vacancies will be posted on site prior to<br/>the beginning of the subsequent school year pursuant to Section B.l.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are not reassigned to the requested position will, upon request, be given written notice stating the<br/>reason(s) for non-selection within five (5) days of the request for written notice.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting of Vacancies</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occurring: 1) during the traditional summer break, 2) in the spring prior to the subsequent school</p>
<p>year, or 3) due to special assignment position during the school year, shall be posted at each school site (as<br/>defined in A.4) for five (5) contractual days.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that occur three (3) calendar weeks prior to the start of the instructional school year shall be posted</p>
<p>for three (3) contractual days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No assignment to fill the vacancy shall be made prior to the closing date of the posting period.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee-Initiated Transfer</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be considered for a transfer to a posted vacancy, the employee shall complete the transfer request form and submit<br/>it to the District during the posting period.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the determination of a request(s) for an employee-initiated transfer, the wishes of the individual employee shall be<br/>honored by considering the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the needs of the students to be served</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the needs and efficient operation of the district</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and professional needs of the unit member</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seniority&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the district</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two (2) or more permanent certificated employees put in a transfer request they will be contacted and offered an</p>
<p>opportunity for an interview for any site openings for which they are qualified, prior to the consideration of external<br/>candidates.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No such transfer request shall be denied arbitrarily, capriciously or without basis in fact.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is denied a transfer pursuant to Section C and D may request, and will be granted, a meeting with<br/>the administrator to discuss the issue. In addition, employees who are not reassigned to the requested position will, upon<br/>request, be given written notice stating the reason(s) for non-selection within five (5) days of the request for written<br/>notice.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for transfer is without prejudice to the employee and shall not jeopardize the present assignment.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a permanent employee has consistently applied for a transfer for at least two years and has not been successful, the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources, may be contacted by the employee to discuss the transfer result.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer list(s) sent to supervisors of certificated personnel will also be sent to the EEEA President.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-Initiated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of District-initiated transfers for the coming school year shall be given in writing to the employees as soon as<br/>practical and normally no later than fifteen (15) contractual days before the end of the school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of intent to invoke a District-initiated transfer during the school year shall be given in writing to the employee as<br/>soon as possible.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District-initiated transfer shall be based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the needs of students to be served with an explanation</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the needs and efficient operation of the district</p>
<p>c, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the preference of the employee</p>
<p>d, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change in enrollment</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee shall be involuntarily transferred for the reasons specified in 3,a through d. above, if there is a voluntary<br/>transfer applicant who is qualified and competent to fill the position and whose transfer would negate the need for an<br/>involuntary transfer of another employee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee being involuntarily transferred pursuant to Section 3.a and d, shall be given first consideration with regard<br/>to choice among vacant positions for which he/she is qualified, over those seeking a voluntary transfer.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District-initiated transfer shall be made only after a meeting between the employee and the appropriate District<br/>Office or site administrator, At such time the employee, upon written request, shall be given written reason(s). A good<br/>faith effort to find alternate solutions to the problems will be made by the administration if the employee objects to the<br/>transfer on the basis of the reasons provided at this meeting.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee is involuntarily transferred, such transfer shall not occur prior to two (2) contractual days following the<br/>meeting with the District Office or site administrator when the transfer is between three (3) calendar weeks before the<br/>start of the instructional school year and during the first four (4) instructional weeks. An involuntarily transfer which<br/>occurs outside of the above period shall not occur prior to five (5) contractual days after the meeting with the District<br/>Office or site administrator, unless there is agreement to implement in a shorter time frame.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the District will provide assistance with lifting and moving materials from the present work location to the<br/>new location. In addition, a substitute will be provided for one day for the move at the transfer employee’s discretion in<br/>collaboration with the site administrator. If additional release time or assistance is needed, then the employee may<br/>contact the site administrator and/or Human Resources to consider individual circumstances.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any District-initiated transfers based on a change in enrollment in which there is no voluntary transfer applicant as<br/>defined in E.4 and the employee to be transferred is not the least senior at the site, then the reason for the selection shall<br/>not be arbitrary or capricious.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid-Year Transfer</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if vacancies occur after the beginning of the school year, these vacancies will not be posted for that school year and<br/>shall be filled with an employee temporarily assigned to that position. Such vacancies will be posted for the subsequent<br/>school year after site reassignment procedures as outlined in Section B,</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special assignment positions may be posted for permanent transfer.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intention of Retire</p>
<p>Following formal acceptance by the superintendent of an official retirement statement and notice of resignation submitted by an<br/>employee, said employee shall not be involuntarily transferred during his/her last year of employment in the District.</p>

It is understood and agreed that the fifteen percent (15%) limitation is a guideline and should be seen as<br/>flexible to accommodate specific employee and District needs.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levels&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who have been employed by the district for less than ten (10) years shall be</p>
<p>evaluated at least every other year. If the most recent evaluation reflects an Unsatisfactory ranking in any<br/>element, the employee may be evaluated the subsequent year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who have been employed by the District for at least ten (10) years may be</p>
<p>evaluated every three years instead of every other year if:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the employee received a satisfactory evaluation during the previous evaluation cycle.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee is deemed highly qualified under the No Child Left Behind Act.</p>

<p>By request of the evaluator or the employee, the employee will be returned to the evaluation cycle of every other<br/>year. Upon receipt of a non-satisfactory evaluation, the employee will be returned to the annual evaluation cycle.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements, and Ratings - Temporary and Probationary</p>
<p>MfiJoyees</p>
<p>ct. SPERS 166a and 166b, Certificated Professional Evaluation: Objectives and Observations/Probationary<br/>and Temporary employees, shall be used by all employees in probationary or temporary status.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ail&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in each Standard shall be addressed during the evaluation period.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall determine, in consultation with the employee, the order and timing of the introduction of</p>
<p>elements as the year progresses.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are the foundation of the observations and feedback, and cumulatively, for the Summative</p>
<p>evaluations. They are intended to be observed in the classroom and other appropriate observational<br/>environments, and do not constitute projects for the employee to develop outside of the instructional process.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mid-point of the employee's school year, the evaluator shall meet with the employee to discuss the</p>
<p>status of progress in achieving elements, standards, and other evaluative criteria. The midyear assessment<br/>will be formalized using SPERS 1 66a.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probationary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee’s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;status&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question, the immediate supervisor shall request that the</p>
<p>PAR Panel provide to the employee the assistance of a consulting teacher. This provision shall not supplant the<br/>statutory right of the Board of Trustees to make its final determination of retention or non-reemployment of the<br/>probationary employee. However, the employee may opt to submit a resignation from his/her position for<br/>consideration by the Board.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the final evaluation, the evaluator shall rate each element in each Standard. The summary of such</p>
<p>ratings shall constitute the rating of each Standard.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the following, which are defined on Rubrics which shall be given to each employee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>Practice Not Consistent with Standard Expectations, 2. Developing Beginning Practice, 3. Maturing Beginning<br/>Practice, 4. Experienced Practice that Exemplifies the Standard,</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rating of 1 (Practice Not Consistent with Standard Expectations) in two elements in a Standard will result</p>
<p>in a rating of Practice Not Consistent with Standard Expectation in the overall Standard. SPERS 166a shall<br/>be used for the Midyear/Final Evaluations.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Evaluation Standards, Elements, and Ratings - Permanent Employees</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPERS 166a and 166b, Certificated Professional Evaluation: Objectives and Observations/Permanent<br/>Employee, shall be used by all employees in permanent status except XIV D,</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements 5.6, 6.5 and 6.6 are mandatory for all evaluatees, In addition, each evaluatee shall be<br/>responsible for selecting a minimum of one (1) element within Standards 1 through 4. In specific situations,<br/>based upon an individual evaluatee’s performance, nothing herein shall prevent the evaluator, after<br/>collaboration with the employee, from including additional elements. Under those circumstances a maximum<br/>of 15 elements which includes the 3 mandatory elements 5.6, 6.5, and 6.6 may be identified on which the<br/>Summative evaluation will take place.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elements are the foundation of the observations and feedback, and cumulatively for the Summative<br/>evaluations. They are intended to be observed in the classroom and other appropriate observational<br/>environments, and do not constitute projects for the teacher to develop outside of the instructional process,</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the evaluation period, mitigating circumstances may arise which require modification of<br/>the Elements selected (i.e., adding additional Elements to reflect exemplary practice or areas of need for<br/>focus.) The evaluator may determine additional elements after collaboration with the evaluatee.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the mid-point of the employee's school year, the evaluator may meet with the employee to discuss the status<br/>of progress in achieving Elements and Standards and other evaluative criteria.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a permanent employee experiences performance difficulties the supervisor may suggest to the<br/>employee the option of voluntarily participating in PAR.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of the Summative, year-end evaluation, the evaluator shall rate the employee’s<br/>performance on the Elements selected, including those required and those added during the year, and shall<br/>use those ratings to rate each Standard,</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratings consist of: 1. Unsatisfactory, 2. Need Improvement, 3. Meets District Standards, 4. Exemplifies<br/>Standards.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rating of Unsatisfactory in two Elements in a Standard shall result in the overall Standard being rated as<br/>unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unsatisfactory rating of three or more Standards shall result in an overall unsatisfactory evaluation. If the<br/>three unsatisfactory ratings are in Standards one through five for a total of any six elements in Standards<br/>one through five are rated as unsatisfactory, the evaluation shall be referred to the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Panel for required participation in PAR the following year,</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee who is to be evaluated shall be furnished a copy of the evaluation forms and procedures,<br/>including the Rubrics which describe the Elements in each Standard and the ratings thereof, and be notified<br/>of the identity of their primary evaluator, no later than the tenth (10th) contractual day of the year in which<br/>the evaluation is to take place. In case of a multiple-campus assignment, the District shall designate an<br/>evaluator for such employee. Such employees may be observed by the supervisor at any site served, and<br/>said observation shall be included in the year-end evaluation.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within fifteen (1 5) contractual working days of the beginning of the individual employee’s school year, each<br/>employee who is being evaluated shall propose to the evaluator specific Elements within each Standard to<br/>begin with (probs and temps) or to be the foundation for the evaluation (permanent teachers).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) contractual days of the beginning of the individual employee's school year, the evaluator<br/>and evaluatee shall meet to discuss and finalize the Elements as discussed in (3c) above.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluator and evaluatee shall confer about problem areas in the employee's performance within ten</p>
<p>(10) contractual days of said problem identification and prior to any negative comments or judgments<br/>related to routine classroom deficiencies being included in the final evaluation.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;later than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the end of the employee’s school year, the evaluatee</p>
<p>shall verify the status of achieving a demonstration of the Elements identified for that year.</p>
<p>In preparing the final evaluation rating for placement in the employee's personnel file, the evaluator shall<br/>rely primarily upon data collected and documented through classroom observations and<br/>observation/evaluation or performance conferences that have been previously presented to the unit member<br/>in writing in either memo or letter form or on the copy of the “Objectives and Observation” form. Any<br/>deficiencies, which may have been presented to the employee in writing, may be reflected in the rating of<br/>the relevant Elements. Those that have been corrected or improved shall be so reflected in the ratings.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation ratings shall be summarized and presented to the employee at an evaluation conference no</p>
<p>later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the end of the instructional school year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District will meet outside of negotiations to address changes to evaluation documents for</p>
<p>nurses and counselors.</p>
<p>The revised evaluation forms for School Psychologist, Resource Specialists, Designated Instruction Service Providers,<br/>Itinerant Teachers, and Teachers on Special Assignment will be implemented beginning with the 2005-06 school year.<br/>The Association and District agree to review and modify outside of current negotiations, during the 2004-05 school<br/>year, evaluation documents currently utilized by Nurses and Counselors.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and temporary employees shall be formally observed at least twice annually. Permanent employees who</p>
<p>are being formally evaluated shall be formally observed at least one (1) time annually. Formal observations shall be<br/>based on no fewer than fifteen (15) minutes of consecutive classroom time.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that deficient performance is noted in an observation of fewer than fifteen (15) minutes, such circumstances<br/>will be quickly brought to the employee’s attention. If deemed serious, the matter shall be provided in writing to the<br/>employee and shall result in a formal observation by the administrator within five (5) contractual days.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a negative observation(s), the evaluator shall meet with the employee within five (5) contractual days to<br/>discuss the observation. If deemed serious, the matter shall be provided in writing to the employee. This written<br/>statement shall include but not be limited to the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific recommendations for improvement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assistance to implement such recommendations including additional observations.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Techniques to measure improvement.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strictly voluntary and is available to employees who have completed at least three (3) years consecutive</p>
<p>experience in the Escondido Union School District and have achieved permanent status. This is in lieu of the standard<br/>evaluation form,</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discussion regarding an employee's participation may originate with either the immediate supervisor or the</p>
<p>employee.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision as to whether or not the employee may voluntarily participate in the alternative evaluation<br/>program is solely that of the immediate supervisor, and is not subject to grievance,</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form, see Article XIV,</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objectives may be limited to a specific area in which the employee has a desire to focus</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectives form will be filled out by the employee and will reflect the mutual agreement of the</p>
<p>employee and the immediate supervisor as to the focus, criteria, and means of evaluation of the employee's<br/>objectives.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of the Goals and Objectives as well as the number of observations, midyear</p>
<p>and final evaluations shall remain the same as the standard evaluation.</p>
<p>3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who participates in the Alternative Evaluation Program will be encouraged to meet and share their project<br/>with other district employees at least once during the evaluation procedure.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Data Related to Evaluation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not base any adverse action against an employee upon derogatory materials which are not contained<br/>in such employee's personnel file.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right to review personnel file materials, which Include ratings, reports or records which:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were obtained prior to the employment of the employee,</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were prepared by identifiable examination committee members, or</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVI<br/>EMPLOYEE BENEFITS</p>
<p>Health and Welfare Benefits</p>
<p>The District and the Association are committed to maintaining a quality health and welfare program. The parties agree to a good faith<br/>effort and commitment to maintain a program, which is comprehensive and cost-effective. Subject to the provisions of this article, the<br/>employer shall, for the duration of this agreement, provide Health care benefits for eligible employees as specified within the master<br/>insurance contract between the District and the respective insurance carriers the District selects,</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Insurance Carriers</p>
<p>Health care benefits shall be provided by the District through participation in the San Diego County Schools Fringe Benefit<br/>Consortium as described in Part D, below and VEBA unless modified or changed through the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and Association recognize the impact of escalating health insurance premiums upon the total compensation package,<br/>In an effort to analyze, understand and reduce the escalation of these costs, an Insurance Committee shall be established and<br/>shall meet on a regular basis, monthly for the first six (6) months and at least quarterly thereafter. The Insurance Committee shall<br/>be comprised of up to three (3) representatives from the Association. No other employee group will have more than three (3)<br/>representatives.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of the Insurance Committee Is to review the cost trends in the District’s carriers, program structure, and<br/>benefit plans.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Insurance Committee shall have the authority to analyze how the current carriers, program structures, and benefit<br/>plans are impacting costs, to explore options which may reduce costs or rates of increase in costs, and to make<br/>recommendations to the District regarding potential adjustments. This committee is an advisory body only. All relevant<br/>information requested by the committee that pertains to the Committee’s responsibility shall be provided within a<br/>reasonable time frame and shared with the committee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage Defined</p>
<p>“Full Coverage&quot; shall include:</p>
<p>Employee and dependent medical insurance</p>
<p>D. Employee only, basic life for $50,000<br/>Employee only, vision</p>
<p>Employee only dental, or an alternative HMO family dental plan</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringe Benefit Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coverage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the District will be provided by Delta Dental for employees only, or DeltaCare/PMI for</p>
<p>family coverage.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coverage,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall continue to be offered through VSP.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insurance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only, shall continue to be offered.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;program&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;described&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this paragraph D. will be provided by the Fringe Benefit Consortium.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Contribution</p>
<p>1. Effective the first full pay period following ratification by the Association, for the duration of this agreement the District annual<br/>contribution for fully benefited employees shall be determined by the actual 201 3 benefit plan selected. Contributions and plans are listed<br/>on rate sheet 1 -B 2013 Rates — Without Opt-Out Subsidy, dated October 24, 201 3 (See attached)</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>(Note — The tiered distribution listed in the above rate sheet is an approximate equivalent to increasing the cap up to an average of<br/>$11,1 38 per benefited employee for a total district health and welfare contribution of $ 1 5, 246,831)</p>
<p>The district annual contribution for employees who are eligible for full benefits and who voluntarily elect to waive all insurance coverage<br/>will remain at $10,000. This annual contribution shall be applied to benefits for the 2014 plan year only, as described in the Side Letter<br/>of Agreement dated October 16, 201 2.</p>
<p>2. For the 2014 health benefits plan year the equivalent of 1% salary increase shall be applied one time only to the District contribution<br/>for employee benefits described in Article XVI.E.l. The use of these one-time funds is non-precedential, will not bind the parties to any<br/>future action under similar conditions and cannot be introduced in any grievance, arbitration, complaint, administrative or legal proceeding<br/>as evidence of the status quo, past practice, or intent of the parties or meaning or application of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The<br/>benefits and obligations set forth herein may be extended beyond the 2014 plan year only by the express, written agreement of the<br/>parties. The Association further agrees to mutually draft, release, and fully support without reservation at least three joint communiques to<br/>all EUSD staff that contain the language stated in this section. At least one joint communique will be released October of 2014,</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Eligibility</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time Employees</p>
<p>Employees who work less than full time in a certificated position shall receive a straight proration of the District's<br/>contribution toward the insurance benefits, as compared to a full-time certificated employee. Example: A half-time<br/>teacher would receive 50% of the District's contribution for insurance benefits,</p>
<p>Part-time employees who were employed in the District prior to June 30, 1 987, shall continue to receive the same level<br/>of benefits they received during the 1986-87 school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees</p>
<p>Employees who retire on or after age 55 with ten (10) or more years of service with the District shall be eligible to<br/>have the least costly basic medical insurance plan that is offered to employees continued by the District until the<br/>employee becomes covered by Medicare or attains age 65, whichever is first. During this period of eligibility, the<br/>retiree, however, may elect to continue in any plan offered to current employees provided the retiree pays any<br/>additional premium cost. The retiree shall remit the difference between the District contribution and the total premium<br/>cost to the Personnel Office on the due date designated by the District. Any payment required shall be by Cashier's<br/>Check, Certified Check, or Money Order. The retiree shall complete all District required insurance forms. The District<br/>pays only the dollar amount equivalent to the above percentage for the HMO plan available to active employees.<br/>However, for 2006-07 and beyond, the District may, at its sole and exclusive discretion, permit eligible retirees to<br/>select either plan without additional cost except as modified by the percent of premium schedule below, (see current<br/>contract language)</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;districts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose of determining the amount of</p>
<p>premium to be paid by the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bv&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District</p>

<p>Employees on District-approved unpaid leaves of absence may elect to continue coverage for themselves (and<br/>dependents) by mailing the entire premium payment required for coverage, made payable to the District, and<br/>submitted to the Personnel Office. An employee on the District Leave of Absence plan whose payment is not<br/>received by the 15th of each month will be notified in writing as to lack of payment and will be provided a<br/>thirty (30) day grace period to submit such payment. If payment is not received within the grace period,<br/>insurance coverage will be cancelled. The District will develop a policy for the implementation of the required<br/>provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence Due to Illness</p>
<p>Employees who are absent due to illness and who have exhausted accumulated District-paid leaves shall<br/>continue to receive full insurance coverage paid by the District for that period of illness not to exceed three (3)<br/>months following exhaustion of said leave.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXII</p>
<p>PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW (PARI</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble</p>
<p>This Article is intended to implement the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Statutes of 1 999 with respect to the Peer Assistance<br/>and Review program (PAR), as it may be amended, and any applicable regulations. The Escondido Elementary Educators<br/>Association and the Escondido Union School District strive to provide the highest possible quality of education to the students<br/>assigned to the district. Both parties agree that optimum student performance can be achieved only if there is a fully qualified<br/>teacher in every classroom. In order for students to succeed in learning, teachers must succeed in teaching. The parties believe<br/>that all teachers, even the most skilled, must focus on continuous improvement in their professional practice. The parties agree<br/>to cooperate in the design and implementation of a professional development program to improve the quality of instruction<br/>through expanded and improved staff development, peer assistance, and professional accountability. The parties agree the<br/>focus of the Peer Assistance and Review Program shall be to provide assistance, not to evaluate Bargaining Unit Members.<br/>Teachers recommended to the program are viewed as valuable professionals who are entitled to have resources available to<br/>them to enhance continuous performance improvement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as negotiations are concluded on a PAR process, the District shall provide the required certification that PAR will be<br/>implemented July 1, 2000,</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Assistance and Review Panel</p>
<p>1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel will consist of five (5) members. Members of the PAR Panel will include three (3) members selected by<br/>the Association, and two administrative representatives selected by the District, The PAR Panel will establish the<br/>operational procedures of the Panel.</p>
<p>2, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Panel will establish its meeting schedule to include Panel Meetings, classroom observations, workshops,<br/>trainings and any other related activities deemed appropriate. To hold meetings, four of the five members of the<br/>PAR Panel must be present. Such meetings may take place during the regular workday, in which event teachers who<br/>are members of the Panel will be released, from their regular duties without loss of pay. PAR Panel members shall<br/>receive a $3,000 yearly stipend for services on the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAR Panel shall be responsible for selecting Consulting Teachers (defined in Section E). Written confirmation of</p>
<p>participation in the PAR program will be provided by the PAR Panel to Participating Teachers, referred teachers,<br/>Principals or immediate supervisors, and Consulting Teachers.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAR Panel, either by consensus or majority vote, will adopt Guidelines for implementing the provisions of this</p>
