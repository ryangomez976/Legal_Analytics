<p>7.3.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations Upon Arbitrator</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change, add to, or<br/>subtract from any of the terms of this Agreement, but shall determine<br/>only whether or not there has been a violation of this Agreement in<br/>the respect alleged in the grievance and the appropriate remedy. The<br/>decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely upon the evidence and<br/>arguments presented by the respective parties in the presence of each<br/>other, and upon arguments presented in briefs. This Agreement<br/>constitutes a collective bargaining agreement between the parties<br/>which shall be interpreted and applied by the parties and by the<br/>arbitrator in the same manner as any other collective bargaining<br/>agreement for the laws in the State of California. The function and<br/>purpose of the arbitrator is to determine disputed interpretations of<br/>terms actually found in the Agreement, or to determine disputed facts<br/>upon which the application of the Agreement depends. The arbitrator<br/>shall therefore not have authority to decide any issue not submitted or<br/>to interpret or apply the Agreement so as to change what can fairly be<br/>said to have been the intent of the parties as determined by generally<br/>accepted rules for contract construction. Past practice of the parties in<br/>interpreting or applying terms of this Agreement may be relevant<br/>evidence, but shall not be used so as to justify, or result in, a<br/>modification (whether by addition or detraction) of the written terms<br/>of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall only have the power to render an award applying<br/>the language of the Agreement in force at the time of the alleged<br/>misinterpretation, misapplication, or violation.</p>
<p>The arbitrator may hear and determine only one (1) grievance at a<br/>time unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. Both parties will in<br/>good faith endeavor to handle cases which involve the same or<br/>similar facts and issues in an expedient and convenient manner.</p>
<p>No decision rendered by the arbitrator shall be retroactive beyond the<br/>beginning of the last payroll period prior to the twenty (20) day<br/>period specified in Step 1 of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>7-5</p>
<p>7.3 .4 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules of Procedure</p>

<p>The decision of the arbitrator, within the limits herein prescribed,<br/>shall be binding on the Association, the District and the grievant.</p>
<p>7.4 No Reprisals</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken against any participant in the grievance procedure<br/>by reason of such participation.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 9: TRANSFER PROCEDURES</p>
<p>9.1 Definitions</p>
<p>9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer</p>
<p>A transfer is defined as the relocation of unit members between schools or<br/>between a school and a district office department. Transfers fall into two (2)<br/>categories: (1) voluntary transfers that are initiated at the request of the unit<br/>members, and (2) involuntary or administrative transfers that are initiated by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority</p>
<p>For the purposes of the transfer Article, the term &quot;seniority&quot; shall mean the unit<br/>member's total continuous service to the District in a certificated position,<br/>beginning with the first (1st) day of paid service as a probationary employee.<br/>The Board shall maintain an up-to-date seniority list, which for purposes of this<br/>Article shall be the &quot;order of employment list&quot; required by Education Code<br/>Section 44845. This list shall be sent to the Association by November 1 of each<br/>school year and shall be posted at each site.</p>
<p>Every probationary or permanent employee employed after June 30, 1947 shall<br/>be deemed to have been employed on the date upon which s/he first rendered<br/>paid service in a probationary position.</p>
<p>9.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>
<p>For purposes of this section, a reassignment occurs when a unit member is<br/>required to teach in a department in which s/he was not teaching the previous<br/>year.</p>
<p>9.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening</p>
<p>An opening is defined as a position at a school or administrative department<br/>location which the District has determined is to be filled by a regular<br/>probationary or permanent unit member rather than a substitute or a temporary.</p>
<p>9.2 Posting of Openings</p>
<p>9.2.1 The District shall post at each school location a notice of each opening as it<br/>occurs during the regular school year or summer session. Each notice shall<br/>state a deadline for applications which shall be not less than seven (7) days after<br/>posting. In the event an opening becomes available once the teacher work year<br/>begins, the deadline for application shall not be less than three (3) days. The<br/>opening shall not be filled prior to such deadline. Postings shall be sent to the<br/>Association Office.</p>
<p>9-1</p>
<p>9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opening, for posting purposes, is not created when a permanent or<br/>probationary unit member is on a paid or unpaid leave of absence, a one (1)<br/>semester opening exists, or when a surplus unit member is available with an<br/>appropriate teaching major or minor.</p>
<p>9.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posting errors shall not be subject to grievance. The error shall be corrected<br/>prior to filling the opening.</p>
<p>9.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who requests transfer to an available position and is denied may<br/>be provided a written statement, if so requested by the unit member.</p>
<p>9.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a request for transfer is without prejudice. It does not jeopardize a<br/>unit member's present assignment. The request may be withdrawn any time<br/>prior to confirmation that the transfer has been approved.</p>
<p>9.3 Voluntary Transfer</p>
<p>Any unit member may apply for a voluntary transfer by submitting a “Request for<br/>Transfer” form to Human Resources prior to the closing date of the vacancy for which<br/>they are applying. The Human Resources office will notify the principal of the school<br/>where the vacancy exists and such unit member shall be offered an opportunity to<br/>interview. The Human Resources office will also notify the principal of the teacher’s<br/>current school.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual Exchange of Positions</p>
<p>A unit member may initiate an exchange of assignment for one (1) school year, providing<br/>there is agreement with the involved principal and exchange unit members. If, at the<br/>conclusion of the school year, all parties agree, the exchange of assignment shall become<br/>permanent.</p>
<p>9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer-Surplus</p>
<p>9.5.1 The parties recognize that it may be necessary to transfer unit members<br/>involuntarily because of enrollment adjustments, budgetary restrictions or<br/>curricular needs.</p>
<p>For purposes of this section only, a bargaining unit member whose assignment<br/>includes more than one department shall be determined to be a member of the<br/>department which is the majority of his/her assignment. When departments in a<br/>bargaining unit member’s assignment are equally distributed, the unit member<br/>shall determine in which department s/he is a member and give written<br/>notification within five (5) days of the beginning of the school year or the<br/>effective date of the schedule change. If a permanent change in a unit member’s<br/>schedule occurs at any point in the school year, this language will apply to<br/>determine the new department designation.</p>
<p>9-2</p>
<p>When a school principal is notified by the District of the school's allocation of<br/>teaching staff, the administrator, at an all-faculty meeting, shall notify the<br/>faculty of the possibility of surplus and ask for volunteers for transfer.<br/>Consideration will be given to these volunteers if it contributes to the resolution<br/>of the surplus issue as determined by the site administrator.</p>
<p>In determining the department from which unit members are to be surplused,<br/>the principal will provide the department with a rationale for his/her decision.<br/>The rationale will be provided in writing upon request. The principal’s decision<br/>may be appealed to the Superintendent or his/her designee. No department shall<br/>be selected for surplus, nor any unit member transferred arbitrarily or<br/>capriciously. For purposes of this section, English, ELD, and Reading shall be<br/>considered one (1) department.</p>
<p>9.5.2 Surplus Criteria Point System</p>
<p>In order to make the process consistent, the Association and the District agree to<br/>a scoring system to be utilized whenever a surplus situation exists. Please note<br/>that the scoring system is designed to consistently determine who will be<br/>transferred and is not designed to prevent involuntary transfers.</p>
<p>There are four (4) criteria that shall be used in determining who is to be<br/>surplused. Listed below are the criteria and points to be awarded.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials: Each teacher properly credentialed to teach the subject to be<br/>surplused shall be given one (1) point. Please note that CLAD is a certificate<br/>and not a credential.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra-Service Pay (ESP): Any teacher who is serving, during the current<br/>school year, in a full or partial extra-service pay position will receive one (1)<br/>point (maximum). The department chair is not given a point for extra-service<br/>pay. Only one (1) extra-service pay point is given regardless of the number<br/>of extra-service pay positions the unit member holds. The point will be<br/>determined after the Spring/4th quarter sports season begins unless the unit<br/>member has already completed an assignment. The assignment must be<br/>fulfilled by the unit member in order to maintain the point. If the assignment<br/>is not fulfilled, the point will be rescinded and the surplus process will be<br/>adjusted.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department Leadership: The teacher(s) serving, during the current school<br/>year, as full or shared department chair shall receive one (1) point.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority: One (1) point shall be granted to each teacher in the department<br/>determined to be in a surplus situation except for those teachers<br/>corresponding to the number of transferees who have the least district<br/>seniority. For example, if the department has seven (7) members and will be<br/>reduced to five (5), the five (5) most senior members get a point.</p>
<p>Each teacher’s points from that department are totaled and, in the absence of<br/>volunteers, the teacher(s) with the lowest points will be surplused.</p>
<p>9-3</p>
<p>9.5.3 Tie Breaker for Surplus</p>
<p>If a tie exists after all of the steps above have been taken, the teacher with the<br/>least district seniority shall be surplused. In the event that a tie still exists, the<br/>following criteria will be applied in the priority indicated to determine the<br/>employee that is involuntarily transferred:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with three or more years temporary status prior to probationary year</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with two years temporary status prior to probationary year</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with one year temporary status prior to probationary year</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with clear single-subject credential / Level 2 Special Education<br/>Credential</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with preliminary single-subject credential / Level 1 Special<br/>Education Credential</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with multiple subjects clear credential AND single subject<br/>authorization</p>
<p>g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with multiple subjects preliminary credential AND single subject<br/>authorization</p>
<p>h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with single subject internship credential</p>
<p>i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with clear multiple subjects credential</p>
<p>j) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with preliminary multiple subjects credential</p>
<p>k) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with certification authorizing instruction to EL students</p>
<p>l) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with specialized training who are highly qualified in math, science,<br/>or special education according to NCLB requirements</p>
<p>m) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons who are currently assigned to one of the following specialized<br/>assignments listed as follows, not listed in priority order:</p>
<p>Activities Director (JH or SH)</p>
<p>Athletic/Intramural Sports Director<br/>Department Chair</p>
<p>n) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with two or more single subject credentials</p>
<p>o) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons serving in three or more areas with extra service pay</p>
<p>p) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons serving in two areas with extra service pay</p>
<p>q) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience as defined by initial salary placement schedule</p>
<p>r) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons who are National Board Certified Teachers (NBCT)</p>
<p>s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with a Doctoral Degree</p>
<p>t) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with a Master’s Degree</p>
<p>u) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with additional service to the district in a certificated non-teaching<br/>position</p>
<p>v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons with additional service to the district in a non-certificated, paid<br/>position</p>
<p>It is agreed that in the event the District is still unable to select employees to be<br/>terminated using the above criteria, then a lottery shall be used to determine<br/>employment rights as between employees with the same initial service who are<br/>equally competent.</p>
<p>9-4</p>
<p>9.5.4 Exemptions for Surplus</p>
<p>The Principal may exempt a limited number of key unit members from<br/>involuntary transfer. It is understood that in order to apply the exemption, the<br/>Principal will demonstrate that such exempted unit members hold a “key<br/>assignment” within the school. The Principal has discretion to exempt a<br/>maximum of two unit members within a school site considering certain factors<br/>listed below.</p>
<p>The Principal may consider the following into the decision to exempt a unit<br/>member:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordinator/Director/Advisor of a unique, special event or activity that occurs<br/>at the school site.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordinator/Director/High School Head Coach of a high profile or unique<br/>program.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who is qualified and interested to teach an existing high-level or<br/>specialized course that no other teacher at the site is qualified and interested to<br/>teach.</p>
<p>The Principal may not consider the following into the decision to exempt a unit<br/>member:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of a particular instructional methodology.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee participation or chairmanship.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnership with another teacher (i.e. inclusion, team teaching, job-sharing,<br/>etc.)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized training that does not lead to one of the considerations listed<br/>above.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments that can be filled with other qualified and interested personnel at<br/>the site.</p>
<p>The intent of this section is to allow the principal to sustain courses, programs,<br/>events and activities at the school site and to avoid its elimination due to the loss<br/>of key personnel.</p>
<p>9.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transferees whose credentials and preparation do not fit existing openings will<br/>be assigned to a contract teacher substitute pool until vacancies commensurate<br/>with their qualifications occur.</p>
<p>9.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opportunity must be provided for the unit member to meet with the<br/>administrator recommending the transfer prior to effecting the proposed transfer<br/>and be advised of the reasons for recommending such transfer. In the event that<br/>an administrator cannot meet with the transferee due to vacation periods, illness,<br/>leaves of absence or other similar reasons, the administrator shall effect this<br/>section by placing a certified letter in the United States mail addressed to the<br/>transferee at his/her last known address.</p>
<p>9-5</p>
<p>9.6 Involuntary Transfer for Special Education &amp; Itinerant Unit Members</p>
<p>The District and ASTA acknowledge that unit members providing mandated services to<br/>students receiving special education must have credentials, training and experiences that<br/>are unique and essential in meeting the needs of students. Specialized services provided<br/>by itinerant assignments are limited to APE, Speech/Language Pathologists, Visually<br/>Impaired and Orthopedic Services or, in exceptional circumstances, RSP teachers at more<br/>than two (2) sites. An Itinerant teacher offers services in one of the above categories at<br/>more than one site. All Itinerant teachers will be assigned to the SYS for purpose of being<br/>departmentalized for Section 9.5 (Involuntary Transfer). If a change to a unit member’s<br/>assignment will result in a change of work location (adding, eliminating or switching one<br/>or more school site) prior to or during the school year, the following process will occur:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will communicate and/or meet with the unit member to discuss the reason<br/>for the change of work location(s), before the change is implemented.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member agrees to the change in work location(s), the change is<br/>implemented.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member does not agree to the change of work location(s), other options will<br/>be explored and considered, including seeking volunteers.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If none of the options are acceptable to the District or the employee(s) involved, the<br/>surplus process in Article 9.5.2 will be utilized and will be applied to the employee<br/>and any other staff members who may be affected.</p>
<p>9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment Within a School</p>
<p>Reassignments within a school are the responsibility of the principal. The principal shall<br/>take into consideration the staffing needs, the curriculum of the school and the credential<br/>authorization of the unit members. Prior to making a reassignment, the principal shall<br/>discuss the reassignment with the unit member. In the event that an administrator cannot<br/>meet with the reassigned unit member due to vacation periods, illness, leaves of absence<br/>or other similar reasons, the administrator shall effect this section by placing a certified<br/>letter in the United States mail addressed to the unit member at his/her last known<br/>address.</p>
<p>No unit member shall be reassigned arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>
<p>Unit members whose assignments will remain the same the following year may, at their<br/>discretion, consult with the principal concerning this continuing assignment.</p>
<p>9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendent's Transfer</p>
<p>In situations not provided for herein, such power to assign includes the power to transfer<br/>professional personnel within the District when the Superintendent concludes that such a<br/>transfer is in the best interest of the District.</p>

<p>9.9</p>
<p>Transfer - School Closures</p>
<p>Involuntary transfers made during years that schools are closed shall be made as follows:</p>

<p>Involuntary transferees shall have the right to return, in the event of a vacancy, to the<br/>school from which s/he was transferred within one and one quarter (1-1/4) years. This<br/>right includes vacancies which are less than full-time. Unit members who wish to return<br/>will be required to initiate a request to return when the vacancy is posted.</p>
<p>9.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Day</p>
<p>Whenever a unit member is to be transferred during any period of time other than the first<br/>(1st) day of the work year, said unit member shall be given a minimum of one (1) day<br/>without pupils in order to adequately relocate and prepare. In cases where unit members<br/>are moving from one site to another, upon request, the District shall assist them in<br/>moving materials.</p>

A unit member shall retain the<br/>right to consult with the administrator regarding his/her assignment.</p>
<p>10.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) working days prior to the close of the school year the principal or<br/>designee shall notify all staff members of their tentative assignments by class<br/>periods for the ensuing school year. Changes made subsequent to this<br/>notification may be made after the principal/designee has directly consulted by<br/>phone or given the unit member five (5) days’ notice by certified mail to the last<br/>known address of the unit member, of the unit member's opportunity to consult<br/>regarding the proposed changes. If inclusion becomes part of an assignment or<br/>is removed as part of an assignment, it shall be considered a change and shall<br/>require such notice. Failure to respond to the mailed notice shall be deemed a<br/>waiver, by the unit member, of such consultation rights.</p>
<p>10.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitute Coverage</p>
<p>Except in an emergency, when substitutes are available they will be hired to replace any<br/>teacher when it is known in advance that s/he will be absent from his/her assignment for<br/>more than two (2) periods.</p>
<p>10.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Course Preparation</p>
<p>Both parties recognize that the additional workload created by three or more course<br/>preparations may reduce the effectiveness of a teacher. It is therefore agreed that the<br/>administration will make a reasonable attempt to limit the number of course preparations<br/>assigned to each teacher to two (2) course preparations per semester. The administration<br/>will consider all reasonable alternatives to ensure that the number of course preparations<br/>is equitable throughout each department and throughout the school.</p>
<p>10-3</p>
<p>10.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A course preparation is defined as any situation in which the teacher must<br/>specifically prepare lessons, tests, or other activities for any class or block<br/>having a different course title, course number, or having different identified<br/>ability levels within a course title. “Different identified ability levels” does not<br/>refer to the normal diversity of academic abilities found in a regular classroom<br/>but rather to an individual or group that is designated by the school as requiring<br/>special accommodations. RSP teachers who are assigned to inclusion classes<br/>for the purpose of planning for and participating in instruction with more than<br/>one regular education teacher shall be recognized as having one course<br/>preparation for each teacher to which they are assigned.</p>
<p>10.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that a teacher may need to be assigned more than two (2) course<br/>preparations, the school administration will consider all reasonable alternatives<br/>to alleviate the additional responsibility being placed on the teacher and make a<br/>reasonable attempt to remedy any departmental inequities that may be created<br/>by the assignment of an additional course preparation.</p>
<p>10.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it has been determined that, in the best interest of the school, it is necessary to<br/>assign a teacher more than two course preparations, the teacher may request a<br/>meeting with the administrator no later than two (2) workdays from receipt of<br/>verifiable notice of the assignment. At this meeting the administrator will<br/>consider the teacher’s input and provide written rationale for the assignment.</p>
<p>10.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may request a meeting with the administration during the<br/>summer if they are notified after the end of the school year that their teaching<br/>schedule will contain more than two course preparations. It is understood that<br/>requesting a meeting during the summer is optional for the unit member. If the<br/>unit member chooses not to schedule a meeting, the timeline for the request<br/>begins the first workday of the new school year.</p>
<p>10.10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the teacher is not satisfied that all options have been fully explored at the<br/>school site, the teacher may file an appeal with the Superintendent’s designee no<br/>later than two (2) workdays from the receipt of the written rationale or two (2)<br/>workdays from the first day of the work year for changes that may have<br/>occurred over the summer. The Superintendent’s designee will respond to the<br/>appeal within five (5) workdays.</p>
<p>10.11 Instructional Day</p>
<p>If the number of instructional minutes for a particular school allows, and upon request of<br/>a principal and a majority of the faculty, the District shall grant an additional minimum<br/>day at the end of each semester for testing, grading, and other record keeping purposes.</p>
<p>10.12 Professional Attire</p>
<p>Certificated staff is requested to be professionally dressed while on duty. Therefore, the<br/>Association and the District agree to the following guidelines:</p>
<p>10-4</p>
<p>10.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated bargaining unit members may be advised by an administrator or<br/>supervisor not to wear T-shirts or shorts while on duty.</p>
<p>10.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorized school T-shirts may be worn while on duty when designated by the<br/>administrator or supervisor.</p>
<p>10.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Education teachers or unit members assigned to teach in classrooms<br/>without air conditioning may be permitted to wear shorts while on duty.</p>
<p>The Association and District further agree to jointly monitor the implementation of these<br/>guidelines and investigate future modifications of the guidelines.</p>
<p>10.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum Dav</p>
<p>The District shall schedule one (1) student minimum day to be held on the same day that<br/>either an Open House or Back-to-School Night event is held at each site designated as a<br/>junior high. The minimum day shall be determined by the site administrator with input<br/>from the site unit members.</p>
<p>10.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traveling Teachers</p>
<p>Unit members required to travel to different classrooms during the school day will be<br/>provided an adequate workspace during the conference/prep period.</p>
<p>10.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss of Classroom</p>
<p>An attempt shall be made to accommodate room assignments so that a unit member does<br/>not lose the use of their assigned classroom during their conference period for more than<br/>two (2) consecutive school years.</p>
<p>10-5</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11: CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>The principal or designee may consult with members of the staff during the process of assigning<br/>pupils to classes. The Board of Trustees will annually review the staffing procedures used within<br/>the District.</p>
<p>11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain Patterns</p>
<p>The Board will continue its effort to maintain staffing patterns that will avoid state<br/>penalties.</p>
<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade Levels and Instructional Areas</p>
<p>It is recognized that class sizes at various grade levels and in different instructional areas<br/>cannot be identical.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Flexibility</p>
<p>The Board recognizes the advantages of instructional groupings different from the<br/>historically standard classrooms; e.g., large group instruction, cooperative teaching<br/>teams, multi-age groupings, or low enrollment classes for specially funded projects and<br/>the Board shall be allowed the flexibility to utilize such groupings.</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Interests</p>
<p>The Board shall promote class size which is within the best interests of the students<br/>concerned.</p>
<p>11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduling</p>
<p>The Board agrees that it shall not arbitrarily or capriciously schedule abnormally or<br/>unreasonably large classes within the District. Every attempt shall be made to adjust<br/>class sizes to assure that unit members share the teaching load.</p>
<p>11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printout. Complaints and Monitoring</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third week of each semester, each teacher will receive a printout<br/>of class sizes in his/her department. The teacher may request a consultation with the<br/>principal to discuss alternatives to alleviate large class sizes.</p>
<p>If a unit member has a class size complaint which has not been resolved by the principal<br/>within twenty-five (25) school days of the start of a semester, the unit member may,<br/>appeal to the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources. The Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Human Resources will review the complaint and within five (5) days of receipt of the<br/>complaint will either deny the complaint or make a recommendation to the<br/>Superintendent for resolution of the complaint.</p>
<p>11-1</p>
<p>The District will continue to monitor and require justification by the site administrator for<br/>exceedingly large classes, and will request the results of any teacher consultation(s)<br/>resulting from large class sizes.</p>
<p>11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Staffing</p>
<p>Beginning with the opening day of school, the District will authorize additional staffing<br/>to sites based upon verification of growth of enrollment by site. This additional staffing<br/>will reflect the current teacher/student ratio as established annually by the District. The<br/>site administration will post daily in the mailroom the total enrollment in the school and<br/>enrollment in each class and the total number of teachers included in the staffing ratio on<br/>each of the first 20 days of the school year. Whenever the school is authorized to hire<br/>additional teachers due to growth in enrollment, the site administration shall post such<br/>information in the mailroom.</p>
<p>11.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student/Teacher Ratio</p>
<p>Teacher unit members who do not teach a full regular instructional day shall be<br/>proportionally counted in the student/teacher ratio for that site.</p>
<p>11.9 Student Load</p>
<p>By the 2015-16 school year, the following student load maximums will be established:</p>
<p>The maximum student load for bargaining unit members teaching in the traditional<br/>comprehensive junior high schools and Oxford Academy, exclusive of Physical<br/>Education, athletics, and performing arts, shall be 222 students.</p>
<p>The maximum student load for bargaining unit members teaching in the traditional<br/>comprehensive senior high schools and eLearning, exclusive of Physical Education,<br/>athletics, and performing arts, shall be 195 students.</p>
<p>11.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Education</p>
<p>The maximum student load for bargaining unit members teaching junior high<br/>Physical Education shall be 336 students.</p>

<p>11.9.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All maximums in this article shall be adjusted on a pro-rata basis for bargaining<br/>unit members who teach an additional period per Article 14.8, part-time, or a<br/>split-subject assignment.</p>
<p>11.9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximums in this article may be exceeded by mutual agreement of the District<br/>and the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>11-3</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12: EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that an effective evaluation system recognizes the<br/>complexities of teaching and student learning, while focusing on continuous improvement of the<br/>evaluatee’s teaching practice. Administrators and teachers must work together to build a<br/>collaborative and trusting environment to achieve that goal. While formal evaluation occurs<br/>every two to five years, it should not be considered an isolated event without connection to<br/>continuous teacher growth and reflection.</p>
<p>Procedures</p>
<p>12.1 Evaluator</p>
<p>The principal or designated administrative representative shall conduct the evaluation.<br/>However, the unit member shall have the right to request an alternate evaluator. Such<br/>request shall be made in writing to the principal or immediate supervisor. Should the<br/>request be denied, the rationale shall also be submitted in writing to the unit member. All<br/>evaluators must have appropriate training and regular calibration in all evaluation<br/>procedures and instruments.</p>
<p>12.2 Tiered Evaluation</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize that the evaluation process varies among the<br/>different members of the bargaining unit. Therefore, a three-tiered system shall be<br/>implemented to better utilize the time and efforts of the evaluator and the unit member.<br/>Accordingly, the evaluation process shall be comprised of the three following tiers:</p>
<p>Tier One - The Tier One Teacher is a unit member who has completed less than ten (10)<br/>years certificated service serving in a position established by Article 2.1.1 in the District,<br/>or less than eight (8) years in permanent status in the District, and has had satisfactory<br/>evaluations. The frequency of evaluation shall be as follows: (1) Non-permanent unit<br/>members shall be evaluated every year; and (2) Permanent unit members shall be<br/>evaluated every other year until they achieve Tier Two Teacher status as defined below.</p>
<p>Tier Two - The Tier Two Teacher has received satisfactory evaluations for the past two<br/>evaluation periods, is a permanent teacher and has completed 10 (ten) years or more<br/>certificated service serving in a position established by Article 2.1.1 in the District, is<br/>NCLB compliant (if applicable), and holds an appropriate credential. The Tier Two<br/>evaluation is an introspective instrument that requires evaluatees to reflect on their<br/>successes and share their expertise with other unit members. Completion of Tier 2<br/>Agreement Form (Appendix E) shall be evidence of a bargaining unit member’s<br/>eligibility for Tier Two.</p>
<p>Improving Teacher - The Improving Teacher has received an unsatisfactory evaluation<br/>in the previous year based on the Tier One or Tier Two evaluation process, has been<br/>referred to Peer Assistance Review (PAR), and has developed a remediation plan with the<br/>evaluator and the PAR consulting teacher, has a remediation plan in effect, and has been</p>
<p>12-1</p>
<p>referred to PAR. An Improving Teacher shall have a minimum of three observations<br/>during the evaluation/remediation period conducted by their evaluator.</p>
<p>12.3 Goals and Objectives (California Standards of the Teaching Profession - CSTP1</p>
<p>The following (CSTP) Goals and Objectives shall be the basis of all evaluations<br/>regardless of the tier or level used in each individual evaluation.</p>
<p>12.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and Supporting Students in Learning</p>
<p>Teachers learn about their students’ interests in order to better engage them in<br/>the learning process. They connect subject matter to students’ prior knowledge,<br/>backgrounds, and life experiences, as well as meaningful, real-life situations.<br/>Teachers will use a variety of instructional strategies, resources and<br/>technologies to meet the diverse learning needs of students. In addition,<br/>teachers will promote critical-thinking skills through the use of inquiry,<br/>problem-solving, reflection, and utilize frequent formative assessments to guide<br/>their instruction.</p>
<p>12.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning.<br/>Teachers promote social development and responsibility within a caring<br/>community where students are treated fairly and respectfully. They create<br/>physical or virtual learning environments that promote student learning, reflect<br/>diversity, and encourage constructive and productive interactions among<br/>students. They establish and maintain learning environments that are<br/>physically, intellectually, and emotionally safe. Teachers create a rigorous<br/>learning environment with high expectations and appropriate support for<br/>students. Teachers develop, communicate, and maintain high standards for<br/>individual and group behavior. They employ classroom routines, procedures,<br/>norms, and supports for positive behavior to foster a climate in which students<br/>can learn. They use instructional time to optimize learning.</p>
<p>12.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning<br/>Teachers exhibit in-depth working knowledge of subject matter, academic<br/>content standards, and curriculum frameworks. They apply knowledge of<br/>student development and proficiencies to assist students in the understanding of<br/>content. They organize curriculum to facilitate students’ understanding of the<br/>subject matter. Teachers utilize instructional strategies that are appropriate to<br/>the subject matter. They use and adapt resources, technologies, and standards-<br/>aligned instructional materials, including adopted materials, to make subject<br/>matter accessible to students. They address the needs of English learners and<br/>students with special needs to provide equitable access to the content.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.4 Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for Students</p>
<p>Teachers use knowledge of students’ academic readiness, language proficiency,<br/>cultural background, and individual development to plan instruction. They<br/>establish and articulate goals for student learning. They develop and sequence<br/>long-term and short-term instructional plans to support student learning.<br/>Teachers plan instruction that incorporates appropriate strategies to meet the</p>
<p>12-2</p>
<p>diverse learning needs of students. They modify and adapt instructional plans to<br/>meet the assessed learning needs of students.</p>
<p>12.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing Students for Learning</p>
<p>Teachers apply knowledge of the purposes, characteristics, and uses of different<br/>types of assessments. They collect and analyze assessment data from a variety<br/>of sources and use those data to inform instruction. They review data, both<br/>individually and with colleagues, to monitor student learning. Teachers use<br/>assessment data to establish learning goals and to plan, differentiate, and modify<br/>instruction. They involve students in self-assessment, goal setting, and<br/>monitoring progress. Teachers use available technologies to assist in<br/>assessment, analysis, and communication of student learning. They use<br/>assessment information to share timely and comprehensible feedback with<br/>students and their families.</p>
<p>12.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing as a Professional Educator</p>
<p>Teachers reflect on their teaching practice to support student learning. They<br/>establish professional goals and engage in continuous and purposeful<br/>professional growth and development. They collaborate with colleagues and<br/>engage in the broader professional community to support teacher and student<br/>learning. Teachers learn about and work with families to support student<br/>learning. They engage local communities in support of the instructional<br/>program. They manage professional responsibilities to maintain motivation and<br/>commitment to students. Teachers demonstrate professional responsibility,<br/>integrity, and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that the evaluator may not observe all (or<br/>even a majority of) the descriptors of the six goals and objectives listed above in<br/>an observation session.</p>
<p>12.4 Frequency of Evaluation</p>
<p>All non-permanent Tier One unit members shall be evaluated every year. Permanent unit<br/>members shall be evaluated every other year until reaching Tier Two status. As provided<br/>herein, Tier Two Teachers shall be evaluated every five years if they meet the<br/>requirements of state and federal laws.</p>
<p>Should the evaluator determine that, because of observed and documented deficiencies in<br/>meeting the District’s Goals and Objectives outlined herein, a Tier One or Two Teacher<br/>requires a more formal evaluation; the evaluator shall notify the teacher at least two<br/>weeks before the end of the school year. Or, if the teacher is being evaluated, the<br/>evaluator shall give an unsatisfactory evaluation which will bring about an Improving<br/>Teacher evaluation in the subsequent year. Such deficiencies shall only be related to the<br/>Goals and Objectives found in this article.</p>
<p>In the event an evaluatee believes the above administrative decision is unsubstantiated,<br/>the unit member shall attempt to resolve the matter directly with the evaluator and/or<br/>principal. If a resolution is unable to be reached, the evaluatee may appeal the final</p>
<p>12-3</p>
<p>evaluation, by providing specific information and data to the Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Human Resources. The decision of the Assistant Superintendent is final and no part of<br/>the evaluation content is grievable under Article 7 of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Evaluation Conference</p>
<p>The evaluator shall conduct a Preliminary Evaluation Conference with each evaluatee<br/>prior to the commencement of the formal evaluation. The purpose of the Preliminary<br/>Evaluation Conference is to allow both the evaluator and unit member to review the<br/>evaluation process, including the Goals and Objectives, and discuss examples of expected<br/>performance. The goal of this process is to reach an understanding regarding the<br/>expectations for the observation. Evaluation Worksheet for both the Formal Observation<br/>and the Project-Reflective Essay options (Appendix E) will be given to Evaluatees at the<br/>time of the Preliminary Evaluation Conference.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduling of the Observation and Pre-Observation Conference</p>
<p>The evaluator and the evaluatee will schedule the pre-observation conference and the<br/>[first] observation date and time at least 10 days prior to the observation. By mutual<br/>agreement, the scheduling may be done less than 10 days prior to the observation.</p>
<p>Additional observations will be scheduled at least 5 days in advance or less by mutual<br/>agreement. A pre-observation conference is not required for additional observations<br/>during the school year.</p>
<p>12.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Observation Conference</p>
<p>A pre-observation conference shall be held between the evaluator and the evaluatee no<br/>less than five days (or less than five days by mutual agreement) before the first scheduled<br/>observation. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss and review the evaluation process<br/>for the initial scheduled observation period. The reflection/discussion questions<br/>(described infra) for the post-observation conference will be distributed to the evaluatee<br/>at this time. A discussion for clarification of the reflection questions may take place.</p>
<p>12.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations and Post Observation Conference</p>
<p>The unit member to be evaluated shall be observed for one period per observation in<br/>accordance with the evaluation calendar. Within ten (10) school days of the observation,<br/>the Observation Form shall be completed and a follow-up conference with the evaluatee<br/>shall be conducted to discuss the report. All comments on the report must be factual and<br/>objective. The time limits may be extended by mutual agreement of the evaluator and<br/>evaluatee.</p>
<p>12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project and Reflective Essay</p>
<p>A Tier Two teacher may select to be evaluated using the Project and Reflective Essay<br/>option in lieu of using the formal observation process. The project shall be mutually<br/>agreed upon by evaluatee and evaluator and shall be aligned with the (CSTP) Goals and</p>
<p>12-4</p>
<p>Objectives. Examples of such projects may include, but are not limited to, one of the<br/>following: (1) leading or participating in a professional development activity; (2)<br/>mentor/collaborate with another teacher; (3) an educational research paper/book report on<br/>an educational topic; (4) a study or project using data from the evaluatee’s class(es); (5) a<br/>project within a staff leadership position that has relevance to the educational goals of the<br/>school; or (6) a case study focusing on the evaluatee’s students.</p>
<p>The evaluatee will also submit a reflective, self-assessment essay that includes an<br/>explanation of how the project could be applied in the classroom. This essay should also<br/>contain a reflection on strengths and areas of growth as related to the teacher’s own<br/>practice and shall be aligned to the (CSTP) Goals and Objectives.</p>
<p>12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Forms</p>
<p>All evaluation/observation forms are appended to this agreement. The administration at<br/>individual school sites shall not create any additional forms or handouts or require other<br/>supplementary materials to be completed by the evaluatee. The evaluatee has the right to<br/>attach a rebuttal reflecting their objection(s) to any aspect of any observation report or<br/>final evaluation.

<p>15.2 Insurance Committee</p>
<p>The parties agree that the overriding purpose of the Insurance Committee (“Committee”)<br/>is to fulfill the commitment contained herein and in previous memoranda of<br/>understanding regarding cost containment of health and welfare premiums.

<p>16.1 Part-Time Employment</p>

This reduced workload<br/>shall be authorized upon request of any full-time unit member subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>16.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must have reached the age of fifty-five (55) years prior to<br/>reduction in workload.</p>
<p>16.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member must have at least ten (10) years of full-time employment in<br/>this District in a position requiring certification, of which the immediately<br/>preceding five (5) years were full-time employment, and currently earning a<br/>salary equivalent to Column II, Step 7, or more.</p>
<p>16.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum part-time employment shall be one-half (1/2) of the number of<br/>days of service required by the unit member's contract of employment during<br/>the final year of service in a full-time position. The term &quot;one-half means full¬<br/>time for one-half (1/2) the days required for the individual's position<br/>classification.</p>
<p>16.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only unit members who do not hold positions with salaries above that of the<br/>school principals are eligible for this reduced workload-retirement benefits<br/>program.</p>
<p>16.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment and full retirement benefits must be<br/>exercised on an annual basis.</p>
<p>16.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for part-time employment must be exercised at the request of the<br/>unit member and formalized by a written agreement prior to the period of<br/>reduced service. The Director, Human Resources, shall specify the conditions of<br/>reduced service and shall establish the deadlines for making application and<br/>reaching agreement. The agreement can be revoked only with the mutual<br/>consent of the unit member and the District.</p>
<p>16.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member who elects a reduced workload in accordance with the<br/>conditions of this policy shall be paid a salary which is the pro rata share of the<br/>salary that would be earned if the request for part-time employment had not<br/>been made, and shall retain all other rights and benefits of full employment,<br/>provided the unit member elects to contribute to the Teachers' Retirement Fund<br/>the amount that would have been contributed if employment was on a full-time<br/>basis. If the unit member elects to contribute the full-time employment share to<br/>the Teachers' Retirement Fund, the District shall also do the same to assure full¬<br/>time employment retirement allowance.</p>
<p>16-1</p>
<p>16.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to deny granting a reduced workload to any unit<br/>member if doing so would create a staffing problem.</p>
<p>16.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be entitled to receive retirement credit for more than ten<br/>(10) years of service under this policy.</p>
<p>16.2 Job Sharing</p>

The minimum job sharing employment shall be one-<br/>half (1/2) of the number of days of service required by the unit member's<br/>contract of employment. The term &quot;one-half<sup>1</sup> (1/2) means full-time for one-half<br/>(1/2) of days required for the individual's position classification. The unit<br/>member receives fringe benefits under Article 15 during the term of his/her<br/>employment. The District reserves the right to deny the granting of job sharing<br/>if doing so would create a legal/staffing problem, as determined by the District.</p>
<p>16.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing shall refer to two (2) unit members on regular contracts sharing one<br/>(1) teaching assignment. Two (2) unit members may share an assignment for a<br/>minimum of one (1) year.

An<br/>application for job-sharing must include a proposal specifying how the<br/>employee will fulfill the responsibilities and duties of the position. The total<br/>number of positions shared by unit members participating in a job share shall<br/>not exceed 1% of the bargaining unit. The District shall approve or deny<br/>requests and notify, in writing, the applicants of its decision by May 1.<br/>Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement, job sharing unit members'<br/>wages, benefits, and paid leaves shall be prorated relative to the actual time<br/>worked. In no event shall the total amount of the health and welfare benefits for<br/>the job sharers exceed the amount the District would have paid if the position<br/>had not been shared.</p>
<p>16.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of the two (2) unit members and approval of the<br/>principal, a job sharing assignment may be renewed provided the two<br/>(2) unit members notify the District prior to March 1.</p>
<p>16.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member on a regular contract is in a job sharing assignment<br/>and elects to return after the first year to full-time teaching, the unit<br/>member will be returned to her/his original school if a position for<br/>which the unit member is certificated is available.</p>
<p>16.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member on a regular contract is in a job sharing assignment<br/>for more than one (1) year and elects to return to full-time teaching,<br/>the unit member will be assigned to the first available full-time<br/>teaching position for which the unit member is certificated.</p>
<p>16-2</p>
<p>16.2.2.4 In order to advance on the salary schedule, the bargaining unit<br/>members in the job share must work a minimum of 75% of the 185<br/>work days, which is a total of 139 or more days within two<br/>consecutive school years.

<p>17.2.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W ritten Reprimand</p>
<p>17.2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the administration of this procedure, the parties agree that some<br/>actions of unit members may be so severe as to not require stringent<br/>adherence to the steps outlined. It is further agreed, however, that no</p>
<p>17-2</p>

They create physical or virtual learning environments that promote student learning, reflect diversity, and<br/>encourage constructive and productive interactions among students. They establish and maintain learning environments<br/>that are physically, intellectually, and emotionally safe. Teachers create a rigorous learning environment with high<br/>expectations and appropriate support for students. Teachers develop, communicate, and maintain high standards for<br/>individual and group behavior. They employ classroom routines, procedures, norms, and supports for positive behavior to<br/>foster a climate in which students can learn. In addition, teachers use instructional time to optimize learning.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning</p>
<p>Teachers exhibit an in-depth working knowledge of their subject matter, academic content standards, and curriculum<br/>frameworks. They apply knowledge of student development and proficiencies to assist students in the understanding of<br/>content. They organize curriculum to facilitate students’ understanding of the subject matter. Teachers utilize<br/>instructional strategies that are appropriate to the subject matter. They use and adapt resources, technologies, and<br/>standards-aligned instructional materials, including adopted materials, to make subject matter accessible to students. They<br/>address the needs of English learners and students with special needs to provide universal access to the content.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for Students</p>
<p>Teachers use knowledge of students’ academic readiness, language proficiency, cultural background, and individual<br/>development to plan instruction. They establish and articulate goals for student learning. They develop and sequence<br/>long-term and short-term instructional plans to support student learning. Teachers plan instruction that incorporates<br/>appropriate strategies to meet the diverse learning needs of students. They modify and adapt instructional plans to meet<br/>the assessed learning needs of students.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing Students for Learning</p>
<p>Teachers apply knowledge of the purpose, characteristics, and use of different forms of assessment. They collect and<br/>analyze assessment data from a variety of sources and use that data to inform instruction. They review data, both<br/>individually and with colleagues to monitor student learning. Teachers use assessment data to establish learning goals and<br/>to plan, differentiate, and modify instruction. They involve students in self-assessment, goal setting, and monitoring their<br/>learning progress. Teachers use available technologies to assist in assessment, analysis, and communication of student<br/>learning. They use assessment information to share timely and comprehensible feedback with students and their families.</p>

<p>Teachers reflect on their teaching practice to support student learning. They establish professional goals and engage in<br/>continuous and purposeful professional growth and development. They collaborate with colleagues and engage in the<br/>broader professional community to support teacher and student learning. Teachers learn about and work with families to<br/>support student learning. They engage local communities in support of the instructional program. They manage<br/>professional responsibilities to maintain motivation and commitment to students. Teachers demonstrate professional<br/>responsibility, integrity, and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that the evaluator may not observe all (or even a majority of) the descriptors of the<br/>six goals and objectives listed above in an observation session.</p>

<p>EXTRA SERVICE PAY JOB DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree to form a joint work group to create<br/>and update Extra Service Pay job descriptions. This work group shall be<br/>formed before January 1, 2012 and report its findings prior to May 1, 2012.<br/>The recommendations of this work group shall become the starting point for<br/>negotiations on the issue during the next round of collective bargaining.</p>

<p>WORKDAY START TIME</p>
<p>The Anaheim Secondary Teachers Association (Association) and the Anaheim Union High<br/>School District (District) agree that when a site modifies the students' normal instructional<br/>day to an earlier start time with the purpose of using the accrued minutes to provide for<br/>staff development time, that bargaining unit members' work day start time will remain at<br/>the time that existed prior to the change in the students' start day.</p>
<p>For example, if the old bell schedule had the students starting at 8:00am, the teachers'<br/>workday began at 7:30am. If the new bell schedule has the students starting at 7:50am,<br/>then the teachers' workday still begins at 7:30am.</p>

<p>INDEPENDENT LEARNING CENTER</p>
<p>The Anaheim Secondary Teachers Association (Association) and the Anaheim Union High<br/>School District (District) agree that the Independent Learning Center's program has unique<br/>staff needs. Therefore, the Independent Learning Center will be staffed through a process<br/>rather than a transfer.</p>
<p>The workday at the Independent Learning Center may consist of flexible hours into the early<br/>evening. Nights and weekends are excluded from the workday hours for bargaining unit<br/>members assigned to the independent Learning Center. The overall workday hours in a<br/>typical week will approximate those commonly found at the other sites.</p>
<p>If bargaining unit members are assigned to work in the summer, they will receive their per<br/>diem pay and benefits for the additional work year hours.</p>
<p>If a bargaining unit member at the Independent Learning Center is working without a<br/>conference period, section 14.8 of the contract applies.</p>
<p>Section 10.6 regarding the lunch period applies to bargaining unit members at the<br/>Independent Learning Center.</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>BETWEEN</p>
<p>ANAHEIM UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT (AUHSD)</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>ANAHEIM SECONDARY TEACHERS ASSOCIATION (ASTA)</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONAL PERIODS AT TRADITIONAL AND SPECIALIZED SITES/PROGRAMS</p>
<p>The Anaheim Secondary Teachers Association (ASTA) and the Anaheim Union High School<br/>District (AUHSD) agree there are currently specialized programs and school sites that serve<br/>unique student needs such as Polaris (Independent Studies), Gilbert High School<br/>(Continuation), Hope School, Oxford Academy, Community Day School and the Independent<br/>Learning Center. It is also agreed there may be other innovative specialized programs that will<br/>serve students in the future. It is recognized that unique structures and schedules may be<br/>developed to accommodate the needs of these programs and may be different than traditional<br/>comprehensive high schools and junior high schools.</p>
<p>Therefore it is agreed and clarified that:</p>
<p>Traditional comprehensive high schools have a six (6) instructional period structure. Teachers<br/>in this setting are assigned to teach five (5) instructional periods with one (1) conference<br/>period.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional comprehensive junior high schools have a seven (7) instructional period<br/>structure. Teachers in this setting are assigned to teach six (6) instructional periods<br/>with one (1) conference period.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structures that increase or reduce the number of instructional periods at traditional<br/>comprehensive high schools and junior high schools will require an ASTA waiver or a<br/>negotiated agreement through contract language or MOU.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advisory, SSR, cluster or other non-instructional periods are not counted as<br/>instructional periods listed above.</p>
<p>It is further agreed that:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-traditional/non-comprehensive schools that meet the specialized needs of students<br/>may have a structure with more or less instructional periods compared to the<br/>traditional comprehensive structure listed above.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These non-traditional structures at non-traditional sites are not a violation of the<br/>contract and therefore do not require an ASTA waiver vote as long as other provisions<br/>of the contract are followed.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a staff member is involuntarily transferred to or currently works at a specialized site<br/>with a non-traditional structure prefers to be assigned to a comprehensive school site,<br/>he/she may request a transfer. Requests are subject to availability and must be<br/>compliant with proper credential authorization.</p>
<p>APPENDIX J-l</p>
<p>It is also agreed that:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other provisions of the ASTA/AUHSD contract apply to unit members at both the<br/>traditional comprehensive and specialized sites and programs unless otherwise<br/>specified in the contract.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 14.8 applies only to unit members who teach an additional instructional period<br/>in lieu of their assigned conference period.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it becomes necessary to waive contract language the following must occur prior to an<br/>ASTA vote is held:</p>
<p>o The Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources and ASTA President will<br/>agree in writing the exact contract language to be waived. This information will<br/>be shared with the unit members at the site and included on the voting ballot.</p>
<p>o The District representative and ASTA representative will attend an informational<br/>meeting at the school site to clarify and discuss the potential impact of the<br/>contract language waiver.</p>
<p>This MOU agreement is effective June 12, 20T3and resolves any present or past dispute.</p>

<p>The Anaheim Union High School District (AUHSD) and Anaheim Secondary Teacher's<br/>Association (ASTA) agree to the following regarding health and welfare:</p>
<p>Article 15.1.1 - Medical Insurance</p>

<p>This agreement has no effect on any other portion of the District's benefit plan.</p>
<p>If an agreement is reached with any other collective bargaining group on health and welfare<br/>that contains a greater benefit than the current plan or a higher maximum district<br/>contribution, the District or ASTA may request to re-open negotiations on health and welfare<br/>for 2014.</p>
