<p>APPENDIX</p>
<p>Job Descriptions</p>
<p>ARTICLE I</p>
<p>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>For the purposes of meeting and negotiating, the Grossmont Union High School<br/>District recognizes the Grossmont Education Association as the exclusive representative<br/>of the certificated employees of the Grossmont Union High School District as certified by<br/>the Educational Employment Relations Board, Docket No. LA-R-254 on May 23, 1977,<br/>and signed in Los Angeles, California, in compliance with the Rodda Act, SB 160, and<br/>Rules and Regulations of the Educational Employment Relations Board (Public<br/>Employment Relations Board). The unit shall include: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificated employees,</p>
<p>including Counselors, Psychologists, Speech and Language Pathologists, Program<br/>Specialists, Curriculum Specialists, Special Education Teachers, District Nurses, Summer<br/>School Teachers, ROTC Teachers, Career Technical Education Teachers, and<br/>Temporary Teachers. The unit shall exclude: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employees, including</p>
<p>substitute teachers, hourly adult school teachers, managerial employees, supervisory<br/>employees, and confidential employees.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2</p>
<p>SALARY AND COMPENSATION</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will be compensated as specified in the Certificated Salary Schedules<br/>and supporting documents. If any other employee group reaches agreement on terms for<br/>increases in salary schedules greater than below, GEA members will have the same<br/>improvement percentage applied to the salary schedule.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non classroom unit members may have duties that exceed an eight (8) hour day.<br/>Other duties, as approved by their supervisor, shall be compensated at their hourly pro<br/>rata rate.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on full-time release, including speech therapists, counselors, literacy<br/>coaches, digital high school coordinators, school-to-career coordinators, and other<br/>teachers on special assignment, will be expected to work at least a standard teaching<br/>day.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curriculum Specialists, program specialists and librarians do not have a preparation<br/>period and will receive a ten percent (10%) stipend based on their placement on the<br/>certificated salary schedule.</p>
<p>A curriculum specialist will serve a term of three consecutive years. Curriculum<br/>specialists who complete their term during a school year will be allowed to finish that year<br/>as a curriculum specialist. After a three year absence, a teacher may apply for another<br/>term as a curriculum specialist.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members with assignments exceeding 185 days are paid their per diem times<br/>the number of days worked.</p>
<p>Calculation for daily and hourly rate of pay for all GEA members will be figured as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily Rate = Annual salary divided by number of contract days worked (i.e.</p>
<p>$44,854.39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185).</p>
<p>For members working more than 185 days, annual salary is calculated by<br/>annual salary divided by 185 contract days, times number of contract days<br/>worked over 185 (i.e. $68,245.02 -r- 185 x number of contract days [191 for<br/>counselors]).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hourly Rate - Annual salary divided by number of contract days worked divided<br/>by five (5) hours (i.e. $44,954.39 -r- 185 -r- 5).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>C. Work Days for the school year are as follows:</p>
<p>Assignment:</p>
<p>Teacher<br/>JROTC Teacher<br/>Agriculture Teacher<br/>Program Specialist<br/>Counselor<br/>Psychologist<br/>Curriculum Specialist</p>
<p>Number of Days:</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>213</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>VI. Individual Education Plans (IEP)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall schedule lEPs during the unit members’ contract work-day<br/>(excluding the prep period). When lEPs are scheduled as such, a substitute<br/>teacher will be provided to cover the teacher’s class.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bargaining Unit Member has the right to decline to participate in an IEP during</p>
<p>their preparation period. In an emergency (no more than once per month) a<br/>Bargaining Unit Member may be asked to participate in an IEP meeting during<br/>her/his prep period.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an IEP or 504 meeting finishes within one hour after the Bargaining Unit<br/>Members’ contract day ends, that time shall be considered part of “activities<br/>conducted beyond the standard teaching workday, which are directly related to<br/>a Unit Members’ subject area... are considered a part of the standard teaching<br/>assignment.” “Such activities include individual conferences...” (GEA Contract<br/>Article 8, page 26, lines 577-581)</p>
<p>Example: The school day ends at 2:30 PM and the meeting goes to 3:30 PM,<br/>the Bargaining Unit Members will not be paid for the time spent in the IEP<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the IEP or 504 meeting extends beyond one hour after school, the Unit<br/>Members shall be paid at the Unit Member’s hourly per diem rate (Annual<br/>salary including anniversary increment/185 days, divided by 5 hours) Example:<br/>The school day ends at 2:50 PM and the IEP meeting ends at 4:50 PM— the<br/>Unit Member is paid for one hour.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>VII. Autism Authorization</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to pay for training up to the cost of what the County charges</p>
<p>for Special Education Teachers that volunteer to obtain an Autism Authorization<br/>in compliance with credentialing requirements.</p>
<p>The District will pay upfront for any course offered through the San Diego<br/>County Office of Education or will reimburse up to the cost of the County course<br/>for a different course.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Stipend of $1000 shall be paid to each teacher upon completion of the core</p>
<p>course.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a phase in plan with two teachers per site that are chosen by lot per</p>
<p>fiscal year.</p>

<p>117</p>
<p>2014-2015 REGULATIONS GOVERNING INITIAL PLACEMENT ON SALARY SCHEDULE</p>
<p>Initial placement on the Salary Schedule shall be limited to a maximum of 25 years. Any combination of years of</p>
<p>teaching experience, work-related experience as specified in Regulation No. 4, and military service as specified in</p>
<p>Regulation No. 5, may be used for initial salary placement, provided the placement does not exceed 25 years.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for previous teaching shall be limited to 25 years. Each year of full-time teaching, or its equivalent, allowed<br/>shall count for one step on the salary schedule. A year of teaching shall be defined as eight or more months in one<br/>school year, five days or more a week, or its equivalent.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit shall be given for all full-time, or its equivalent, night school, day school, or private school teaching on all<br/>levels in accredited schools.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit will not be given for practice or cadet teaching, substitute or teacher aide and teacher assistant service.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related work experience may be credited by the Professional Advancement Committee (PAC) at the rate of two<br/>years' full-time experience for one step on the salary schedule, limited to a maximum of two steps upon<br/>recommendation of the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources. Appeal for credit must be decided by the<br/>PAC. See Board Policy #4131.7</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for active military and Peace Corps service is limited to a maximum of two steps, at the rate of one step for<br/>every two full years' service (1 year of service = 12 months).</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees with the earned doctorate (from a WASC, Sr., or related regional accredited college or<br/>university) will receive an additional dollar amount equal to 3% of Class 3, Step 1 on the Certificated Salary<br/>Schedule, provided their job description does not specify the doctorate as required for the position they hold.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only degrees and units from a WASC, Sr., or related regional accredited college or university will be approved for<br/>class placement. Proper salary class and step placement is a joint responsibility of the employee and the District.<br/>Each teacher is encouraged to keep up-to-date records of college courses he/she has completed and other<br/>accomplishments which apply toward salary class advancement. Should a teacher suspect that he/she is<br/>incorrectly placed on the salary schedule, he/she should bring this information to the attention of the District<br/>immediately.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that an incorrect salary placement results in an underpayment, the District will make an adjustment as<br/>soon as possible. Should the incorrect salary placement result in an overpayment, the District is required to<br/>recover the full amount of such overpayment.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a District-caused payroll error result in overpayment to a bargaining unit member, the District will<br/>immediately meet with the bargaining unit member and his/her representative to facilitate an affordable repayment<br/>plan.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees are required to maintain a current set of college transcripts in the Human Resources office<br/>to verify placement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Schedule reclassifications shall be made as they occur. It is the responsibility of the individual teacher to<br/>request any change of class placement on the proper form and submit an official transcript. Actual implementation<br/>will most likely occur the month following receipt of the proper documentation. Step placement will be automatic,<br/>provided the individual has been employed for 75% of the days of the work year.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designated Subjects credential will advance a certificated employee to Class 1 effective when a bachelor’s degree<br/>is achieved. It is the responsibility of the individual teacher to request this change on the proper form and submit<br/>an official transcript. Actual implementation will most likely occur the month following receipt of the proper<br/>documentation.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining a valid teaching credential and fulfilling renewal requirements set forth by the Commission on Teacher<br/>Credentialing is an employment requirement. In the event that a certificated employee does not have a valid<br/>credential and the Governing Board grants a request for an emergency credential, salary placement will be<br/>corrected to reflect Classification 1.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired members who are employed by the District shall be placed on the Step and Column from which they<br/>retired, based on the Certificated Salary Schedule.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROTC teachers shall be placed in accordance with the JROTC and NJROTC Instructors’ Salary Placement<br/>Procedures.</p>

<p>C. If no one at the site wants the position, then a unit member from the district pool<br/>shall be selected based on the following criteria in this order by the district summer school<br/>director:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credential</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer School rotation (longest time without teaching summer school takes<br/>priority)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Seniority</p>
<p>(e.g. If no one from the school site wants to teach English, then the position would go to a<br/>person in the “district pool” [district pool is established with applications for the a current<br/>summer school position] with an English credential who wants to teach English in summer<br/>school, gets the position.)</p>
<p>Regardless of rotation/seniority, all librarians will have the option of working at their<br/>own school. If there are two librarians at a school, seniority will be the deciding factor<br/>with the position being rotated the second year. Those schools where the librarian elects<br/>not to serve in summer school, seniority will be the determining factor in selecting a<br/>librarian from those who are interested. Thereafter, rotation will be developed based upon<br/>seniority.</p>

<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>The following shall serve as a guideline for staffing the instructional program.</p>
<p>I. AVERAGE CLASS SIZES</p>
<p>Average class sizes should be within the range established for each subject<br/>department (see below). Individual classes may be larger or smaller than the maximum<br/>and minimum indicated by the established range. Suggested department average class</p>

<p>Class size shall remain consistent with department ranges except as follows:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrepancy between class enrollments per period shall not exceed, plus or<br/>minus, ten percent (10%) from the average of the department.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, overall teacher class loads should be within ten percent (10%), plus<br/>or minus, of the average of the department.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding physical education and performing arts, no class shall exceed 40 (33<br/>for Quarter Schools) students.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In week two of the semester, GEA and the district will review any class<br/>exceeding the 40 (33 for Quarter Schools) student cap to determine whether an<br/>exception should be made.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselor to Student ratios shall be a District average of 1/455 and not</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>more than 1/500.</p>
<p>II. EMERGENCY</p>
<p>Due to the absence of a standardized state adopted formula for financing public<br/>education, it is possible that an interim provision by the state legislature for providing<br/>funds for the schools could cause a significant and unforeseen decrease in income for the<br/>Grossmont Union High School District. A significant and unforeseen decrease in income<br/>could force the Governing Board to establish expenditure priorities which would<br/>necessitate the District class size guidelines being exceeded.</p>
<p>///</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General policies:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall provide each unit member with access to a computer that<br/>can be used in a classroom.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall provide each Unit Member with legally purchased and<br/>licensed software for each computer workstation and/or network necessary for<br/>the support of educational programs provided by the district.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall provide the Unit Member with appropriate training.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class sizes for computer-based classes shall be governed by Article 6.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members shall have reasonable use of workstations, software, printers,<br/>faxes, copiers, and other peripherals for personal work if it is not for a<br/>personal business, and is done outside their normal work hours.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the fact that technological devices and software are changing<br/>rapidly and that no contract provision can foresee the nature of these<br/>changes, the District and the Association agree to meet to address such<br/>issues.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telephones, Cell Phones and Voicemail:</p>
<p>All Unit Members shall have a telephone available in their classroom that</p>

<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-mail:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members shall have the right to use email (or other online<br/>communication) to communicate with other employees of the district, other<br/>individuals and/or organizations so long as the communication is within the<br/>scope of their professional responsibilities. Bargaining unit members shall<br/>not be disciplined for unsolicited receipt of inappropriate material.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have reasonable use of the district email to<br/>communicate with its Unit Members.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall have his/her email monitored except by an authorized<br/>administrator and with the unit member’s knowledge except during<br/>investigations of criminal activity or of safety issues.</p>
<p>Electronic Records:</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members teaching on-line courses shall have the same contract rights<br/>and assignment rights and expectations as other Unit Members.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year the district shall offer classes that instruct Unit members in distance<br/>learning, thus creating a pool of unit members who may teach on-line classes.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video taping of instruction to be televised later shall be made only with the<br/>Unit Member's prior written approval and notice to the Association. Additional<br/>compensation for broadcast, rebroadcast, use or sale of Online Learning<br/>material shall be subject to written mutual agreement between the Association<br/>and the district.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations of Unit Members assigned to Online Learning classes shall be in<br/>accordance with the evaluation procedures in this Agreement.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>WORKLOAD</p>
<p>I. STANDARD TEACHING ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>The principal, after consultation with the department chairs, shall determine the daily<br/>time schedule for unit members pursuant to this Article.</p>
<p>The standard teaching assignment shall be six (6) periods per day including a<br/>preparation period. Assignments of 60 percent (60%) or more include a preparation<br/>period; assignments less than 60 percent (60%) do not include a preparation period. A<br/>normal teaching assignment period shall be sixty-one (61) minutes including passing time.<br/>This period may be reduced or increased by the site principal, but it shall not decrease or<br/>increase the total amount of time that a unit member shall remain at school. If the daily<br/>schedule for students is divided into modules of time greater or less than six (6) periods,<br/>the standard teaching assignment shall be equivalent, in classroom time, to the classroom<br/>time of the normal six (6) period day. All unit members are entitled to a thirty (30) minute<br/>duty-free lunch.</p>
<p>Unit members will normally be assigned five (5) periods of instruction per day or<br/>twenty-five (25) hours and twenty-five (25) minutes per week, plus a daily preparation<br/>period which may be used for class preparation, curriculum development, or other<br/>professional tasks. Counselors, psychologists, and speech therapists shall identify five<br/>hours per week as preparation time (these hours may be flexible) to do paperwork and<br/>other tasks associated with their positions. During the preparation period, the unit member<br/>should be on campus and available for parent conferences, substituting, curriculum work,<br/>and other professional activities. It is recognized that at times it may be necessary for the<br/>unit member to leave campus and, provided permission is granted by the site supervisor,<br/>this can be accommodated. School work and other professional responsibilities will take<br/>precedent over any type of personal business or physical exercise activities during a<br/>preparation period.</p>
<p>During a preparation period, the principal or his/her designee, may assign a unit</p>
<p>member to substitute for another unit member when there is an unanticipated absence.</p>
<p>This assignment during the preparation period shall not exceed three (3) substitute</p>
<p>assignments per school year for a unit member with a full-time contract; two (2) substitute</p>
<p>assignments per school year for a unit member with an 80 percent (80%) (4/5), or</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>equivalent, contract; and one (1) substitute assignment per school year for a unit member<br/>with a 60 percent (60%) (3/5), or equivalent, contract. In the event these assignments<br/>exceed three (3), the unit member will be paid the hourly substitute rate for each addition¬<br/>al assignment over three (3). Such assignments shall be made as impartially as possible<br/>among unit members.</p>
<p>Insofar as it is possible, during the time school is in session each day, the duties of<br/>unit members shall be directly related to their classroom assignments.</p>
<p>Activities conducted beyond the standard teaching workday, which are directly<br/>related to a unit member's subject area or general school activities involving faculty<br/>participation in support of the educational program, are considered a part of the standard<br/>teaching assignment. Such activities include individual conferences, faculty meetings,<br/>department or committee meetings, club and class advisor ships, open house,<br/>back-to-school night, and meetings with parents.</p>
<p>Faculty assistance at athletic, social activities and student performance activities<br/>shall be paid at a rate of $10 per hour. Unit members may be asked to volunteer.</p>
<p>II. STANDARD TEACHING DAY</p>
<p>A standard teaching day is defined as that period of time a unit member is required<br/>to be on campus in the standard teaching assignment. The standard teaching day begins<br/>fifteen (15) minutes before, and ends fifteen (15) minutes after, the unit member's<br/>standard teaching assignment. In addition, assignments may be made as set forth below:</p>
<p>A split assignment is any regular assignment which consistently extends the day<br/>beyond the standard teaching day.</p>
<p>A multi-school assignment is an assignment that takes place at more than one (1)<br/>site. The teaching day for unit members with a multi-school assignment shall be the same<br/>as a standard teaching day, except those unit members shall be required to report a<br/>minimum of five (5) minutes before, and five (5) minutes after, the assignment and shall<br/>receive mileage.</p>
<p>No unit member shall work a split assignment or multi-school assignment in the day<br/>school program except by mutual agreement. Assignments for non-classroom unit<br/>members shall begin fifteen (15) minutes before the standard teaching assignment<br/>(normal six-period day) and end fifteen (15) minutes after the standard teaching<br/>assignment. Curriculum specialists, program specialists and librarians are on duty with no<br/>preparation period provided.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>During days that the normal schedule is adjusted (for example, Testing,<br/>Collaboration, etc.), unit members are not required to be on campus during any<br/>instructional periods for which they do not have a regular assignment. For example, on a<br/>Collaboration Day, a teacher assigned periods 2-7 who has collaboration prior to period<br/>1, is not required to remain on campus during period 1; on an afternoon Collaboration<br/>Day, a teacher assigned periods 1 - 3 is not required to remain on campus after period 3.<br/>During a Testing schedule, a teacher who is assigned periods 1 - 6, is not required to be<br/>on campus during period 7.</p>
<p>Unit members will be required to remain on campus beyond the standard teaching<br/>day only for those specific duties in this Article.</p>
<p>III. WORKLOAD</p>
<p>A unit member shall teach no more than twenty-five (25) hours and twenty-five (25)<br/>minutes per week except by mutual consent of the District and the unit member involved.<br/>A unit member teaching a sixth period will be reimbursed for this extra assignment at one-<br/>fifth (1/5) of the salary according to his/her placement on the salary schedule for all<br/>certificated workdays.</p>
<p>For the 6/5<sup>th</sup> assignment starting second semester, the faculty workday preceding<br/>and succeeding is paid. If an assignment begins subsequent to the student start date, pay<br/>will begin on the first day of the assignment.</p>
<p>For the term of this contract, unit members shall render 185 days of service per year<br/>to the District.</p>
<p>When making assignments within each school, the site administrator shall make<br/>every effort to limit assignments to no more than two (2) subjects, excluding individualized<br/>instruction. Realizing the need to limit the number of teacher preparations as much as<br/>possible, any assignment with more than three (3) preparations will be discussed with the<br/>affected unit member and the department chairperson. All parties shall strive for mutual<br/>agreement before any deviation in assignment is made. If mutual agreement cannot be<br/>reached, the site administrator shall present, in writing, the rationale to the unit member<br/>and the department chairperson for making the assignment.</p>
<p>The District shall consult with the Association concerning the work calendar each<br/>year. The District will negotiate the beginning and ending dates of the work calendar with<br/>the Association and consult with the Association on other work calendar issues.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>A. TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN ASSIGNMENT (See Form following Article).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated reduction in assignment is voluntary for the unit member, must<br/>be approved by their supervisor, and cannot be valid beyond the school year<br/>in which the reduction initially takes place. If the unit member wishes to<br/>continue the reduction beyond one school year, a new Temporary Reduction<br/>Request will be required.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member pay will be reduced commensurate with the reduced<br/>assignment and service credit with STRS/PERS will be affected.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for medical benefits, unit members must work at least fifty percent<br/>(50%).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of District seniority, attainment of permanency, step and<br/>column advancement and contractual status, time spent on a reduced<br/>assignment will be equivalent to time spent in a full (1.0) FTE assignment.</p>

<p>TRANSFER/REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITION OF TERMS</p>
<p>Transfer. The movement of a unit member from one school to another.</p>
<p>Voluntary Transfer. A unit member initiated transfer.</p>
<p>Administrative Transfer. A District initiated transfer.</p>
<p>Responsible Administrator. The person having the highest level of direct<br/>responsibility for the program to which the unit member is assigned.</p>
<p>Vacancy. Any vacated or newly created position, or a position resulting from a<br/>change in classification of a unit member.</p>
<p>Unassiqned Unit Members. Those unit members who are in an overstaffed<br/>department at a site because of a decline in enrollment, or a reduction in programs or<br/>services.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL GUIDELINES</p>
<p>A list of all vacancies is posted on Ed-Join (<a href="http://www.edioin.org">www.edioin.org</a>). Any unit member may<br/>request that the Human Resources Department send the list of vacancies directly to<br/>him/her at his/her job location. Such requests must be renewed every three (3) months.</p>
<p>Unit members shall be given first consideration for filling any vacancy. Unit<br/>members shall be given notice of any anticipated administrative transfer as soon as<br/>possible after it becomes known to the responsible administrator.</p>
<p>All unit members shall receive written notice of the next year's tentative assignment<br/>prior to the end of the school year. In the event a transfer is initiated after the end of the<br/>school year, the applicable transfer procedure shall be utilized.</p>
<p>The transfer of a unit member shall be based primarily on the needs and interests of<br/>the District. Transfers shall not be made for arbitrary, capricious, or vindictive reasons.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be considered before any transfer is made:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-balanced staff relative to program, staff, and students needs.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member training, recent teaching experience, and credentials held.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of the District's affirmative action objectives.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement of unassigned unit members.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member preference.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>F. District seniority shall be the deciding factor when all other qualifications are<br/>equal.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOLUNTARY TRANSFER</p>
<p>To be considered for a voluntary transfer, a unit member must submit a request to<br/>the Assistant Superintendent/Associate Administrator, Human Resources. The request<br/>may be submitted at any time during the school year, but must be submitted by May 1, if it<br/>is to be considered for the next school year.</p>
<p>Voluntary transfers shall be made according to the factors listed in the general<br/>guidelines of this Article.</p>
<p>The Assistant Superintendent/Associate Administrator, Human Resources, shall be<br/>actively involved in matching transfer requests with school needs and promoting transfers<br/>with principals. As part of the transfer process, the Assistant Superintendent/Associate<br/>Administrator, Human Resources, shall:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarantee that permanent District unit members are given an interview.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work to reduce any stigma attached to transfers by supporting District unit<br/>members desirous of transferring.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the concept of transfer is recognized as a healthy and rejuvenating<br/>process for unit members.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a mentoring program at sites to facilitate a successful transfer.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promote transfers with the understanding that if a transfer is being personally<br/>requested by the Assistant Superintendent/Associate Administrator, Human<br/>Resources, consideration has been given to what is in the best interest of the<br/>unit member and needs of the school and said transfer should be given priority<br/>by site administration.</p>
<p>If a voluntary transfer is denied, the unit member shall, upon request, be given a<br/>written rationale for the denial from the responsible administrator. The unit member who is<br/>denied the change may request, and will be granted, a meeting with the responsible<br/>administrator and/or the department chairperson to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADMINISTRATIVE TRANSFER</p>
<p>An administrative transfer shall occur when there are staff imbalances, a reduction<br/>in enrollment, or a reduction in programs or services.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Any proposed administrative transfer shall involve discussion and input from the unit<br/>member and the department chairperson. If the unit member objects to the transfer, a<br/>good faith effort shall be made to find an acceptable solution to the pending change.</p>
<p>Any unit member administratively transferred during the school year shall be given,<br/>upon request, three (3) release days prior to the beginning of the new assignment.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNASSIGNED UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>All unassigned unit members will be placed in an assignment for which they are<br/>qualified before any vacancies are advertised.</p>
<p>The responsible site administrator shall inform all members in the overstaffed<br/>department of the projected Districtwide vacancies and seek volunteers who may wish to<br/>transfer to these vacancies. The administrator shall then inform the Human Resources<br/>Department of those staff interested in existing vacancies. Placement of volunteers shall<br/>be according to the Voluntary Transfer section of this Article. If no unit member of the<br/>department volunteers to transfer and the department remains overstaffed, the<br/>responsible administrator shall attempt to reassign the unit member to another<br/>department/discipline for which the unit member is qualified to render service at that<br/>school. Reassignments shall be made according to the Voluntary Transfer section of this<br/>Article. If the department in question remains overstaffed, the responsible administrator<br/>shall declare a unit member as unassigned.</p>
<p>When declaring a unit member unassigned, the responsible administrator shall<br/>consider this Article's general guidelines for transfer. Consideration shall also be given<br/>both to special assignments of the unit member(s) involved, which cannot be legally or<br/>adequately performed by other unit members of the staff, and to the District seniority of<br/>the unit member. Criteria for determining special assignments shall be in consultation with<br/>the site department chairperson's council.</p>
<p>If a position becomes available at the school which declared unit members as<br/>unassigned, and the unassigned unit member is qualified for the vacancy, he/she will<br/>have the option of returning to that school provided it can be done at the beginning of a<br/>semester and is within three (3) years of the date of the original transfer.</p>
<p>VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VOLUNTARY REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>To be considered for a voluntary reassignment, a unit member must submit a written<br/>request to the site administrator. The request may be submitted at any time during the</p>
<p>school year, but must be submitted by April 15 to be considered for the next school year.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>VII. CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District employees assigned to the charter schools shall receive equal treatment to the<br/>teachers at the charter when it comes to room assignment, class loads, schedule, staff<br/>development, decision making, etc.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of Section VII is to ensure a collegial relationship for District employees<br/>working at the Charter Schools with charter administration and staff. The District and the charter<br/>will follow all provisions of the labor contract for special education employees working at Charter<br/>Schools, unless otherwise negotiated between the District and GEA.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contract provision will also provide assurances for the remedy of issues in which<br/>Charter Schools administration, GEA, and/or District has an employee relations matter to be<br/>addressed within the scope of the contract.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific provisions are as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District will hire and assign special education employees to Charter Schools in<br/>accordance with GEA Contract - Management Rights Article and the<br/>Transfer/Reassignment Article. The District’s Designee will be the Director of<br/>Special Education.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District will evaluate special education employees assigned to Charter Schools<br/>in accordance with the GEA Contract Evaluation Article. The District’s Designee<br/>referred to in the Evaluation Article will be the Director of Special Education or<br/>designee who shall be employed by the Grossmont District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GEA and District agree to bargain the calendar for the charters if different<br/>from the calendar for the Grossmont district. Additional time worked will be<br/>paid at the special education employee’s regular hourly/per diem rates.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 11</p>
<p>LEAVES</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STATE AND FEDERAL MEDICAL LEAVE ACT</p>
<p>The leave provisions for Personal Necessity, Personal, Illness, Maternity, Paternity,<br/>Child Care and Unpaid Leave of Absence shall comply with the California Family Rights<br/>Act and the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act. To the extent that contract provisions<br/>provide greater family or medical leave benefits, those benefits shall be continued.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAMILY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP ACT</p>
<p>Unit members shall be granted use of leave consistent with the language of the<br/>legislation.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>ILLNESS LEAVE</p>
<p>Unit members under contract with the District for the school year shall be granted<br/>full-paid sick leave.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the school year, full-time unit members shall be vested with<br/>sick leave, as follows:</p>
<p>185 contract workdays = 10 days of sick leave<br/>186-199 contract workdays = 11 days of sick leave<br/>200 - 211 contract workdays = 12 days of sick leave<br/>Over 211 contract workdays = 13 days of sick leave</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than full-time unit members shall be vested with a prorated number of<br/>days of sick leave based on the percentage of full-time work.</p>
<p>The above leave shall be cumulative year-to-year and, under law, is transferable to<br/>any other school district in the state of California. Leave taken for personal necessity shall<br/>be deducted from sick leave, but no more than ten 10 days of sick leave may be used for<br/>personal necessity in any one year. After all earned leave set forth above is exhausted,<br/>additional non-accumulated leave shall be available for a period not to exceed five (5)<br/>school months; provided the provisions set forth in this Article are met. The amount<br/>deducted for leave purposes from the unit member’s salary during the five (5) month<br/>period shall be the amount actually paid a substitute employee employed to fill the<br/>position during the leave, or, if no substitute is employed, the amount which would have<br/>been paid to a substitute. The five (5) month period shall begin on the first day after all<br/>accumulated sick leave has been exhausted. For purposes of this Article:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month period<br/>shall run consecutively.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall not be provided more than one five-month period per<br/>illness or accident. However, if a school year terminates before the five-month<br/>period is exhausted, the unit member may take the balance of the five-month<br/>period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>When a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave, including accumulated<br/>sick leave, and continues to be absent on account of illness or accident for a period<br/>beyond the five-month period provided herein, and the unit member is not medically able<br/>to resume the duties of his/her position, the unit member shall, if not placed in another<br/>position, be placed on a reemployment list for a period of 24 months if he/she is on<br/>probationary status, or for a period of 39 months if he/she is on permanent status. When<br/>the unit member is medically able, during the 24- or 39-month period, the unit member<br/>shall be returned to employment in a position for which he/she is credentialed and<br/>qualified. The 24-month or 39-month period shall commence at the expiration of the five-<br/>month period provided herein. The Associate Administrator/Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Human Resources, or designee may require said unit member to present a signed<br/>statement from a licensed physician/practitioner, or an acceptable signed verification of<br/>illness, for any absence.</p>
<p>After all paid illness leaves have been exhausted, unpaid medical/health care leave<br/>may be granted at the discretion of the Governing Board to any member. The provisions<br/>of the leave shall be determined by the Governing Board.</p>
<p>Prior to returning to work, the unit member shall provide a written licensed<br/>physician’s or practitioner’s statement as to the fitness of the member to resume his/her<br/>normal duties.<br/><a href="https://sfx.guhsd.net">https://sfx.guhsd.net</a></p>

<p>PERSONAL NECESSITY LEAVE</p>
<p>A maximum of ten (10) days in any school year may be deducted from sick leave<br/>and used for personal necessity for unit members. Personal necessity leave requiring the<br/>unit member's absence from his/her regular duties may be taken for any reason which is<br/>of a serious nature, is reasonably beyond the control of the unit member and cannot be<br/>taken care of during non-duty time. Said leave shall not be used for vacation, or for any<br/>matter pertaining to a unit member's personal business involving an auxiliary income.</p>
<p>Advance notification to the Associate Administrator/Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Human Resources, or designee, shall be required except for the following reasons:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a unit member, or his/her immediate family, or one<br/>designated in a will or codicil.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving unit member's person or property, or the person or property<br/>of a unit member’s immediate family.</p>
<p>The unit member will attest that the personal necessity leave meets the above<br/>criteria in this Article.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>PERSONAL LEAVE</p>
<p>Five (5) days of personal leave shall be granted if the unit member pays for the cost<br/>of a substitute.</p>
<p>Advance notification shall be required prior to the unit member taking personal<br/>leave. Normally this leave will not be allowed for a leave on the first day of school, the last<br/>day of school, or an extension of any legal holiday.</p>
<p>Such leave may also be used as an extension of bereavement leave, personal<br/>necessity leave, or illness leave.</p>
<p>Said leave shall not be used for vacation, or for any matter pertaining to a unit<br/>member's personal business involving an auxiliary income. No more than three percent<br/>(3%) of unit members at any work location shall be eligible for such leave at any one time.</p>
<p>Two (2) days of personal leave may be utilized by unit members for other reasons of<br/>a compelling personal nature without advance notification to the District. Unit members<br/>using these days shall pay the cost of a substitute teacher, and shall understand that the<br/>use of these personal leave days reduces the work year full-time equivalency reported to<br/>the State Teachers’ Retirement System for retirement purposes.</p>
<p>Unit members may not use personal leave provisions on staff development days<br/>financed under the terms of Senate Bill 1193. Extenuating circumstances outside of the<br/>control of the unit member shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may be<br/>approved by the District as an excused absence.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of the Catastrophic Leave Bank is to create a bank of sick leave days<br/>from which eligible unit members (as defined in Section VII) may apply for additional sick<br/>days when they or their family members (as defined in Section IV E) are suffering from<br/>catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AUTHORIZATION</p>
<p>Section 44043.5 of the California Education Code authorizes the governing boards<br/>of school districts to establish a Catastrophic Leave Program to permit employees to<br/>donate eligible leave credits on a voluntary basis as defined below.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESTABLISHMENT</p>
<p>The District shall establish a Catastrophic Leave Bank (“Bank”) to which all unit<br/>members may donate earned and unused sick days.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illness or injury: An injury or illness that is expected to incapacitate<br/>the unit member or member of her/his family (as defined in Section IV E) for an<br/>extended time (in excess of thirty [30] days), and which causes the unit member<br/>to exhaust fully paid sick leave and any Workers’ Compensation benefits.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity and/or child care leaves shall not be considered catastrophic unless<br/>qualified as defined.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible leave credits: Sick leave accrued to the donating unit member.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donation, deposit, contribution: These terms are interchangeable for the<br/>purposes of this Article.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family member is defined as a spouse, domestic partner, son, daughter,<br/>mother, or father.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee (“Committee”) shall administer the</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Bank. The Committee:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall consist of three (3) members appointed by the Association.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall designate one of its members as Chairperson.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall approve and designate appropriate forms for donating and requesting<br/>catastrophic leave credits.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be responsible for providing, approving, or denying requests for<br/>withdrawal from the Bank, and shall require a medical doctor’s letter before<br/>considering any claim.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall require an additional medical review by a physician if a participant has<br/>drawn twenty (20) days from the bank and requests an extension, or in the case<br/>of a unit member that has a terminal illness, twenty-five (25) days.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall consider the number of days requested, the number of unit members<br/>requesting withdrawals, and the status of the credits remaining, and need of the<br/>unit member requesting the Bank days.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall communicate their decision in writing to the requesting unit member and<br/>the Human Resources Department who, in turn, shall notify the Payroll Office<br/>within five (5) workdays of receipt of the request.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall establish appropriate recordkeeping procedures including the total<br/>number of accumulated days in the Bank and the names of the donors and<br/>participating members.</p>
<p>.1 All decisions of the Committee shall be final and the decisions are not subject to<br/>appeal.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All records and information obtained by the Committee that relate to the unit<br/>member’s health, family, or employment status shall be confidential.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will solicit additional days of contribution if the number of days<br/>in the Bank falls below fifty (50). Catastrophic Leave Bank unit member<br/>participants who are drawing from the Bank at the time of the assessment will<br/>not be required to contribute to remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank unit member participant has no remaining sick leave<br/>at the time of the assessment, she/he need not contribute the additional day to<br/>remain a participant in the Bank.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISTRICT RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>Upon receipt of donation and/or withdrawal requests, the District shall:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide the names of all unit members who have joined or are currently<br/>enrolled in the Bank, two weeks after the end of the enrollment period to the<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verify an applicant’s sick leave to the Committee.</p>

<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks before the donation period (the month of October), send to each<br/>unit member, a notice outlining the purpose of the Bank, and whether or not the<br/>member has already donated to the Bank, and attach a Bank donation form.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When necessary (when the Catastrophic Leave Bank falls below 50 days), the<br/>District shall solicit unit members for donations of sick leave for the Bank.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute between the Committee and the District as to the accounting of<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank days shall be immediately submitted to binding<br/>arbitration without the need to follow earlier steps of the grievance procedure as<br/>per the contract.</p>
<p>VII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>Use of this Bank shall be available to all active unit members who have served at<br/>least one year (at least seventy-five percent [75%] of the school year) in the District and<br/>who have made a donation of at least one (1) day to the Bank. Exemptions to this<br/>restriction shall be any unit member who was absent due to approved catastrophic illness<br/>allowed under this Article at the time of open enrollment. The unit member shall have<br/>thirty (30) calendar days from the time of return to apply for the Bank and shall have a<br/>waiting period of thirty (30) calendar days after contributing to the Bank before becoming<br/>eligible.</p>
<p>Unit members may join the Bank only during the open enrollment period (October)<br/>and must have a waiting period of thirty (30) calendar days before becoming eligible to<br/>withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>The unit members on a Board-approved leave shall not be eligible to apply during a</p>
<p>leave of absence. Unit members returning from a Board-approved leave of absence shall</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>have thirty (30) calendar days from the first day of employment to sign up for participation<br/>in the Catastrophic Leave Bank if the open enrollment period has expired.</p>
<p>VIII. DONATIONS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks before the donation period (October), the Human Resources<br/>Department shall send to each unit member a notice outlining the purpose of<br/>the Bank, whether or not the member has already donated to the Bank and<br/>attach a Bank donation form.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All donations made by unit members shall be voluntary and are irrevocable.<br/>Contributions shall be made in October.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Catastrophic Leave Bank falls below fifty (50) days, the District shall<br/>solicit unit members for donations of sick leave for the Bank as soon as<br/>possible to allow for a bank of days to be created immediately.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional donations will be assessed from each participant if the number of<br/>days in the Bank falls below fifty (50) days. Such assessments shall be made in<br/>writing and approved by the unit member if they wish to continue participation in<br/>the Bank. Unit members who are drawing from the Bank at the time of the<br/>assessment will not be required to contribute in order to remain eligible to<br/>receive benefits from the Bank.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may contribute a maximum of two (2) days in any one year.<br/>Donations of less than one day will not be accepted.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A donation to the Bank shall be a general donation, and shall not be donated to<br/>a specific unit member for her/his exclusive use.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All donations are irrevocable, and the unit member waives any right to days<br/>she/he may have donated except as stated in this Article.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>IX. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USE OF CATASTROPHIC SICK LEAVE BANK</p>
<p>Eligible unit members who suffer a catastrophic illness or injury as defined herein<br/>may request withdrawal of days from the Bank under the following terms:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are current members of the Catastrophic Leave Bank (have made a<br/>contribution to the Bank).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have submitted written verification of the catastrophic illness or injury by a<br/>medical doctor and are prepared to provide additional documentation on the<br/>nature and severity of the illness or injury if requested by the Committee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have requested a specific number of days not to exceed twenty (20) days<br/>unless the unit member has a terminal illness (verified by doctor's note), in<br/>which case, withdrawal grants may be up to twenty-five (25) days. Participants<br/>may request extensions or additional days as their grants expire. The maximum<br/>withdrawal of leave credits for a single illness/injury shall not exceed fifty (50)<br/>days.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the unit member may reasonably be presumed to be eligible for disability<br/>retirement under STRS, PERS, or, if applicable Social Security, he/she may be<br/>required to apply for such retirement or disability.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the unit member to submit a complete application, including medical<br/>information provided by the applicant’s physician, within twenty (20) calendar<br/>days, will disqualify the unit member from further Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>benefits.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll must verify the unit member requesting the withdrawal has exhausted all<br/>fully paid sick leave, or the date when this will occur. The Chair of the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Committee shall convene a meeting as soon as possible to<br/>consider the withdrawal request.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No days shall be granted retroactively.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All leave granted shall be in one day increments (not hours).</p>
<p>X. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE COMMITTEE SHALL:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chair of the Committee shall convene a meeting as soon as possible to<br/>consider a withdrawal request.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request that Payroll verify the unit member requesting the withdrawal has<br/>exhausted all fully paid sick leave or convey to the committee the date when<br/>this will occur.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant withdrawals of no more than twenty (20) days unless the unit member<br/>has a terminal illness (verified by doctor's note), in which case, withdrawal<br/>grants may be up to twenty-five (25) days. Participants may request extensions<br/>or additional days as their grants expire. The maximum withdrawal of leave<br/>credits for a single illness/injury shall not exceed fifty (50) days.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep all information confidential.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Committee denies a request for the withdrawal due to insufficient days,<br/>the unit member making the request shall be notified in writing of the reason for<br/>denial.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Committee has insufficient days to fund a withdrawal request neither the<br/>Committee nor the District shall be under any obligation to provide benefits to<br/>the unit member.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any days approved by the Committee that are not used by unit members shall<br/>be returned to the Bank.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be donated and withdrawn from the Bank without regard to the daily<br/>rate of pay of the unit member. Unit members using days from the Bank shall<br/>receive pay for that day at their daily rate of pay.</p>
<p>XI. DENIAL OF REQUESTS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No days granted from the Bank may be used for illness or disability that<br/>qualifies a unit member for Workers’ Compensation.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have been denied a request for days may amend and<br/>resubmit their request.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are injured or become ill while on an unpaid leave of absence<br/>are not entitled to use the Bank until such time as they are scheduled to return<br/>from the leave and have exhausted their accumulated sick leave and differential<br/>leave.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Committee has insufficient days to fund a withdrawal request, neither the<br/>Committee nor the District shall be under any obligation to pay the unit member.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Committee denies a request for the withdrawal due to insufficient days,<br/>the unit member making the request shall be notified in writing of the reason for<br/>the denial.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All decisions of the Committee shall be final and not subject to appeal.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval or denial of requests is at the discretion of the Committee.</p>
<p>XII. TERMINATION OF CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK</p>
<p>If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in<br/>the Bank shall be equally distributed to the current members of the Bank.</p>
<p>Ill</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT/ILLNESS LEAVE</p>
<p>A unit member shall be granted a leave of absence with pay when he/she is absent<br/>due to an industrial accident or illness in accordance with the following regulations:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leaves shall be for a maximum of sixty (60) working days per accident in<br/>any fiscal year. In the event that the sixty (60) days will overlap into the next<br/>fiscal year, the unit member shall be entitled to the amount of the unused leave<br/>due him/her for the same injury or illness.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leaves shall not be cumulative from year to year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary received from the District during such leave, plus wage loss benefit<br/>checks received under workers' compensation laws, may not exceed the unit<br/>member's regular salary. Therefore, all benefit checks received by the unit<br/>member under workers' compensation shall be endorsed to the District and the<br/>District shall pay the unit member his/her normal salary during the period of<br/>leave. If the unit member is injured during the regular work year while on duty<br/>and he/she has filed intent to teach summer school (applied and has received<br/>notice of tentative employment either on or before May 15), any industrial<br/>accident leave shall continue during the summer school period.</p>
<p>After exhausting this leave, a unit member may use regular sick leave, vacation,<br/>and any other compensated time off to cover absences caused by industrial<br/>accident/illness.</p>
<p>Regular sick leave shall be earned during an industrial accident/illness leave but will<br/>be reduced by the number of days so credited if the unit member cannot return to work to<br/>complete his/her contract.</p>
<p>When all paid leaves of absence have been exhausted by a unit member as a result<br/>of industrial accident/illness, such unit member may, at the discretion of the Governing<br/>Board, be placed on a health leave of absence without pay. Such leave is normally<br/>granted for one year only but may be extended on a year to year basis. If a unit member<br/>has not sufficiently recovered by the end of the leave period, he/she shall retire (if<br/>eligible), resign, or be subject to dismissal for reasons of health. Application for<br/>reemployment for such unit member will be given full consideration when accompanied by<br/>evidence of full recovery and ability to meet current employment standards. If a unit<br/>member who was classified as a permanent employee is rehired within thirty-nine (39)</p>
<p>1342 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months after his/her last day of paid service, the Governing Board shall restore to him/her</p>
<p>1343 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all rights, benefits and burdens of a permanent unit member as provided by law.</p>
<p>1344 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quarantined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;County&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or</p>
<p>1345 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts an illness as a result of contact with a student and/or employee in the normal</p>
<p>1346 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course of his/her duties, this absence shall be considered as part of industrial</p>
<p>1347 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accident/illness leave.</p>

The<br/>statement must include the estimated date of delivery, that the unit member is<br/>in good health and can continue to carry on her assigned duties and<br/>responsibilities without danger to herself or the child.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of sick leave (pursuant to Education Code 44965 and 44978) for<br/>pregnancy related disability shall be treated the same as any other disability for<br/>which sick leave is granted. In order to use sick leave for pregnancy disability,<br/>the unit member must have actually rendered paid service to the District<br/>immediately prior to the disability.</p>

<p>The Board may grant sabbatical leave to unit members after every seven (7) years<br/>of service in the District to engage in study, travel, work-related experience, or an<br/>individual project. Such leave shall be for: One (1) year or one (1) semester at fifty<br/>percent (50%) of regular salary, or for one (1) semester at one hundred percent (100%) of<br/>salary.

A second application, for the<br/>nonconsecutive semester, must also adhere to the application deadline. The second<br/>semester of the leave shall not be considered part of the three percent (3%) allocation for<br/>the year during which it is taken.</p>

<p>66</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an application is made for purposes other than study, the applicant shall<br/>submit a written proposal for approval. Such program shall indicate the<br/>expected values to be derived for the District and the unit member from the<br/>activities to be pursued.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications shall be submitted by the first Friday in February for sabbatical<br/>requests for the following school year or semester thereof.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should an application hinge on the receipt of a scholarship, fellowship, or<br/>exchange teaching opportunity, the applicant shall validate the tentative<br/>application at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptance or rejection of the application will be based on what is presented to<br/>the Professional Advancement Committee by the application deadline;<br/>therefore, the typed application should contain all applicable information<br/>requested for the Professional Advancement Committee to evaluate.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An application for the remaining semester of a year's leave previously<br/>authorized may be made at any time within a three (3) year period, providing<br/>the February deadline for applications is observed. The second semester of<br/>leave shall not be considered part of the three percent (3%) allocation for the<br/>year during which it is taken.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALLOCATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of unit members who may be granted sabbaticals in any one (1)<br/>year shall be determined on the deadline date in February in accordance with<br/>the established allocation of up to three percent (3%) of unit members who may<br/>be granted sabbaticals in one (1) year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approval of sabbaticals for up to three percent (3%) of the unit members,<br/>no additional applications will be approved as a result of anyone's removing<br/>himself/herself from the list because plans for the leave failed to materialize.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPROVAL OF SABBATICAL REQUESTS</p>
<p>All applications for sabbaticals will be submitted to the principal or site administrator<br/>and the Professional Advancement Committee (PAC) representative. The PAC will make<br/>recommendations to the Governing Board.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPENSATION DURING LEAVE</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member participating in a work-related sabbatical leave shall not receive<br/>a total yearly combined compensation greater than what he/she would have<br/>received if he/she had remained in their District certificated position for that<br/>year.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any sabbatical related materials/products produced during the leave shall<br/>become the property of the Grossmont Union High School District.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report of not more than five hundred (500) words showing that the unit<br/>member has accomplished the objectives outlined in his/her original<br/>application and how the experience has contributed to the improvement of<br/>the unit member’s teaching, professional preparation, and/or the District’s<br/>educational program, and</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, an individual project will include the completed project which will<br/>be a usable product and available to District personnel.</p>
<p>If the report is unacceptable to the Governing Board, it shall give the unit member<br/>reasons why it is unacceptable and shall give him/her the right to rewrite the report. If the<br/>revised report is still unacceptable to the Governing Board, there shall be a review by the<br/>PAC and its recommendation submitted to the Governing Board. After reviewing the<br/>recommendation, if the Governing Board still finds the report unacceptable for valid<br/>reasons, the unit member shall immediately reimburse the District the compensation paid<br/>to him/her by the District during the sabbatical.</p>
<p>The completed application is, in essence, a contract. Changes in course work or study,<br/>work-related plans, and/or an individual project must be approved, in advance, by the<br/>PAC.</p>

<p>Notes for Part I:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaboration days are every Wednesday. Collaborative time is to meet with colleagues. School¬<br/>wide collaborative day meetings are restricted to once each month.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70% approval of unit members is required. If fewer than 70% approve the 7-period day<br/>schedule, we revert to the &quot;normal'' 6-perlod schedule with no collaboration.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No teacher shall be assigned a 1 - 7 period schedule.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not voting counts as a NO vote, which is a vote for a 6 period day.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vote does not make the seven-period day permanent. If 20 percent of the faculty signs a<br/>petition to trigger a review of the most recently implemented schedule, a new restructuring ballot<br/>will be created and a vote taken on the format of the next year's schedule. A maximum of two<br/>votes (ballots) are allowed per year .</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 6 period schedule allows for no collaboration days and no minimum days. Teachers agree<br/>not to penalize a student who must travel across campus who is late to class by no more than<br/>one minute.</p>

<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may suspend any pupil from the teacher's class, for any of<br/>the acts enumerated in Section 48900. for the day of the suspension and the day<br/>following. The teacher shall immediately report the suspension to the principal of the<br/>school and send the pupil to the principal or the principal's designee for appropriate<br/>action. If that action requires the continued presence of the pupil at the school site, the<br/>pupil shall be under appropriate supervision, as defined in policies and related regulations<br/>adopted by the governing board of the school district. As soon as possible, the teacher<br/>shall ask the parent or guardian of the pupil to attend a parent-teacher conference<br/>regarding the suspension. Whenever practicable, a school counselor or a school<br/>psychologist shall attend the conference. A school administrator shall attend the<br/>conference if the teacher or the parent or guardian so requests.

<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also refer a pupil,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for any of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acts enumerated in</p>
<p>Section &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48900, to the principal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the principal's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;designee for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consideration of a</p>
<p>suspension from the school.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pupil suspended from a class shall not be placed in another class during the<br/>period of suspension.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher of any class from which a pupil is suspended may require the<br/>suspended pupil to complete any assignments and tests missed during the suspension.</p>
<p>VII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON STUDENT DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>The Association and the District agree that unit members and the District have a<br/>responsibility to follow state law and Board policies concerning student discipline. The<br/>District shall notify unit members of disruptive and dangerous students as soon as they<br/>become aware of the behavior and history of such students. This includes teacher access<br/>to student discipline via the Student Information System. The District reserves the right to<br/>make all student academic placements. All student matters are to be kept confidential and<br/>past performance, or lack thereof, will not hinder a student’s future opportunity to receive<br/>an education. The Association and the District will cooperate in the dissemination of laws<br/>and policies concerning student discipline. General information concerning student<br/>discipline will be available in any teacher handbooks prepared by the District, or written<br/>Board policies.</p>
<p>VIII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAMERA AND MONITORING EQUIPMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intercoms and cameras used for communications and monitoring safety<br/>conditions shall not be used for the purpose of evaluation and/or discipline.</p>

<p>CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES<br/>It is the policy of the District that all instruction be fair, accurate, objective, and<br/>appropriate to the age and maturity of the student(s), and sensitive to the community<br/>needs as well as the needs and values of our diverse cultures and heritage. Academic<br/>freedom is essential to the fulfillment of this policy and the District acknowledges the<br/>fundamental need to protect unit members from any censorship or restraint which might<br/>interfere with the unit member's obligation to pursue truth in performance of their teaching<br/>functions.</p>
<p>A unit member shall have reasonable freedom in presentations and discussions and<br/>may introduce political, religious, or otherwise controversial material, provided that said<br/>material is relevant to the course content, and within the scope of the law.</p>
<p>A unit member shall not utilize his/her position to indoctrinate students with his/her<br/>personal, political and/or religious views. In performing professional duties, however, unit<br/>members shall have reasonable freedom to express their opinions, if identified as such,<br/>on all matters relevant to the course content.</p>

<p>VII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LEVEL IV-ARBITRATION</p>
<p>If the Grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level III, or no<br/>decision has been rendered, the Grievant may submit the grievance to the Association for<br/>determination of whether the matter will go to arbitration.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days of its receipt, the Association shall notify the Superintendent of a<br/>final decision to submit the grievance to arbitration. Regardless of the status of the<br/>contract (i.e. interim period between negotiated agreements) the Association shall have<br/>the right to move to arbitration. The statement of the decision to arbitrate shall include the<br/>appeal at each level, the decision rendered at each level, and a clear, concise statement<br/>of the reasons for the appeal. In such case, the parties shall request a list of arbitrators<br/>from the California State Conciliation Service. An arbitrator shall be selected by the<br/>following procedure:</p>
<p>A representative of each the Association and the District shall select the<br/>arbitrator from the California State Conciliation Services list by eliminating<br/>names until one name remains. The one remaining name shall be the<br/>arbitrator. The process of striking names shall occur within ten (10) days of<br/>receipt of the list. A coin flip shall determine if the Association or District will<br/>have first elimination. Once the arbitrator has been selected hearings shall<br/>commence at the convenience of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall conduct the<br/>hearings in accordance with the voluntary arbitration rules of the American<br/>Arbitration Association and the provisions of this procedure.</p>
<p>93</p>

<p>Witnesses shall be assured that their testimony will be kept confidential.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the arbitrator shall be confined to a determination of the facts and<br/>the interpretation of the provisions of the contract. The arbitrator will have no power to add<br/>to, subtract from, or modify the terms of this agreement or the written policies, rules,<br/>regulations, and procedures of the District.</p>
<p>The arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such financial<br/>reimbursements or other remedies as judged to be proper.</p>
<p>Each party shall bear the full costs for its representation in the arbitration. The cost of<br/>the arbitration shall be borne by the party not receiving the award. If the arbitrator's<br/>decision is split between the District and the Association, the cost shall be divided equally.<br/>If either party requests a transcript of the proceedings, that party shall bear the full costs<br/>of the transcript. If the parties mutually request a transcript, the total cost of the transcripts<br/>shall be divided equally between the parties.</p>
<p>VIII. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>Prior to the submission of a grievance to arbitration, either the Association or the<br/>District may request that a representative from the California Mediation and Conciliation<br/>Service attempt to resolve the grievance through mediation. Mediation recommendations<br/>will be advisory to the parties.</p>
<p>Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the number<br/>of days indicated at each level should be considered as a maximum and every effort<br/>should be made to expedite the process. The time specified, however, may be extended<br/>by written mutual consent.</p>
<p>In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all<br/>the levels in this grievance procedure by the end of the school year, the time limits set<br/>forth herein may be reduced so that the grievance procedure may be completed prior to<br/>the end of the school year, or as soon thereafter as it is practicable.</p>
<p>Any changes in representatives during this procedure shall be communicated to all<br/>parties-in-interest.</p>
<p>The parties-in-interest agree to make available to each other all pertinent non-</p>
<p>confidential, non-privileged information which is relevant to the issues raised by the</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>grievance. Copies of all non-confidential written opinions shall be made available to the<br/>grievant.</p>
<p>A decision rendered at any level shall be considered final unless an appeal is<br/>registered within the time limit specified. If a decision is not given to the Grievant within<br/>the time limit, an appeal may be taken to the next level.</p>
<p>No party-in-interest shall take reprisals against any unit member or any participant in<br/>the grievance process by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>Derogatory materials in a personnel file may not be used in a disciplinary proceeding<br/>if they are more than two (2) years old at the time the notice of proposed disciplinary<br/>action was given to the unit member.</p>
<p>A unit member may at any time request the Associate Administrator of Human<br/>Resources to remove specific derogatory materials from the personnel file. Removal of<br/>such materials is at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>Any record(s) pertaining to a grievance shall be kept in a grievance file separate from<br/>the Grievant's official District personnel file.</p>

<p>GROSSMONT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>Alternative Evaluation Program</p>
<p>Goal:</p>
<p>This evaluation program encourages teachers to continue their professional<br/>development and personal growth. The program is flexible to encourage teachers to<br/>grow in self-chosen areas of interest that promote student learning and instructional<br/>leadership. The program also hopes to strengthen collegial relationships, cooperation,<br/>and to decrease teacher isolation.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The program is an individual exploration of alternatives to the traditional process of<br/>evaluation. It is based on the premise that professional educators are capable of<br/>setting meaningful goals which will serve as a focus for their professional growth for<br/>that year That individual professional growth becomes the basis for the evaluation for<br/>the year The teacher, together with the site principal, establishes criteria for the<br/>evaluation of that growth. The program emphasizes the need for personal reflection<br/>and for collaboration between the teacher and the principal.</p>
<p>Participants are permanent teachers with a minimum of five years of teaching<br/>experience with the most recent evaluation rating of &quot;meets standards.&quot;</p>
<p>The teacher develops goals that become the basis for his/her professional growth and<br/>evaluation for the school year. At a conference held early in the fall, the teacher and<br/>administrator meet, discuss, and agree upon these goals. They establish the criteria<br/>and the option to be used for the evaluation of those goals. They also need to schedule<br/>approximate dates for two short evaluation conferences throughout the year. The<br/>purpose of these brief conferences will be to discuss that teacher’s progress toward<br/>his/her goals.</p>
<p>The need for collegial dialogue about the practice of teaching and teacher goals is an<br/>important factor. As we move the focus away from a teacher-centered evaluation to<br/>that of student performance, the goals should include some of the following:</p>
