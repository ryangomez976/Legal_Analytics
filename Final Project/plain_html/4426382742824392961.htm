<p>16.6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before any involuntary transfer takes place, the District shall first<br/>seek volunteers from among those members at the site.</p>
<p>16.6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers shall have the option of selecting any open position in the<br/>District for which they are qualified.</p>

These three (3) days shall be taken during the<br/>summer recess period, if possible.</p>
<p>16.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If requested, the District shall provide moving service before the start of the new<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>16.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member involuntarily transferred shall receive first right of refusal to<br/>return to the school from which they were transferred for a period of up to twelve<br/>(12) calendar months. Human Resources will maintain a list of all involuntary<br/>transfers and contact the unit member both orally and in writing, should an<br/>opening occur. If the unit member declines the opening, the first right of refusal<br/>shall no longer apply, with the exception of Article 16.6.7.1.</p>
<p>16.6.7.1 If an opening occurs within the twelve (12) months at the school</p>
<p>from which a bargaining unit member was involuntarily transferred,<br/>the transferee may elect to return to that school. In the event that the<br/>bargaining unit member elects to remain in the new assignment for<br/>the balance of the first school year, the unit member may exercise<br/>this right to return at the beginning of the following school year, if a<br/>vacancy exists.</p>
<p>16.6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particular school is to be closed, then unit members at that school shall be<br/>accorded first priority for filling any new or vacant positions at the school or<br/>schools at which the students at the closing school are being placed for the coming<br/>school year.</p>
<p>16.6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member from the closed school shall also be accorded first priority for<br/>filling all vacancies that arise for which they have an appropriate credential. If two</p>
<p>or more unit members apply for the same vacancy, and if all factors are equal, as<br/>deemed by the administrator, the unit member with the greatest seniority shall<br/>receive the position.</p>

<p>20.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above requirement of verification may be waived for eight (8) days of<br/>personal leave taken under this provision for reasons that the unit member need not<br/>share with the District, nor shall any District employee ask the reason. Under no</p>
<p>circumstances shall the leave provided in this provision be used for taking a<br/>holiday or for purposes of extending a holiday or vacation, or for use as a<br/>recreational activity, or for matters of personal convenience which can reasonably<br/>be taken care of outside the work hours.

The length of such disability leave,<br/>including the date on which the leave shall commence and the date on which the<br/>duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the unit member and the unit<br/>member's physician; however, the District management may require a verification<br/>of the extent of disability through a physical examination of the unit member by a<br/>physician appointed by the District at the District's expense.</p>
<p>20.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to leave without pay or other benefits for disabilities<br/>because of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom when<br/>personal illness and injury leave as set forth in 20.3.1 has been exhausted.

<p>examination of the unit member by a physician appointed by the District at<br/>District's expense. The unit member may retain participation in District<br/>health/welfare benefits if the unit member pays the full amount of the premium for<br/>the benefits.</p>
<p>20.6.3 The unit member on leave for pregnancy disability shall be entitled to return to the<br/>same position, unless the position is eliminated, then to a comparable position to<br/>that held at the time the leave commenced.

<p>20.13.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member wishes to take intermittent leave, and that leave<br/>would cause the unit member's absence from his/her assignment more<br/>than twenty (20) percent of the time, the unit member may be required<br/>either to take continuous leave throughout the treatment period or to be<br/>placed in an equivalent position that would not be disruptive to the<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>20.13.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be required to extend leave through the end of a<br/>semester if he/she would otherwise have returned within the last three<br/>weeks of the semester's end, depending on the date on which the leave<br/>commenced and the duration of the leave.</p>

<p>20.13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall retain his/her employee status with the District during the<br/>leave period. The leave shall not constitute a break in service for the purposes of<br/>longevity, seniority, or any employee benefit plan.</p>

<p>20.14.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of contribution by each participating unit member for<br/>each school year shall be one (1) day of personal illness and injury<br/>leave which shall be deemed to equate to the legal minimum required<br/>by Education Code 44043.5.</p>
<p>20.14.2.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional day of contribution will be requested of<br/>participants if the Executive Committee determines that<br/>the Bank is close to depletion. Unit members may<br/>volunteer to put in an additional day that year outside the<br/>initial contribution period.</p>
<p>20.14.2.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Executive Committee determines that the number<br/>of days in that Bank at the beginning of the school year<br/>are more than adequate and exceed the anticipated needs<br/>of the members, no contribution shall be required of<br/>continuing unit members who contributed the prior year.<br/>Those unit members joining the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>for the first time and those returning from leave, shall be<br/>required to contribute one day to the Bank.</p>
<p>20.14.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are retiring or leaving the employ of the District<br/>may contribute their unused personal illness and injury leave to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>20.14.3 Withdrawal from the Bank</p>
<p>20.14.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants, whose personal illness and<br/>injury leave is exhausted, may withdraw from the bank for catastrophic<br/>illness or injury. Catastrophic illness or injury shall be defined as any<br/>illness or injury that incapacitates the unit member for over ten (10)<br/>consecutive duty days (as defined in 17.1.4 of the Contract) or<br/>incapacitates an immediate family member (as defined in 20.5.2 of the<br/>Contract) for over ten (10) consecutive duty days which requires the<br/>unit member to take time off work to care for that family member. If a<br/>reoccurrence or a second illness or injury incapacitates a unit member<br/>or a member of a unit member's family within twelve (12) months, it<br/>shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5) consecutive duty days.</p>
<p>20.14.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must use all personal illness and injury leave (but, not<br/>differential leave) as defined in Article 20.3, available to them before<br/>eligible for a withdrawal from the bank.</p>
<p>20.14.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants who have exhausted personal illness and injury leave, but<br/>still have differential leave available are eligible for a withdrawal from<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The district shall pay the participant full<br/>pay and the Bank shall be charged one-half (1/2) day.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>20.14.3.4</p>
<p>20.14.3.5</p>
<p>20.14.3.6</p>
<p>20.14.3.7</p>
<p>20.14.3.8</p>
<p>20.14.3.9</p>
<p>20.14.3.10</p>
<p>The first ten (10) duty days of illness or disability must be covered by<br/>the participant's own personal illness and injury leave, differential<br/>leave, or leave without pay the first time said participant qualifies for a<br/>withdrawal from the bank. For subsequent withdrawals within twelve<br/>(12) consecutive months, the first five (5) duty days of illness must be<br/>covered by the participant's own personal illness and injury leave,<br/>differential leave, or leave without pay.</p>
<p>Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in<br/>units of no more than thirty (30) duty days. Participants may submit<br/>requests for extensions of withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A<br/>participant's withdrawal from the Bank may not exceed the statutory<br/>maximum period of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>The catastrophic leave recipient, because he/she remains in paid<br/>District status, shall continue to receive District fringe benefit<br/>contributions for the duration of said leave.</p>
<p>Participants applying to withdraw from the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>will be required to submit a doctor's statement indicating the nature of<br/>illness or injury and the probable length of absence from work. This<br/>information shall be kept confidential.</p>
<p>If a participant is incapacitated, the participant’s agent or member of<br/>the participant’s family may submit applications to the Executive<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>If a participant has withdrawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>days and requests an extension, the Executive Committee may require<br/>a medical review by a physician of the Executive Committee's choice<br/>at the participant's expense. The Executive Committee shall choose<br/>only a physician who qualified under the District offered insurance<br/>policy. Refusal to submit to the medical review will terminate the<br/>participant's continued withdrawal from the Bank. The Executive<br/>Committee may deny an extension of withdrawal from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank based upon the medical report or the number<br/>of credit days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The participant may<br/>appeal any termination under the procedures outlined in Section</p>
<p>20.14.3.14 below.</p>
<p>Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which<br/>qualify the participant for Worker's Compensation benefits unless the<br/>participant has exhausted all Worker's Compensation leave, his/her<br/>own personal illness and injury leave, and differential pay, and<br/>provided further that the member signs over any Worker's<br/>Compensation checks for temporary benefits to the District. If there<br/>are any Worker's Compensation checks signed over to the District, or</p>
<p>if the Worker's Compensation payment is equivalent to a regular day<br/>of pay at the negotiated rate for that participant, the Bank will not be<br/>charged days.</p>
<p>20.14.3.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Executive Committee may reasonably presume that the<br/>applicant for a draw may be eligible for a Disability Award or a<br/>Retirement under STRS or, if applicable. Social Security, the<br/>Executive Committee shall request that the draw applicant apply for<br/>disability or retirement. Failure of the draw applicant to submit a<br/>complete application, including medical information provided by the<br/>applicant's physician, within twenty (20) calendar days will disqualify<br/>draw applicant for further Catastrophic Leave Bank payments. Any<br/>requests for additional medical information from STRS or Social<br/>Security shall be submitted within ten (10) days or the participant's<br/>entitlement to Catastrophic Leave Bank payments will cease. If denied<br/>benefits by STRS or Social Security, the applicant must appeal by<br/>submitting the reason for denial, or entitlement to the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank shall cease.</p>
<p>20.14.3.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a<br/>withdrawal request, neither the Review Committee nor the District is<br/>under any obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If<br/>the Review Committee denies a request for withdrawal because of<br/>insufficient days to fund the request, they shall notify the participant in<br/>writing of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>20.14.3.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals and difference pay become effective immediately upon<br/>the exhaustion of personal illness and injury leave or the waiting<br/>periods provided for in Section 20.14.3.4.</p>
<p>20.14.3.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are denied a withdrawal or<br/>whose withdrawal is not renewed or is terminated may, within thirty<br/>(30) days of denial, appeal the denial, non-renewal, or termination to<br/>the Review Committee.</p>
<p>20.14.3.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall provide representation to an appealing<br/>participant, unless the appellant refuses representation. If the<br/>participant's incapacitation does not allow participation in this appeal<br/>process, the participant's agent or member of the family may process<br/>the appeal.</p>
<p>20.14.4 Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>20.14.4.1 The District and Upland Teachers Association shall share the<br/>responsibility of maintaining the records, receiving withdrawal<br/>requests, verifying the validity of requests and the status of the<br/>requesters' personal illness and injury leave, and communicating that</p>

<p>If denied, the applicant has ten (10) duty days to request a review of<br/>their application by the Catastrophic Leave Bank Review Committee.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee and the Review Committee shall keep all<br/>records confidential and shall not disclose the nature of the illness<br/>except as is necessary to process the request for withdrawal and defend<br/>against any appeals of denials.</p>

<p>under current federal and California state laws in the course they are assigned to</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>teach. In the event that there are insufficient applicants to teach the number of<br/>courses offered or if a 9-12 summer school course does not require specific federal<br/>or California state qualifications, unit members may be assigned to teach a summer<br/>school course based on their previous experience in similar grade levels or content<br/>areas. In all instances, unit members that are highly qualified under current federal<br/>and California state laws in the particular subject matter they are being assigned to<br/>teach, shall be given first priority over unit members without such qualification.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members hired to teach summer school in grades PreK-8 must be either:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highly qualified under current federal and California state laws in the<br/>particular subject matter they are being assigned to teach or</p>

<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who meet the qualifications in Sections A through C above shall be<br/>hired to teach summer school based upon a rotation using the database in Section D<br/>above. Qualified unit members shall be hired in the order they appear on the</p>
<p>rotation, beginning at the top.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are hired to teach summer school will be moved to the bottom of<br/>the rotation list after two consecutive years of teaching summer school.</p>

A<br/>copy of the Letter of Unsatisfactory Performance must be provided to the<br/>unit member within 3 days of the conference. Letters of Unsatisfactory<br/>Performance shall not be placed in the unit member’s personnel file, but<br/>shall be placed in a summer school hiring file for the sole purpose of<br/>tracking summer school hiring eligibility.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of serious misconduct, the District may take disciplinary actions without<br/>following the progressive steps set forth in Section H above.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who has received a Letter of Unsatisfactory Performance for<br/>repeatedly failing to address a disciplinary directive within the course of a summer<br/>school session shall be taken off of the rotation in Section E for a period of two<br/>years. After the two-year period has ended, the unit member shall be placed at<br/>the bottom of the rotation.</p>

<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the extent as set forth in II below, the District agrees to maintain for the duration of this<br/>Agreement, the existing health and welfare benefit specifications.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will pay the full cost necessary for premiums for the existing dental, vision and<br/>HMO health and welfare benefits for full-time bargaining unit members, spouses,<br/>dependents and registered domestic partners for the duration of this Agreement or until a<br/>successor agreement is reached.</p>
<p>III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will pay the premium costs for the existing POS health and welfare benefits up<br/>to the total cost of the most expensive HMO plan for full-time bargaining unit members,<br/>spouses, dependents and registered domestic partners for the duration of this Agreement or<br/>until a successor agreement is reached.
