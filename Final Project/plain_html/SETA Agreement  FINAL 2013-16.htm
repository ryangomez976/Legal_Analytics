It is the intent of this informal level that at least one personal conference be<br/>held between the grievant and the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FORMAL LEVELS</p>
<p>7.3.1 Level 1: Within ten (10) days after the grievant knew, or reasonably should have<br/>known of the circumstances which form the basis for the grievance, the grievant<br/>must present the grievance in writing to the immediate supervisor, or designee<br/>(see Appendix C, Grievance Report Form.) This written grievance shall be a<br/>clear, concise statement of the grievance, the article of this Agreement alleged to<br/>have been violated, the circumstances involved, the decision rendered at the<br/>informal conference, and the specific remedy sought. The supervisor or designee<br/>shall communicate a decision to the teacher in writing within fifteen (15) days<br/>after receiving the grievance.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2: In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level 1, the<br/>grievant may appeal the decision in writing to the Superintendent or designee<br/>within ten (10) days following said decision. This written appeal should include a<br/>copy of the original grievance, the article of this Agreement alleged to have been<br/>violated, the decision rendered at level 1, and a clear, concise statement of the<br/>reasons for the appeal. The Superintendent or designee shall communicate a<br/>decision within ten (10) days after receiving the appeal.</p>
<p>7.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3: If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of this grievance at<br/>Level 2, or if no written decision has been rendered within ten (10) days after he<br/>has first met with the Superintendent, or his designee, he may, within ten (10)<br/>days after a decision by the Superintendent, or his designee, request in writing<br/>that the Association submit his grievance to the Board. The Board will review the<br/>grievance documentation and take oral testimony.</p>
<p>7.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 4: If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his grievance at<br/>Level 3, or if no written decision has been rendered within ten (10) days after he<br/>has first met with the Board, or its designee, he may within ten (10) days after a<br/>decision by the Board, or its designee, request in writing that the Association<br/>submit his grievance to binding arbitration. The Association, by written notice to<br/>the Board within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the request from the grievant,<br/>may submit the grievance to binding arbitration. (If any question arises as to the<br/>arbitrariness of the grievance, such question will be ruled upon by the arbitrator<br/>only after he has an opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.)</p>
<p>7.3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator from a list<br/>provided to them by the California State Conciliation Service<br/>(CSCS).</p>
<p>7.3.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth his<br/>findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted.<br/>The arbitrator’s decision shall be binding upon the parties.</p>
<p>7.3.4 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator including but not limited</p>
<p>to, per diem expenses, his travel and subsistence expenses and the<br/>cost of any hearing room will be borne equally by the Board and<br/>the Association. All other costs will be borne by the party<br/>incurring them.</p>
<p>7.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant has the right to have a representative at any step of</p>
<p>the grievance procedure. Any teacher may present grievances relating to a<br/>contract dispute to his employer and have such grievances adjusted without the<br/>intervention of the exclusive representative or employee organization as long as<br/>adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement. The District shall<br/>not agree to the adjustment or resolution of the grievance until the exclusive</p>
<p>representative or employee organization has received a copy of the grievance and<br/>the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>

<p>ARTICLE X - CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEE EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>10.1 It is understood and agreed by the evaluator and evaluatee that their principle objective is<br/>to provide quality education in the District.</p>
<p>It is also understood that the evaluation program, in its design and operation, is intended<br/>to provide an open communication process and a supportive environment in which to<br/>improve performance of certificated employees.</p>
<p>The District and the Association accept as a fundamental premise for a successful<br/>evaluation program the necessity for mutual respect and confidence to exist between the<br/>evaluator and those evaluated. The District will provide the necessary training for those<br/>engaged in the process of evaluation to assure a level of competence to achieve this<br/>respect and confidence for the evaluator and evaluatee. Multi-site personnel shall be<br/>evaluated by their immediate supervisor(s) who have that service provided in their school<br/>site. All other teachers shall be evaluated by the designated administrator or an<br/>administrator agreed upon by the evaluatee and the District Superintendent.</p>
<p>10.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation program shall evaluate certificated teachers’ performance as it<br/>reasonably relates to the following:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of pupils towards the standards of expected pupil<br/>achievement at each grade level in each area of study.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s adherence to curricular objectives.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment,<br/>within the scope of the employee’s responsibilities.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasonable criteria as defined by the District, such as adherence to<br/>policy, rules and regulations as established by the District to be reviewed<br/>annually (see 10.1.4).</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Evaluation Report shall acknowledge special activities of the<br/>employee that enhance the school environment such as mentoring, peer<br/>support, grant writing and other extra-curricular activities. (See Appendix<br/>E, Evaluation Report)</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of non-instructional certificated employees, evaluation and assessment<br/>of performance will be conducted as it relates to duties and responsibilities of the<br/>job description.</p>
<p>10.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Article, the definition of Evaluation Plan shall be the plan submitted to the<br/>evaluator by October 1 of each year that outlines the annual goals, possible<br/>strategies to achieve the goals, and methods of measurement. The goals that are<br/>submitted on the Evaluation Plan should reflect the following: pupil achievement;<br/>instructional techniques and strategies, curriculum, and learning environment.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Plan shall be a dynamic, interactive, living document that informs<br/>the entire process from preconference to final evaluation report.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>10.1.4 The evaluation procedures and plans shall be reviewed annually through</p>
<p>negotiations to ensure effectiveness and uniformity. Any additional criteria to be<br/>used in the evaluation process the following year shall be reviewed.</p>
<p>10.2 Procedure</p>
<p>10.2.1 Probationary teachers shall be evaluated formally once each year.</p>
<p>10.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent teachers shall normally be evaluated at least once every two years.<br/>Teachers will be evaluated the year following an overall unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation. Teachers will be evaluated upon a request of the teacher or the year of<br/>a change in instructional assignment.</p>
<p>10.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members who have been employed at least ten (10) years in the<br/>District, who are certified as Highly Qualified under ESEA, and whose most<br/>recent evaluation has indicated he/she has met standards, if the evaluator and<br/>evaluatee agree, the evaluation shall be made every five (5) years. Either the<br/>affected unit member or evaluator may withdraw consent at the beginning of a<br/>school year, no later than October 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Process</p>
<p>10.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 1, teachers will submit Evaluation Plan to the evaluators. Evaluators<br/>shall meet with teachers to review teacher’s Evaluation Plan by October 15. The<br/>plan shall be reviewed and mutually agreed upon at this conference. (See<br/>Appendix F.)</p>
<p>10.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the evaluator or evaluate cannot come to agreement on the<br/>contents of the work plan or any other elements of the evaluation process, a third<br/>party will be mutually selected to assist in resolving the disagreement.</p>
<p>Resolutions shall begin at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>10.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of the year, circumstances may arise that require modification<br/>of the work plan. The evaluatee and evaluator will review and come to mutual<br/>agreement on its revision.</p>
<p>10.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining the outcomes of the evaluation, it is recognized that there are many<br/>constraints and factors that may affect performance such as class size, intellectual<br/>abilities of the learners, availability of support personnel and facilities, student<br/>mobility, and class make-up.</p>
<p>10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation - Supervisory Process</p>
<p>10.4.1 It is the intent of the observation/supervision process to provide the evaluatee with<br/>ongoing and pertinent information regarding performance. All comments or</p>
<p>ratings to appear on the Final Evaluation Report should have been addressed and<br/>discussed during the Observation - Supervision Process.</p>
<p>10.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each evaluation shall be based upon at least two (2) observations. The evaluatee<br/>shall be given a minimum of two (2) days notice prior to the initial observation.<br/>This observation shall be no less than 20 consecutive minutes. After the initial<br/>observation, both scheduled and unscheduled in-class observations may be part of<br/>the evaluation process. These observations to be used as part of the evaluation<br/>shall be no less than 20 consecutive minutes.</p>
<p>10.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) teaching days, each observation shall be followed by an<br/>observation conference in which the evaluator and the evaluatee shall review the<br/>observation summary. Copies of the observation summary shall be given to the<br/>evaluatee at that time.</p>
<p>10.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of each observation summary shall be attached to the Final Evaluation<br/>Report and shall become a permanent attachment to his/her personnel file. (See<br/>Appendix G.)</p>
<p>10.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal observations are a part of the year-end evaluation report. Other<br/>evaluation data may be obtained through a variety of observations, visitations, and<br/>conferences between evaluator and evaluatee. Teacher may initiate and submit<br/>other written information through the course of the year to provide additional<br/>documentation for the Final Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>10.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator, within five (5) working days of an incident or known data that<br/>could result in an unsatisfactory rating or comment, shall notify the evaluatee of<br/>that problem area in writing (Notice of Concern form. Appendix D) in order to<br/>allow maximum opportunity to correct such deficiencies.</p>
<p>10.5 Recommendations and Follow-Up Procedures</p>
<p>10.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator’s written observation summaries during the supervision process<br/>shall contain acknowledgements of accomplishments where appropriate and shall<br/>contain specific recommendations on how the performance may be improved if<br/>the performance is deemed unsatisfactory. Comments regarding unsatisfactory<br/>performance shall be substantiated.</p>
<p>10.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall make specific recommendations to correct any cited<br/>deficiencies. The District shall provide assistance and supportive action in<br/>implementing such recommendations and, if appropriate, adequate release time<br/>for the teacher to meet such recommendations.</p>
<p>10.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator and the evaluatee shall then meet to write an improvement plan<br/>prior to the conclusion of the school year that will include specific<br/>recommendations for improvement, specific assistance offered to achieve</p>
<p>recommendations, a time schedule to monitor progress, and the manner in which<br/>achievement of recommendations will be measured.</p>
<p>10.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to reach agreement on any of the elements of the improvement plan shall<br/>necessitate that the evaluator and the evaluatee designate a third party, agreeable<br/>to both, to assist in resolving the disagreement. If the evaluatee does not agree<br/>with the improvement plan, he/she may attach a written response to the plan.</p>
<p>10.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evaluator and evaluatee agree that subsequent remedial action has<br/>eliminated the performance deficiencies, an amendment stating the improvements<br/>shall be attached to the original evaluation.</p>
<p>10.6 Evaluation Timeline</p>
<p>10.6.1 The Final Evaluation Report (see Appendix E) shall be given to the evaluatee<br/>(permanent and probationary teachers) no later than the first school day in May.<br/>Probationary teachers shall additionally receive an Evaluation Report midyear,<br/>prior to the first school day in February. The evaluatee shall have the right to<br/>initiate a written reaction or response. This shall become a permanent attachment<br/>to his/her personnel file.</p>
<p>10.7 General</p>

<p>10.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation and assessment of certificated employee performance pursuant to<br/>this section shall not include the use of publishers’ norms established by<br/>standardized tests.</p>
<p>10.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No teacher shall be held accountable for any aspect of the educational program<br/>over which he/she has no authority to correct.</p>
<p>10.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private life of a teacher shall not be part of the evaluation except as it may<br/>prevent the teacher from performing his/her assigned functions during the<br/>workday.</p>
<p>10.7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change of Primary Evaluator</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Upon request to the District Superintendent for a different evaluator on or before<br/>October 15, another district administrator will be assigned to complete the entire<br/>evaluation process. This option will be limited according to the number of<br/>requests, the reasons for the requests and the availability of other administrators<br/>outside of the school site.</p>
<p>10.8 Voluntary Supplemental Evaluation Strategies and Processes</p>
<p>10.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of supplemental evaluation strategies and processes to promote<br/>openness and creative approaches to the evaluation process particularly the<br/>collection of information for the Final Evaluation Report. Supplemental<br/>evaluation strategies and processes are voluntary and may, upon teacher selection,<br/>be included in the standardized process as defined in this article.</p>
<p>10.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing within this supplemental process shall be construed as a loss of any<br/>rights, benefits or legal obligation specified under Education Code 44660.</p>

<p>11.1.3 Grade Span Adjustment [GSA]</p>
<p>The average class sizes grades K - 3 at each individual school site shall not<br/>exceed 27 students.</p>
<p>11.2 For departmentalized grades 6-8, individual class loads will be no greater than the<br/>following:</p>
<p>English/Language Arts &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students</p>
<p>Band &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students</p>
<p>Physical Education &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students</p>
<p>All Other Classes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students</p>
<p>11.2.1 The maximum daily load for teachers of grades 6-8 shall be no greater than the<br/>following:</p>
<p>Band &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students</p>

<p>11.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overages will be assessed when the total enrollment of students exceeds<br/>the cumulative total of students for the total number of teachers. (E.g. for 3<br/>teachers assigned to a class, overages will be assessed for the 100<sup>th</sup> student<br/>enrolled. For 2 teachers, overages will be assessed for the 67<sup>th</sup> student enrolled.)</p>
<p>11.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assignment of students, physical education teachers may</p>
<p>distribute students among the individual class periods in a manner<br/>that best meets the needs of the program and best equalizes<br/>individual class sizes. Prior to such decisions, the physical</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>education teachers will seek concurrence with the site<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>11.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the overage in a physical education class period is necessary, a<br/>teacher will be identified, through concurrence with the District and SETA, to be<br/>compensated at the daily rate (see 11.2.2).</p>
<p>11.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the maximum class load is exceeded in grades 6-8, the teacher will be<br/>compensated at the rate of $3 per student per day for excess load by enrollment.<br/>(An overage caused by a student for the daily class load cannot be duplicated for<br/>an individual class period.)</p>

<p>11.2.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Functional working stations as applied to this contractual<br/>agreement is defined as work stations that require that equipment is<br/>operational so students can use it as an education aid. The District,<br/>after receiving notification from the teacher regarding the nature of<br/>a problem, will address the problem through repair or placement<br/>within a reasonable period.</p>
<p>11.2.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fully understood and agreed that during the reconstruction<br/>and/or modernization of the school campuses and while classes are<br/>assigned to temporary facilities, the necessary work stations as<br/>outlined in 11.2.6 may not be fully available until permanent<br/>facilities are available for use.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administrators shall have ten class days after the first day of actual student<br/>attendance to adjust class sizes and overages without payment of compensation as<br/>outlined in this article. However, should the overage exist on or after the eleventh day of<br/>actual student attendance, compensation shall be paid for retroactive overage.</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees that, in the event the Learning Center Model is agreed to by the Site</p>
<p>Principal and involved teacher at the specific school site, the class size shall not exceed<br/>28 to 1.

<p>14.17.1.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential<br/>health care facility; or</p>
<p>14.17.1.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a<br/>health care provider.</p>

<p>14.17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family care leave may be taken in one or more periods but shall not exceed a<br/>total of twelve (12) weeks in a fiscal year, unless a longer leave is agreed upon<br/>by the District and unit member.</p>
<p>14.17.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of Family Care Leave, the unit member may elect to use<br/>his/her accrued sick leave. Employees may use other paid or unpaid leaves<br/>provided in this Article. (See Government Code 12945.2)</p>
<p>14.17.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall continue to be entitled to participate in pension and<br/>retirement plans, and supplemental unemployment benefit plans to the same<br/>extent and under the same conditions as apply to an unpaid leave taken for any<br/>other purpose.</p>
<p>14.17.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall maintain the unit member’s group health benefits to the same<br/>extent as if the employee were not on leave.</p>
<p>14.17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member’s employment with the District is terminated (e.g. layoff or<br/>resignation) or if the employee does not return to work at the end of leave<br/>entitlement, the District shall cease providing benefits.</p>
<p>14.17.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee does not return to work at the end of the Family Medical Leave<br/>the District shall collect the cost of the health premiums that were paid during the<br/>length of the leave unless the unit member’s failure to return is due to a serious<br/>health condition (the unit member or unit member’s family) or other</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>circumstances beyond the unit member’s control.</p>
<p>14.17.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall retain his/her employee status with the District during the<br/>leave period, and the leave shall not constitute a break in service for purposes of<br/>longevity, seniority, or any other employee benefit plan. Unit members who are<br/>granted such leave shall be employed in the same or comparable position upon<br/>return from Family Care Leave.</p>
<p>14.17.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member’s need for family care leave is foreseeable, he/she shall give the<br/>District reasonable advance notice. If the leave is needed for a planned medical<br/>treatment or supervision, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule<br/>the treatment or supervision to avoid disruption of school or District operations.<br/>This scheduling shall be subject to the health care provider’s approval.</p>
<p>14.17.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member’s request for leave to care for a family member who has a<br/>serious health condition shall be supported by a certification from the health care<br/>provider of the person requiring care. This certification shall include:</p>
<p>14.17.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date on which the serious health condition began.</p>

<p>14.17.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimate of the amount of time the health care provider believes<br/>the unit member needs to care for</p>
<p>the person requiring care.</p>
<p>14.17.10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement that the serious health condition warrants the<br/>participation of a family member to provide care during a period of<br/>the treatment or supervision of the person requiring care.</p>
<p>14.17.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional leave is needed beyond the time that is certified by the health care<br/>provider, but within the 12 week allocation, the unit member shall provide<br/>recertification as specified above.</p>
<p>14.17.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may refuse to grant a request for family care leave if this refusal is<br/>necessary to prevent undue hardship as defined by the California Fair<br/>Employment and Housing Commission to school or district operations. In the<br/>event the District refuses to grant Family Care Leave, it shall not do so except for<br/>cause and shall provide the applicant with a written statement of the hardship<br/>which the District would suffer. Such statement shall be provided within five (5)<br/>calendar days of the unit member’s application for Family Care Leave.</p>
<p>14.17.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not refuse to hire and shall not discharge, fine, suspend, expel<br/>or discriminate against any employee because he/she exercises the right to<br/>Family Care Leave or because he/she gives information or testimony related to<br/>his/her or another person’s Family Care Leave in an inquiry related to family</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>leave rights.</p>
<p>14.17.14 In the event that both parents work for the District in any classifications, the</p>
<p>District shall not be required to grant both employees the Family Care Leave for<br/>the care of the same child that totals more than the amount specified in 14.17.2<br/>for one unit member, or require parents to take Family Care Leave concurrently<br/>for the care of the same child.</p>

<p>14.18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure<br/>14.18.3.1</p>
<p>14.18.3.2</p>
<p>Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate the unit member for an extended period of<br/>time or that incapacitates an immediate member of the unit<br/>member’s family.</p>
<p>The catastrophic illness or injury requires the unit member to take<br/>time off from work for an extended period of time. Taking<br/>extended time off from work will create a financial hardship for<br/>the unit member because he/she has exhausted all of his/her<br/>accrued sick leave and other paid time off.</p>
<p>“New Program Member” is a current unit member who has not<br/>previously enrolled in the catastrophic leave program, but who<br/>wishes to become a participant.</p>
<p>The unit member who is or whose immediate family member is<br/>suffering from a catastrophic illness or injury requests that sick<br/>leave be transferred from the leave bank and provides a physician’s<br/>verification of catastrophic injury or illness, or affirms</p>
<p>bereavement and files a Catastrophic Leave Form (Appendix_).</p>
<p>New form needed.</p>
<p>Superintendent or designee and SETA Cabinet shall review the<br/>application and confirm that the employee is unable to work due to<br/>verifiable catastrophic illness or injury or his/her family member’s<br/>catastrophic illness or injury and that the employee has exhausted<br/>all accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>14.18.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee and SETA Cabinet<br/>shall inform unit members of days dispensed from<br/>the leave bank.</p>
<p>14.18.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of donated catastrophic<br/>leave days that may be used by any unit member<br/>will not be more than 30 (thirty) days per academic<br/>year.</p>
<p>14.18.3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any catastrophic leave days that were approved but<br/>were not used shall be returned to the leave bank,<br/>which will be monitored by the District Office and<br/>an Association designee.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>14.18.3.2.4 In order to ensure the viability of the program if the<br/>total number of leave days in the bank drops below<br/>sixty (60) days, the District will notify SETA. Then<br/>a request for donations will go out to unit members<br/>to rebuild the bank to a minimum level.</p>
<p>14.19 Job Share Leave</p>
<p>14.19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition</p>
<p>Job Sharing is an arrangement whereby two teachers share the full<br/>responsibilities for one full-time position. Job sharing contracts shall be one year<br/>in length. At least one of the parties to a job share application must be a<br/>permanent teacher. If it is necessary to hire a teacher as one of the job share<br/>partners, the partner who is a permanent teacher shall participate in the selection<br/>process.</p>
<p>14.19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>Unit members desiring a job share assignment for the following school year shall<br/>submit an application (see Appendix K - Job Share Application) to the<br/>Superintendent no later than March 1. The Superintendent shall submit the<br/>request to the Board with his/her recommendation. The Board shall approve or<br/>deny requests and notify the applicants, in writing, of its decision no later than<br/>May 1. If a request is denied, the applicants shall be notified, in writing, of the<br/>specific reasons for the denial. Unit members wishing to continue the job share<br/>for a subsequent school year shall submit their request pursuant to the above.</p>
<p>The job share request will specify the benefits to the District and the students, as<br/>well as the benefits to the unit members involved. The written request will<br/>indicate the name(s) of the unit members who are proposing to job share, and it<br/>will indicate how the unit members plan to implement the job share position.</p>
<p>The request must show details of how the unit members intend to coordinate<br/>their work, insuring that the educational continuity of the class will be preserved.<br/>A unit member who has been approved for a job share will be granted a leave of<br/>absence for the portion of the assignment he/she is not working. Contracts with<br/>employees in job share positions shall clearly indicate that teachers shall honor<br/>their contract and will not be eligible for other positions in the District which<br/>conflict with the job share assignment.</p>
<p>Responsibilities for an assignment of two (2) job sharers may be divided or<br/>allocated according to the plan designed by the job sharers, with the concurrence<br/>of their immediate supervisor. It is the intent that job sharers fulfill their<br/>instructional duties based on the pro-ration of their employment contract.<br/>However, it is understood that the coordination of the classroom activities and</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>instruction between the job sharers will likely require more time than if a single<br/>teacher was responsible for the class. In addition, each job sharer shall attend at<br/>least a prorated share of the faculty meetings, grade level and department<br/>meetings (if applicable). Both unit members shall attend regularly scheduled<br/>parent conferences, if requested by a student’s parent or guardian. Both unit<br/>members will attend back-to-school nights and open-house nights.</p>
<p>Each job sharing unit member is responsible for notifying the District when a<br/>substitute is needed. The teaching team partner is entitled to first call for<br/>substitute service at the substitute rate. The job share partners may “cover for<br/>each other” rather than calling for a substitute.</p>
<p>Each job share shall be evaluated twice yearly. If found to have met the<br/>requirements, unit members shall be able to request to continue the following<br/>year without full reapplication. If the evaluation is less than satisfactory, an<br/>improvement plan must be submitted with a reapplication to the Board.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>ARTICLE XV - SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS</p>

In<br/>the case of less severe hazards, the District will notify the unit member of the<br/>results of the investigation and if necessary schedule corrective action.</p>
<p>15.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member believes that the results of the investigation are not acceptable,<br/>the unit member may appeal to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>15.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall comply with provisions of the California Occupational Safety<br/>and Health Act (CAL OSHA). (See <a href="http://www.dir.ca.gov">www.dir.ca.gov</a>)</p>

<p>15.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide TB testing by the school nurse at least once each school year.</p>
<p>15.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the District Superintendent or designee approves a field trip in which a unit<br/>member is attending, it is understood that the District does provide workers compensation<br/>insurance for injuries and liability insurance for unit members’ actions during the course<br/>and scope of the unit member’s employment. It is also understood that the unit member’s<br/>personal insurance is primary in the event of loss and/or damage to belongings or real<br/>property.</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an emergency school closure, the District will compensate unit members<br/>their daily rate of pay if the closure occurs within the workday. If the decision to close a<br/>school occurs prior to the school day, unit members will be subject to service during that<br/>day or on a make up day.</p>
<p>15.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will take every reasonable action to prevent harassment of unit members by<br/>parents, students, volunteers, or other District employees. Harassment for this provision<br/>shall be defined as unwelcome verbal, written, or physical contact.</p>
<p>15.8 Administration and staff will share joint responsibility for implementation of site<br/>discipline plans. Site level discipline plans will be reviewed by staff and principals<br/>annually, prior to the start of the student year, during paid staff time.</p>

<p>16.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall deduct from the above payments all required federal and state<br/>tax withholdings and other required payroll taxes.</p>
<p>16.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have until December 1 prior to payment to notify the<br/>District of their desire to change the amount of federal and state taxes withheld.<br/>Any changes must be provided to the District on the federal tax form W-4 and the<br/>state tax form DE-4.</p>
<p>48</p>
