<p>5.4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association and the Superintendent/designee agree in<br/>writing, the grievance may be brought directly to arbitration.</p>
<p>5.4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by a grievant to appeal a decision at any level within the<br/>specified time limit shall be deemed an acceptance of the<br/>decision.</p>
<p>5.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative procedure to 5.3.8 and 5.3.9, the District and<br/>Association may mutually agree to use the American Arbitration<br/>Association or arbitration may be held under the expedited rules<br/>of the American Arbitration Association.</p>

<p>unit member's personnel file, the evaluator shall rely only upon<br/>data collected through observations, and pre- and post¬<br/>evaluation conferences regarding the unit member's on duty<br/>responsibility. Any deficiencies which have been brought to the<br/>attention of the unit member, and subsequently corrected, shall<br/>not be deemed reason for an unsatisfactory rating in the final<br/>evaluation summary.</p>
<p>7.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit member shall have the right to initiate a written</p>
<p>reaction or response to the evaluation. Such response shall<br/>become a permanent attachment to the unit member's<br/>personnel file. Before the end of the school year, a meeting<br/>shall be held between the unit member and the evaluator to<br/>discuss the evaluation.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation and Follow-up Procedures:</p>

<p>member and to suggest reasonable methods where such<br/>deficiencies can be corrected.</p>
<p>An unsatisfactory rating shall not be given in any of the<br/>standards unless the evaluator finds practices not consistent<br/>with standards expectations in at least two (2) of the elements<br/>describing the standard. Unsatisfactory elements will be<br/>identified in the comments section of the appropriate standard<br/>in the summative evaluation. In the event of an unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation, the evaluator and evaluatee shall meet to write a<br/>work plan and time schedule for improvement(s) needed. Such<br/>work plan shall be developed prior to the end of the current<br/>school year unless the evaluator and evaluatee meet and agree<br/>to extend the deadline for the completion of the development of<br/>the work plan. If the unit member does not agree with the work<br/>plan and time schedule, he/she may attach a written response<br/>to the plan.</p>
<p>The work plan shall include:</p>
<p>7.8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas indicated as unsatisfactory;</p>

<p>74</p>
<p>ARTICLE 18 - HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members and eligible retirees are covered by the CalPERS Health</p>
<p>Program for medical benefits. The District shall contribute toward health<br/>benefits for full-time unit members and eligible dependents as follows<br/>(prorated &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part-time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members):</p>
<p>Ninety percent (90%) of the monthly premium rate per full time eligible<br/>employee.</p>
<p>As such, unit members shall be responsible for ten percent (10%) of the<br/>premium costs via payroll deduction.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical plans in effect under the 90/10 agreement are:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaiser HMO Plan</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue Shield HMO Plan</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERS Choice PPO Plan</p>
<p>These medical plans have been selected with the intent of offering a unit<br/>member a Kaiser HMO plan, a non-Kaiser HMO plan, and a PPO plan as<br/>options under the 90/10 agreement. However, should a unit member elect<br/>to choose another medical plan offered by CalPERS the District's maximum<br/>contribution shall be limited to the appropriate tier of the Kaiser HMO plan.</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, prior to September 30<sup>th</sup>, the District and VMTA will meet to agree<br/>on the plans that will be offered under the shared-cost agreement. Such<br/>plans will then be available on January 1 for unit member participation.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall receive that portion of the employee benefits allocations<br/>as their work week relates to a full-time work week.</p>
<p>18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District's contribution to the CalPERS health benefit program shall be<br/>offered as an employer contribution through a Internal Revenue Code 125<br/>plan.</p>
<p>18.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum employer contributions shall be pursuant to Government<br/>Code section 22892(b).</p>
<p>18.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing above the minimum employer contribution will be considered<br/>as a contribution to health benefits.</p>
<p>18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of any contract with CalPERS, the parties shall be bound by<br/>the rules and regulations governing that program, notwithstanding anything<br/>in the contract between the parties to the contrary.</p>
<p>18.7 Unit members on leave without pay are eligible to continue their health and<br/>dental benefits while on leave provided they prepay the premium.</p>
<p>DENTAL BENEFITS</p>
<p>18.10 The District shall contribute the premium costs for employee only in<br/>California's Valued Trust (CVT) Dental, with no annual maximum per calendar<br/>year. A unit member may enroll for dependent dental coverage by<br/>authorizing appropriate payroll deductions for the additional costs if criteria<br/>are met and the dental provider permits.</p>
<p>VISION BENEFITS</p>
<p>18.20 The District shall reimburse unit members for up to $120.00 annually for the<br/>unit member's vision services. Unit members shall submit receipts at the<br/>time of reaching or exceeding $120.00 or June 1 of each year, whichever is<br/>earlier.</p>
<p>RETIREE VESTING</p>
<p>18.30 For the purpose of participation in the CalPERS retiree health benefit<br/>program, retirees who have provided a minimum of thirty (30) years of<br/>service to the Sonoma Valley Unified School District, inclusive of shared<br/>contracts and reduced services employment plans, shall be entitled to the<br/>employer contribution to the CalPERS retirement program. This vesting shall<br/>not be pro-rated for service less than the thirty (30) year minimum.</p>
<p>OTHER</p>
<p>18.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall treat the employee's eight percent (8%) contribution to the<br/>State Teacher's Retirement System (STRS) as tax deferred income, subject<br/>to the applicable state and federal law.</p>
<p>18.41 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Article shall obligate the District if the health benefits provider<br/>cancels a plan, changes benefits or otherwise nullifies the benefits provided,<br/>except that an equal dollar amount, shall be provided as mutually agreed for<br/>insurance for affected unit members. In the event such change, cancellation<br/>or nullification occurs, the District and the Association shall agree to open<br/>negotiations immediately.</p>
<p>18.42 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members, hired before April 1, 1986, who elected Medicare coverage<br/>shall continue in the Medicare program. All unit members hired on or after<br/>April 1, 1986 shall automatically be included in the Medicare program.</p>
<p>18.43 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make available to unit members, on an optional basis, a<br/>Flexible Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify as a cafeteria plan under<br/>Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>18.44 Subject to carrier approval, retirees may remain in the medical and dental<br/>plans available by the District by paying the necessary premiums. If the<br/>District coordinates the retiree's benefit payments, the unit member shall pay<br/>to the District a service fee of $5.00 per month per program.</p>
<p>DOMESTIC PARTNER COVERAGE</p>
<p>18.50 Domestic Partner Coverage</p>
<p>Unit members' domestic partners and their dependents shall be eligible for<br/>medical benefits on the same terms as unit members' spouses and their<br/>dependents. Domestic partners of retirees are not covered unless the<br/>domestic partnership commenced prior to the retirement. The domestic<br/>partner benefit shall be available only to the extent that District medical plan<br/>providers agree to make it available. The District shall not be responsible to<br/>obtain additional medical insurance carriers solely for the purpose of offering<br/>domestic partner benefits. However, if a medical provider chooses not to<br/>offer domestic partner coverage or cancels such coverage, the District will<br/>work cooperatively with the Association to obtain a substitute provider who<br/>will offer the coverage. The provision of benefits to the domestic partners<br/>shall be on the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p>18.50.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domestic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall exist between two</p>
<p>persons regardless of their gender and each of them shall be the<br/>domestic partner of the other if both complete, sign and have<br/>notarized the Sonoma Valley Unified School District Domestic<br/>Partner Affidavit.</p>
<p>18.50.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria: A domestic partnership exists when all of the following</p>
<p>occur:</p>
<p>18.50.2.1 Both persons have a common residence.</p>
<p>18.50.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons share the common necessities of life<br/>and agree to be jointly responsible for each other's<br/>basic living expenses during the domestic<br/>partnership.</p>
<p>18.50.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither person is married nor a member of another<br/>domestic partnership.</p>
<p>18.50.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two (2) persons are not related by blood in a<br/>way that would prevent them from being married<br/>to each other in this state.</p>
<p>18.50.2.5 Both persons are at least eighteen (18) years of<br/>age and are mentally competent to consent to<br/>contract.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>18.50.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been at least twelve (12) months since<br/>either of the two parties has filed a statement of<br/>termination of a previous domestic partnership<br/>affidavit with the Sonoma Valley Unified School<br/>District.</p>
<p>18.50.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two (2) parties agree to notify the Sonoma<br/>Valley Unified School District Personnel Office if<br/>there is a change in the circumstances attested to<br/>in the affidavit or if the domestic partnership is<br/>terminated.</p>
<p>18.50.3 A domestic partnership shall terminate when any of the</p>
<p>following occurs:</p>
<p>18.50.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One partner gives or sends to the other partner a<br/>notarized written notice that he or she is<br/>terminating the partnership.</p>
<p>18.50.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the domestic partner dies.</p>
<p>18.50.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the domestic partner marries.</p>
<p>18.50.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic partners no longer have a common<br/>residence. A temporary separation resulting from<br/>work, education, or health-related requirements<br/>shall not constitute the cessation of a common<br/>residence.</p>
<p>18.50.4 Termination. Upon termination of the domestic partnership, the<br/>employee shall notify the District by filing a Certificate of<br/>Termination of Eligibility. The Certification shall include a<br/>statement whereby the employee shall certify under penalty of<br/>perjury that he or she notified his or her domestic partner of the<br/>termination of the partnership. All benefits provided by this<br/>Section shall cease as of the day of the month following receipt<br/>of the Certification of Termination of Eligibility. (See Appendix<br/>B-2).</p>
<p>The Certification must be filed within thirty (30) days of the end<br/>of the domestic partnership. If the District suffers any loss as a<br/>result of the employee's failure to file the Certification, the<br/>employee shall be liable to the District for actual loss<br/>engendered by the failure to receive notice that the domestic<br/>partnership has been terminated.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>18.50.5 Application and Terms: In order to receive any benefit provided<br/>for by this Section, an employee and his or her domestic partner<br/>shall complete, have notarized and file with the District a<br/>Sonoma Valley Unified Domestic Partner Affidavit. (See<br/>Appendix B-l).</p>
<p>The form shall also include a signed statement indicating that<br/>the employee agrees that he or she is required to reimburse the<br/>District for any expenditures made by the District for any<br/>administrative charges and other costs on behalf of the<br/>domestic partner if any of the submitted documentation is found<br/>to be incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent.</p>
<p>Employer-paid health care coverage for the domestic partner<br/>and dependents is considered taxable income to the employee<br/>unless the domestic partner is a dependent as that term is<br/>defined by Section 152(a) of the internal Revenue Code. This<br/>benefit coverage is subject to federal income tax and must be<br/>reported as imputed income on the employee's Form W-2. The<br/>district must pay OASDI, Medicare and any applicable taxes on<br/>these amounts and ensure adequate withholding.</p>
<p>The non-employee domestic partner does not have any rights to<br/>continuing coverage under federal law through COBRA or under<br/>any state law.</p>
<p>The District shall be indemnified by the employee against any<br/>legal action pursued by another party under community<br/>property, contract, or family laws.</p>

<p>7.8 1 In the event the evaluator determines that a unit member is not meeting the performance<br/>standards set forth in Section 7.2 it shall be the responsibility of the evaluator to so advise the<br/>unit member and to suggest reasonable methods where such deficiencies can be corrected.</p>
<p>7.8.2 An unsatisfactory rating shall not be given in any of the standards unless the evaluator finds<br/>practices not consistent with standards expectations in at least two (2) of the elements describing<br/>the standard. Unsatisfactory elements will be identified in the comments section of the<br/>appropriate standard in the summative evaluation.
