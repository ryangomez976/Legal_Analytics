<p>9.10.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VTA will notify the District in writing by May 1 of each year of the Association’s intent to<br/>utilize the release time as outlined in this section if the Association does not intend to use the<br/>release time as outlined in this section.</p>
<p>9.10.1.1 Upon completion of the term as the President, the VTA President shall return to the<br/>same or similar position at his or her previous school site.

Upon completion of his/her term of office,<br/>he/she shall return to that position.</p>
<p>9.10.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If release time is less than full-time, the VTA President will be allowed to leave campus for<br/>Association business during his/her conference period. However, all requests for parent<br/>conferences will take precedence over Association business.</p>
<p>9.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The VTA President or designee shall be authorized&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to grant up to a total of seventy-five (75) days of</p>
<p>release time each school year. Actual substitute cost &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incurred will be borne by the VTA.</p>
<p>9.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to five (5) days of released time, with substitute&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cost borne by the District, will be granted for the</p>
<p>purpose of the V.T.A. State Council representative or his/her alternate to attend called meetings. No<br/>expenses will be paid by the Board. Up to three (3) days may be used by any individual.</p>
<p>9.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall, provide the Association with one copy of public documents requested when filed.<br/>Those documents shall include the Annual SACS Budget Report, Unaudited Actuals Budget Report,<br/>Interim Budget Reports, CBEDS Report, Salary FTE Scattergram, and Annual Audit Report.

Reimbursement received by the District for that portion of the compensation, benefits, and<br/>expenses paid by the VTA will be transmitted to the VTA.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACADEMIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FREEDOM</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the policy of the District that all instruction shall be fair, accurate, objective, and appropriate to the<br/>District and applicable law. It is also the policy of the District that instruction be appropriate to the age<br/>and maturity of the student(s), and sensitive to the community needs and the needs and values of our<br/>diverse cultures and heritages. Academic freedom is essential to the fulfillment of this policy and the<br/>District acknowledges the fundamental need to protect unit members from any censorship or restraint<br/>which might interfere with the unit member’s obligation to pursue truth in performance of their teaching<br/>functions. Accordingly:</p>
<p>10.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may introduce lawful political, religious or otherwise controversial material,<br/>provided that said material is relevant to the course content and within the scope of the law.</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing teaching functions, unit members may express their opinions on all matters<br/>relevant to the course content, in an objective manner. A unit member, however, shall not<br/>utilize his/her positions to indoctrinate students with his/her own personal, political, and/or<br/>religious views.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may not be subject to unlawful discrimination or harassment regarding their personal<br/>opinions, their scholarly, literary or artistic endeavors, or their personal lifestyles.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No religious or political activities, or lack thereof, of any unit member shall be used for unlawful purposes<br/>of evaluation or disciplinary action.</p>
<p>10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member will make every effort to offer differing points of view. Each teacher shall promote an<br/>atmosphere in the classroom, which is conducive to free and open inquiry.</p>
<p>10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall adhere to the curriculum established by the District pursuant to applicable law.</p>
<p>10.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member files a complaint under this Article, the unit member has a right to VTA representation<br/>during the investigative process. VTA will be immediately notified when a unit member submits a<br/>complaint under this Article. Appropriate steps will be taken to protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11: PROFESSIONAL DUES OR FEES AND PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of the Association, or who has applied for membership, may sign<br/>and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of membership dues, initiation fees and<br/>general assessment in the Association. Such authorization shall continue in effect from year to year<br/>unless revoked in writing at any time. Pursuant to such authorization, the District shall deduct one-tenth<br/>(1/10) of such dues from the regular salary check of the unit member each month excluding July and<br/>August. Deductions for unit members who sign such authorizations after the commencement of the<br/>school year shall be appropriately prorated, commencing with the month of employment or month of<br/>beginning membership. The implementation of the twelve (12) pay option is subject to the capabilities<br/>of the San Diego County Department of Education.</p>
<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all membership dues or agency service fees deducted by the Board pursuant to this<br/>Article, the Board agrees to remit promptly such monies to the Association.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill the provisions of this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon appropriate written authorization from a unit member, the Board shall deduct from the salary of<br/>such unit member and make appropriate remittance for annuities, credit union, savings bonds,<br/>charitable donations, or any other plans or programs jointly approved by the Association and the Board.</p>
<p>11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those bargaining unit members who are on paid leave, including part-time employees, shall continue to<br/>pay dues to the Association if they have voluntary dues authorization cards on file.</p>
<p>11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members with payroll authorizations on file who are on unpaid leave of absence shall<br/>have said authorization continue in effect upon return to active duty unless appropriately canceled<br/>pursuant to this Article.</p>
<p>11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall deduct an agency service fee from the wages of all employees who have elected not to<br/>join the Association and who have not paid an agency service fee directly to the Association. The<br/>amount of the agency service fee must not exceed regular Association dues, and the agency service<br/>fee must not support Association activities beyond the Association's representational obligations.</p>
<p>11.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, any teacher who is a member of a religious body<br/>whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee<br/>organizations shall not be required to join, maintain membership in, or financially support any employee<br/>organization as a condition of employment; except that such employee is required, in lieu of payment of<br/>dues to the Association, to pay an amount equal to the current Association's dues to any non-religious,<br/>non-labor organization, charitable funds exempt from taxation under Section 501 (c) (3) of Title 26 of the<br/>Internal Revenue Code. Proof of payment to any fund shall be made on an annual basis to the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>11.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall indemnify and hold harmless the District from any claims, demands, or lawsuits<br/>arising out of or from the provisions of this Article, including the agency service fees provision. The<br/>District agrees to notify the Association in writing within thirty days after receipt of any written claims,<br/>demands, or lawsuits arising out of or from the provisions of this Article. Upon written request from the<br/>Association, the District will consult with the Association about the defense of any written claims,<br/>demands, or lawsuits. If a settlement offer is made by anyone filing a claim, demand, or lawsuit, and the<br/>Association requests that the District accept the settlement offer, the District shall accept the settlement<br/>offer if it does not adversely affect the District.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALARIES</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary schedules and salary classification requirements of all unit members are set in<br/>Appendixes A-2, A-3, A-4, and A-5.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members who serve other than the required number of days for their job classification shall<br/>receive salary which is not less than that which bears the same ratio to the established annual salary<br/>for their position as the number of days they serve bears to the number of working days required for<br/>job classification. This is specifically exclusive of summer school. Unit members who serve for one<br/>full school semester shall receive not less than one-half (1/2) the annual salary for their position.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual salaries, as set forth in this Agreement, shall be paid in twelve (12) equal installments.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be placed on the appropriate class of the salary schedule in accordance with the<br/>degrees and advanced preparation they have completed.</p>

Any bargaining unit members hired after-April 25, 2005-shall receive up to six (6) years of<br/>credit on the salary schedule for public school teaching experience outside the District but within the<br/>United States.</p>
<p>12.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties intend this provision to fall within the scope of Education Code Section 45028 (b).</p>
<p>12.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For placement on the salary schedule, a year must equal at least seventy five percent (75%)<br/>of the teaching days in one year. A day must equal at least seventy five percent (75%) of the<br/>classroom day.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quarter units are converted to semester units by multiplying the quarter units by two-thirds (2/3). If<br/>this multiplication results in a fraction that when added to the other semester units is within a<br/>half-semester unit from the required units for qualifying for the next column, then the fraction shall be<br/>rounded up to the next whole number and the unit member shall be placed on the next column (i.e.,</p>
<p>29.5 semester hours will be counted at 30 semester hours).</p>
<p>12.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All earned upper division or graduate credits from a properly accredited college or university may be<br/>used in horizontal movement on the salary schedule provided that the units are approved by the<br/>District and the work meets one of the following:</p>
<p>12.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course is designed to increase the unit member's knowledge and skill in his/her present<br/>or projected teaching assignment.</p>
<p>12.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course is part of the continuing education units designed to increase the knowledge and<br/>skill of unit member other than a classroom teacher and required for his/her present<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>12.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course is part of a program designed to allow the unit member to prepare a minor field of<br/>instruction or earn a full credential, an appropriate advanced degree, National Board<br/>Certification, or a credential for administration, supervision, or special services. An<br/>educational improvement plan must be submitted on the Course Approval form. The plan<br/>must be approved as potentially beneficial to the District.</p>
<p>12.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course is sponsored or recommended by the District. One (1) semester unit credit will<br/>be granted for every fifteen (15) hours of District in-service/workshops taken during the<br/>non-duty hours. The District is not obligated to pay any expense incurred. The</p>
<p>ii</p>
<p>course/workshop must be approved by the Deputy Superintendent, Curriculum and</p>
<p>Instruction.</p>

<p>12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper division or graduate work completed prior to the granting of the Baccalaureate Degree shall be<br/>credited in the same manner as work taken after the Baccalaureate Degree provided that the<br/>registrar of the college certifies on the official transcript that the requirements for the Bachelor’s<br/>Degree had been met prior to the start of such additional work.</p>
<p>12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time spent in excess of one year in the last step of Classes A, B, C, D and E will not accumulate for<br/>the purpose of making more than one (1) step change per year as an individual qualifies for a class<br/>advancement.</p>
<p>12.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary schedules and salary classification requirements of those serving in special assignments<br/>(extra duties) shall be paid in accordance with the schedules included in Appendix A-4 (Extra Duty<br/>Pay Schedule/Student Activities Assignments and Curriculum and Leadership Positions). If new<br/>stipend positions are proposed for inclusion in Appendix A-4, the District will immediately meet and<br/>negotiate.</p>
<p>12.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work percentage of a part-time certificated unit member is the ratio of the number of minutes in<br/>actual class assignment compared to the number of minutes in actual class assignment of a full-time<br/>unit member at that school. This work percentage will be used in computing salary from the proper<br/>placement on the schedule. Campus day, sick leave, and other benefits and responsibilities will also<br/>be calculated on the same ratio.</p>
<p>12.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member’s salary cannot be changed during the term of an existing contract between the Board<br/>and the unit member unless the tentative placement is in error, or there is a change of assignment,<br/>duties, and responsibilities, or a change in the basic salary schedule.</p>
<p>12.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be granted one increment for each year of teaching service in Vista until the<br/>maximum salary of the class is reached.

<p>12</p>
<p>12.18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of payment for extra duty assignments will be subject to the payment schedule</p>
<p>developed by the San Diego County Department of Education.</p>
<p>If more than one method of payment is available, the District and Association shall resume</p>
<p>negotiations to determine which method shall be made available to Vista employees.</p>
<p>12.19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Personnel Advisory Group (PAG) is composed of three unit members selected by the Vista</p>
<p>Teachers Association, and three administrators approved by the Superintendent, one of whom is the</p>
<p>Assistant Superintendent of Human Relations (and one member approved by the Superintendent).</p>
<p>The duties and responsibilities of the Personnel Advisory Group shall include:</p>

<p>12.20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members will be given first priority for all assignments designated to be for<br/>Special Education Extended Year assignments. The order of priority shall be site, district<br/>wide and then if needed, from outside the District. Teaching Special Education Extended<br/>Year is voluntary, not mandatory, for all teachers.</p>
<p>12.21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALARY SCHEDULE RAISES</p>
<p>12.21.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Salary Schedule (Appendix A-2) will be increased by 3.28% retroactive to January 1,<br/>2014, 6.26% effective January 1, 2015. All tentative agreements reached shall be valid only<br/>upon ratification of this Contract by both the Vista School District Board of Trustees and the<br/>membership vote of the Vista Teachers Association.</p>
<p>12.21.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Contract, when salaries and benefits are open for negotiations, the<br/>District and the Association agree to do so with the intent to increase salaries and/or benefits<br/>based on any addition to the base grant gap funding in the Local Control Funding Formula.<br/>The District and Association agree to meet and consult on the use of Supplemental and<br/>Concentration funds as they relate to the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). The<br/>parties agree to negotiate the impacts and effects of the LCAP in areas subject to bargaining.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13: UNIT MEMBER BENEFITS</p>
<p>13.1 The Board shall provide all eligible unit members and their dependents with health, dental, vision, and<br/>life insurance as described below.</p>
<p>13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult Ed/ROP</p>
<p>13.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult Ed/ROP teachers who are assigned by the District at least eighteen (18) hours per<br/>week will be eligible for a portion of the District contribution toward the health benefits<br/>described in this Article, prorated according to the percent of a full-time thirty-six (36) hour<br/>per week position.</p>
<p>13.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Adult Ed/ROP teacher may pay for the cost of benefits in excess of the District<br/>contribution by automatic payroll deduction. No Adult Ed/ROP teacher shall be eligible<br/>for more than one District contribution based on any combination of regular day school<br/>employment and Adult Ed/ROP employment. Any change in the District contribution<br/>resulting from a change in the Adult Ed/ROP teacher assignment will take effect on the<br/>first of the month next following the effective date of the change. An Adult Ed/ROP<br/>teacher may not combine hours assigned in regular day school employment and Adult<br/>Ed/ROP employment in order to qualify for a greater District contribution toward health<br/>benefits than the teacher would qualify for a regular day school employee alone.</p>
<p>13.1.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a teacher’s regular day school assignment and his/her Adult Ed/ROP<br/>assignment each equals at least fifty percent (50%) of the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE),<br/>as defined in this agreement for benefit purposes, then the teacher will qualify for one<br/>hundred percent (100%) of the District contribution. Examples, for illustration purposes<br/>only:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty percent (50%) of FTE assignment in regular day school program and thirty<br/>percent (30%) of FTE assignment in Adult Ed/ROP qualified for fifty percent<br/>(50%) District contribution.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty percent (30%) of FTE assignment in regular day school program and thirty<br/>percent (30%) of FTE assignment in Adult Ed/ROP qualifies for zero (0%)<br/>District contribution.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty percent (50%) of FTE assignment in regular day school program and fifty<br/>percent (50%) of FTE assignment in Adult Ed/ROP qualifies for one hundred<br/>percent (100%) District contribution</p>
<p>13.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-12 Employees</p>
<p>13.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the duration of this contract, the District will contribute a maximum, depending<br/>upon choice of plan, per full-time unit member for medical, dental, vision, and life<br/>insurance, $10,800 toward the purchase of benefits for bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>13.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will contribute a prorated share of the amount specified in 13.1.2.1 for<br/>all unit members working at least half-time but less than full-time if the part-time<br/>unit members elect to take the coverage and pays the balance of the actual cost.<br/>Eligible part-time unit members may elect to take medical coverage only.</p>
<p>13.1.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly (12-pay) amount the District will contribute a maximum, depending<br/>upon choice of plan per full-time unit member (part-time prorated) will be $900.00. <sup>14</sup></p>
<p>14</p>
<p>13.1.2.4 It is understood that the Benefit Plan Year for each full-time unit member (part-time<br/>prorated) will begin on October 1 or such other date as the District and VTA<br/>designate by written agreement and continue for a period of 12 months.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee-Employer Insurance Committee</p>
<p>13.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to participate in a collaborative partnership as a means of delivering<br/>benefits during the term of the agreement. The Insurance Committee will be a collaborative<br/>partnership, composed of equal representation from both VTA and management and will<br/>meet on a regular basis to make recommendations affecting the insurance program. The<br/>type and level of benefits (examples: medical conditions qualifying for coverage, deductibles,<br/>and co-pays under the package) will be modified only through the bargaining process.<br/>Members of this Committee will not be paid for their service but will receive four (4) event<br/>credits.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous Provisions, Duration of Benefits</p>
<p>13.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided in this Article covering Medical, Dental, Vision, and Life Insurance,<br/>shall be for the term of this contract. Dependent coverage for medical, dental, and vision will<br/>be extended for twelve (12) months after the death of a participating unit member. After<br/>twelve (12) months, the dependent may remain with the group plan for medical, dental, and<br/>vision at their own expense for the maximum term allowed by law for the District.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits During Leaves</p>
<p>13.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage shall continue during the period of a Board-approved paid leave of absence covering<br/>half-salary or more. If a unit member is on leave of absence without any pay status, he/she<br/>may convert the Medical, Dental and Vision Plan coverage for the duration of the approved<br/>leave made on a direct payment basis by forwarding to the District in advance, the monthly,<br/>semi-annual or annual rate for the coverage. Direct payment for benefit coverage shall begin<br/>upon the commencement of unpaid leave and end upon return to paid status. If the employee<br/>wants to continue Life Insurance coverage during the unpaid leave, it can be for a period of<br/>twelve months only at the employee’s expense.</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits Upon Separation from Employment</p>
<p>13.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a unit member separate from employment (except for retirement covered below in Article<br/>13.6), the unit member shall be entitled to continue coverage under the medical, dental, vision,<br/>and life plans through the last day of the month following the month during which the separation<br/>is effective. Employees who are on the “lay off list” (Reduction in Force employees) shall have<br/>their benefits continue through September 30th. The unit member shall then be entitled to<br/>COBRA benefits at their own expense as required by law.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits Upon Retirement</p>
<p>13.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any active member of the bargaining unit who retires from CalSTRS orCalPERS after January<br/>30, 2003 and has rendered at least ten (10) years of full-time service or its equivalent with the<br/>Vista Unified School District and who chooses to retire at age 55 or later, the District will<br/>contribute fifty percent (50%) annually towards the purchase of the District's insurance<br/>programs to age 65 and any Medicare, Medicare B, Medicare Supplement, or supplemental<br/>coverage provided by the agreed upon insurance program for members and/or their spouse<br/>until the retiree becomes 68 years of age or is deceased. The District contribution from age 65<br/>to age 68 for the supplemental coverage shall be the costs up to the same dollar amount<br/>contributed for the District insurance programs for the retiree. Any additional cost for the<br/>supplemental coverage shall be borne by the retiree. <sup>15</sup></p>
<p>15</p>
<p>13.6.2 However, an active member, currently enrolled in health benefits, who retires from CalSTRS or<br/>CalPERS may choose to opt for a cash-out program if he/she desires. (Until age 65)</p>
<p>Cash out payments would be as follows:</p>

</table>
<p>A pro-ration of the cash-out will be made which is dependent upon the exact age of the<br/>individual.</p>
<p>13.6.3 Any retiring individual may participate at his/her own cost in the District's medical plan or a<br/>combination of medical with dental and/or vision plans. Such former unit member shall pay<br/>the monthly premium in advance for continued coverage.</p>
<p>13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacement or Repairing Unit Member's Property</p>
<p>13.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will reimburse unit members for damaged, destroyed, or stolen personal property<br/>such as eye glasses, hearing aids, dentures, watches, electronic devices, articles of clothing<br/>necessarily worn or carried by the unit member, or vehicles when any such property is<br/>damaged in the line of duty without fault of the unit member if such property is stolen from<br/>the unit member by robbery or theft while the unit member is in the line of duty, only to the<br/>extent that a unit member's Homeowner's policy deductible will not cover the claim. A unit<br/>member's Homeowner's policy is to be considered the primary insurer, and the District will<br/>only reimburse the unit member up to the deductible amount of that unit member's policy (not<br/>to exceed $500). If the unit member does not have a Homeowner's policy, the District will<br/>not be liable for more than $500.</p>
<p>13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits Upon Disability</p>
<p>13.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the bargaining unit who has rendered at least ten (10) years of full-time<br/>service or its equivalent with the Vista Unified School District will receive the following<br/>disability benefits.</p>
<p>13.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While applying for disability leave, the employee will assume financial responsibility for<br/>maintaining the health benefits. However, once the employee is determined to be eligible for<br/>the disability allowance, the District will reimburse the employee up to $220 per month for a<br/>period of not more than 39 months, as outlined in Article 16.3.</p>
<p>13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRC Section 125 Benefits</p>
<p>13.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to provide unit members, through the mutually agreed upon program as<br/>provided by IRC Section 125.</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Benefit Waiver: Bargaining unit members who have coverage elsewhere may waive the health</p>
<p>benefits provided under Article 13. The unit member would still have $50,000 of life insurance to be</p>
<p>paid by the District. Supplemental life insurance will be paid by the employee.</p>
<p>13.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dual-Covered Spouse Option: Eligible, full time, dual-covered Vista Unified School District<br/>(VUSD) couples may change to a single covered plan where one spouse is covered as a<br/>dependent on the other spouse’s VUSD insurance plan. <sup>16</sup></p>
<p>16</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiving spouse would be covered as a dependent under the medical, dental, and<br/>vision.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiving spouse would have no dual coverage under medical, dental, and vision.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the enrolled spouse and the waiving spouse would still have $50,000 of life<br/>insurance each at a cost to be paid by the District. Supplemental life insurance costs<br/>will be paid by the employee.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no monthly payroll medical premium deduction for either spouse.</p>
<p>The District and VTA agree that 50% of the total amount of this savings will go toward the<br/>certificated and management fund balance. The final calculation of the total amount of savings<br/>distribution to the fund balance will be made by the District based on the number of eligible, full<br/>time, and dual-covered VUSD couples participating in the married couple option. When any<br/>eligible plan offering no longer results in a savings this married couple option will no longer be<br/>available. <sup>17</sup></p>
<p>17</p>
<p>A retirement incentive may be offered by the District periodically.</p>
<p>18</p>

<p>16.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each year of service, every full-time certificated employee shall be entitled to one day per<br/>month assigned, up to ten (10) days, for absence due to personal illness or injury with full pay<br/>whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of his/her employment. Permitted<br/>days of absence are exclusive of all days the employee is not required to render service to the<br/>District. If an employee does not take the full amount of leave allowed in any school year, the<br/>amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to year. A part-time employee on a regular<br/>basis is entitled to a prorated amount of sick leave, except as provided in 16.1.1.1 below.</p>
<p>16.1.1.1 Each Adult Ed/ROP certificated employee shall be entitled to one (1) hour for every<br/>eighteen (18) hours worked for absence due to personal illness or injury with full pay<br/>whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of his/her employment.<br/>Permitted days of absence are exclusive of all days the employee is not required to<br/>render service to the District. If an employee does not take the full amount of leave<br/>allowed in any school year, the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to<br/>year.</p>
<p>16.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee is absent due to illness or injury for a period of five (5) school months or less,<br/>and a substitute is employed, the amount deducted from the salary of the employee for any<br/>month in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum which is actually paid the<br/>substitute. If an employee is absent due to illness or injury, and a substitute is not employed,<br/>the employee shall receive whichever is greater of fifty percent (50%) of his/her regular salary or<br/>his/her regular salary less the established substitute rate during the absence for a period not to<br/>exceed five (5) school months.</p>
<p>The five (5) month period begins after the employee has used all full paid sick leave under<br/>Article 16.1. The employee shall not be provided more than (1) five (5) month period per illness<br/>or injury. If the use of differential sick leave occurs at a time when the full five (5) months will<br/>overlap into the next school year, the employee shall be entitled to only that amount of<br/>differential sick leave remaining at the end of the school year in which the illness or injury<br/>commenced.</p>
<p>When an employee has exhausted all available sick leave, including accumulated sick leave<br/>and differential sick leave and continues to be absent on account of illness or accident for a<br/>period beyond the five (5) month period, and the employee is not medically able to resume<br/>the duties of his or her position, the employee shall, if not placed in another position, be<br/>placed on a reemployment list for a period of 24 months if the employee is in probationary<br/>status, or for a period of 39 months if the employee is in permanent status. When the<br/>employee is medically able, during the 24 or 39 month period, the employee shall be returned<br/>to employment in a position for what he or she is credentialed and qualified. The 24 or 39<br/>month period shall commence at the expiration of the five (5) month period of differential sick<br/>leave.</p>
<p>16.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event an absence due to illness or injury is five (5) days or less, the employee may be<br/>required to sign a statement declaring that he/she was ill. If the illness is for a period exceeding<br/>five (5) days, a statement signed by a medical practitioner may be required. At any time, the<br/>Board of Trustees may, at the Board’s expense, require a statement from a medical practitioner<br/>designated by them to verify the individual was ill and not able to work.</p>
<p>16.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave benefits earned in other California public school districts may be transferred to or<br/>from Vista Unified School District as provided by law.</p>
<p>16.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall provide each teacher with a written statement of his/her accrued sick leave<br/>total. Such statement shall be provided no later than September 30 of each year.</p>
<p>16.2 Religious Leave.</p>
<p>16.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher shall be entitled to three (3) days of leave each school year to observe a religious<br/>holiday or holidays of his/her faith. Observance of a religious holiday or holidays may be<br/>claimed as personal necessity leave.</p>

Such leave shall not be used for child<br/>care, child rearing, or preparation for child bearing, but shall be limited to those disabilities as<br/>set forth above.</p>
<p>16.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of such disability leave, including the date on which the leave shall commence and<br/>the date on which the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the employee and the<br/>employee's physician; however, the District management may require a verification of the<br/>extent of disability through physical examination of the employee by a physician appointed by<br/>the District, and at the District's expense.</p>
<p>16.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are entitled to leave without pay or other benefits for disabilities because of<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom when sick leave has been exhausted.<br/>The date on which the employee shall resume duties shall be determined by the employee on<br/>leave and the employee's physician; however, the District management may require a<br/>verification of the extent of disability through a physical examination of the employee by a<br/>physician appointed by the District.</p>

<p>25</p>
<p>16.11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee on sabbatical leave shall enjoy the same health and welfare benefits as any<br/>other employee on full-time assignment.</p>
<p>16.11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All applications for sabbatical leaves must outline the proposed program, state prospective<br/>benefits to the District, and be submitted in accordance with procedures established by the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>16.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Leave</p>
<p>16.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having completed four (4) years of service, any certificated employee may, at the<br/>discretion of the Board, be granted a leave of absence without pay for not less than one<br/>semester nor more than one (1) year.</p>
<p>16.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall provide the Board with written notice by March 1<sup>st</sup> for a first semester or<br/>one year leave for the upcoming school year. For a second semester leave of the current<br/>school year, the employee shall provide written notice by September 15<sup>th</sup>. The employee<br/>shall provide the Board with written notice of his/her intention to return by November 1<sup>st</sup> for a<br/>first semester leave or by March 1 for a second semester or one year leave. Failure to notify<br/>the Board will be considered as notice that the teacher will not return and that the position is<br/>vacant. At least ten (10) days before the notice is due, the District shall remind the employee<br/>of this obligation by certified letter.</p>
<p>16.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a full-time general leave is extended by the Board for a second year, the person filling the<br/>vacancy shall be offered a probationary contract.

<p>16.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Office Leave.</p>
<p>16.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every certificated person who has permanent status and is elected to any public office<br/>requiring absence from District employment shall be granted a leave of absence without pay<br/>from his/her duties as an employee of the District.</p>
<p>16.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of such leave of absence, the employee may be employed by the District to<br/>perform such less-than-full-time service requiring certification qualifications for such<br/>compensation and upon such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon. Such<br/>absence shall not affect in any way the classification of such employee.</p>
<p>16.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within six (6) months after the term of office of such employee expires, he/she shall be<br/>entitled to return to a position in the District at the salary to which he/she would have been<br/>entitled had he/she not absented himself/herself from the service of the District under this<br/>section.</p>
<p>16.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid Days of Absence.</p>
<p>16.14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may, by mutual agreement with the District, be granted unpaid days of absence<br/>for any reason not allowed under any paid leave in this Article.</p>
<p>16.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Leave Act</p>
<p>16.15.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of this provision to be consistent with the federal Family Medical Leave Act of<br/>1993 (29 U.S.C. § 2601 etseg.) and the California Family Rights Act of 1991, as amended<br/>October 5, 1993 (Cal. Gov't Code § 12945.2). It shall be interpreted so that there will be no<br/>violation of state or federal law. <sup>26</sup></p>
<p>26</p>
<p>16.15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time certificated employees with more than twelve (12) months of continuous service with<br/>the District shall be granted an unpaid family care and medical leave for up to a total of twelve<br/>(12) work weeks in a school year pursuant to the requirements of this provision. Part-time<br/>certificated employees who have completed at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250)<br/>hours of service in the twelve (12) months preceding the leave shall be entitled to the same<br/>benefit.</p>
<p>For purposes of this provision, the term &quot;family care and medical leave&quot; means:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave for reason of the birth of a child of the employee, the placement of a child with an<br/>employee in connection with the adoption of the child or foster care of the child by the<br/>employee, within one year of such birth or placement;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave to care of the employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition; or</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave because of a serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee<br/>unable to perform the functions of his or her position, except for leave taken for disability<br/>on account of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions.</p>
<p>16.15.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this provision, the term &quot;child&quot; means a biological, adopted, foster child, a<br/>step-child, a legal ward, or a child of an employee standing iri loco parentis who is either<br/>under eighteen (18) years of age and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical<br/>disability.</p>
<p>For purposes of this provision, the term &quot;parent&quot; means biological, foster, adoptive parent, a<br/>step-parent or a legal guardian, or other person who stood in loco parentis to the employee<br/>when the employee was a child.</p>
<p>For purposes of this provision, the term &quot;serious health condition&quot; means an illness, injury,<br/>impairment, or physical or mental condition which involves either of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider.</p>
<p>For purposes of this provision, the term &quot;health care provider” means an individual<br/>holding either a physician's and surgeon's certificate issued pursuant to applicable law, or<br/>an osteopathic physician's and surgeon's certificate issued pursuant to applicable law, or<br/>an individual who has been determined by the United States Secretary of Labor to be<br/>capable of providing health care services under the Family and Medical Leave Act of<br/>1993.</p>
<p>16.15.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unpaid family care leave shall be treated as any other unpaid leave. During the unpaid<br/>family care leave an employee shall retain employee status with the District, and such leave<br/>shall not constitute a break in service. An employee returning from an unpaid family care<br/>leave shall have no less seniority than when the leave commenced.</p>
<p>16.15.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee learns of facts necessitating a family care and medical leave more than thirty<br/>(30) calendar days prior to the time the leave is needed, the employee shall provide written<br/>notice to the District immediately. A minimum of thirty (30) calendar days written notice is<br/>required.</p>
<p>16.15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee learns of facts necessitating the family and medical care leave less than thirty<br/>(30) calendar days prior to the time the leave is needed, the employee shall provide written<br/>notice to the District as soon as possible. The employee is required to provide the District<br/>with written notice within five (5) working days of learning of the need for the leave.</p>
<p>16.15.7</p>
<p>16.15.8</p>
<p>16.15.9</p>
<p>16.15.10</p>
<p>16.15.11</p>
<p>16.15.12</p>
<p>16.15.13</p>
<p>If the employee's need for the leave is foreseeable due to a planned medical treatment or<br/>planned supervision of the employee, or that of a child, parent, or spouse with a serious<br/>health condition, the employee shall consult with the District regarding the scheduling of the<br/>treatment or supervision so as to prevent undue disruption to the operations of the District.<br/>Any scheduling of treatment or supervision shall be subject to the approval of the health care<br/>provider of the individual with the serious health condition. In any event, thirty (30) calendar<br/>days written notice is required.</p>
<p>The District requires that an employee's request for a family care and medical leave be<br/>supported by a written certification issued by the health care provider of the individual family<br/>member requiring care.</p>
<p>16.15.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is requesting the leave to care for a child, parent, or spouse with a<br/>serious health condition, the certification shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the date on which the serious health condition commenced;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the probable duration of the condition;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an estimate of the time that the health care provider believes the employee<br/>needs to care for the individual requiring the care;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement that the serious health condition warrants the participation of the<br/>employee to provide care for the employee's child, parent, or spouse.</p>
<p>16.15.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is requesting the leave for his or her own serious medical<br/>condition, the certification shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the date on which the serious health condition commenced;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the probable duration of the condition;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a statement that, due to the serious health condition, the employee is unable to<br/>perform the function of his or her position.</p>
<p>If additional leave is requested beyond the period stated in the certification, the<br/>District may require the employee to obtain recertification in accordance with the<br/>procedures set forth above.</p>
<p>In any case in which the District has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided<br/>for the employee's own serious health condition, the District may require, at the District's<br/>expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a second health care provider, designated<br/>or approved by the District, concerning any information certified under Article 16.15.8.2.</p>
<p>In any case in which the second opinion described in Article 16.15.9 differs from the opinion in<br/>the original certification, the District may require, at the District's expense, that the employee<br/>obtain the opinion of a third health care provider, designated or approved jointly by the District<br/>and the employee. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered to be<br/>final and shall be binding on the District and the employee.</p>
<p>As a condition of an employee's return from leave taken because of the employee's own<br/>serious health condition, the employee shall obtain certification from his or her health care<br/>provider that the employee is able to resume work.</p>
<p>An eligible employee may elect, or the District may require the employee, to substitute<br/>accrued paid leave such as sick leave, differential pay sick leave, or any other paid leave for<br/>any part of the twelve (12) work week period.</p>
<p>Family care and medical leave taken because of the serious health condition of the employee<br/>or the employee's spouse, child or parent, may be taken intermittently or on a reduced<br/>schedule leave when medically necessary. Intermittent or reduced schedule leave shall not<br/>result in a reduction of the total amount of family care and medical leave to which the</p>
<p>employee is entitled pursuant to state and federal law. Leave taken because of the birth of a<br/>child or placement of a child with the employee, shall not be taken intermittently or on a<br/>reduced schedule leave unless expressly agreed to by the District and the employee.</p>
<p>16.15.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee requests intermittent leave, or a reduced schedule leave, the District may<br/>require the employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position. The<br/>alternative position must be one which the employee is qualified for, which has equivalent pay<br/>and benefits, and better accommodates the recurring periods of leave than the employee's<br/>regular position.</p>
<p>16.15.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any period an employee takes unpaid family care and medical leave the District shall<br/>maintain and pay for coverage for current health and welfare benefits for a maximum of<br/>twelve (12) work weeks. The District may recover the premium that it paid as required by this<br/>provision for maintaining coverage for the employee under the group health plan if both of the<br/>following conditions occur:</p>
<p>16.15.15.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee fails to return from leave after the period of leave to which the<br/>employee is entitled has expired.</p>
<p>16.15.15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee's failure to return from leave is for a reason other than the<br/>continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that entitles the<br/>employee to family care and medical leave or other circumstances beyond the<br/>control of the employee.</p>
<p>16.15.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both parents are employed by the District, the District shall not be required to grant leave in<br/>connection with the birth, adoption, or foster care of a child that would allow the parents family<br/>care and medical leave totaling more than twelve (12) work weeks within a school year.</p>
<p>16.15.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave taken under the pregnancy disability provision set forth at Article 16.16.6 runs<br/>concurrently with family care and medical leave under federal law, but not family and medical<br/>leave under California law. Consequently, an eligible employee may take a pregnancy<br/>disability leave of up to four (4) months and a family care and medical leave of up to twelve<br/>(12) work weeks, for a combination of four (4) months plus twelve (12) weeks (approximately<br/>seven (7) months).</p>
<p>16.15.18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave taken under the industrial accident or illness disability runs concurrently with family<br/>care and medical leave under both federal and state law. An eligible employee may take a<br/>combined industrial accident or illness and family care and medical leave for a maximum total<br/>of twelve (12) workweeks in a school year.</p>
<p>16.16 Donated Sick Leave</p>
<p>16.16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees may donate sick leave to a member of the bargaining unit who<br/>qualifies for leave due to an unforeseen event affecting the employee or the employee's<br/>families health, and the employee has exhausted all fully paid leaves of absence.</p>
<p>16.16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who chooses to donate sick leave may donate from his/her accrued sick leave.</p>
<p>16.16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this situation, sick leave donations shall be made in terms of days and shall be utilized in<br/>terms of days.</p>
<p>16.16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who would like to donate sick days to another employee should make a request<br/>to donate to the certificated personnel office.</p>
<p>16.16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations will be transferred to the recipient as needed in the order they are received by the<br/>certificated personnel office. Donated sick leave not used by the recipient shall be returned to<br/>the individual donors. <sup>29</sup></p>
<p>29</p>
<p>16.16.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipient of donated sick leave shall be required to exhaust sick leave as it is credited<br/>during the absence due to the unforeseen event.</p>
<p>16.16.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated sick leave used by the recipient shall not exceed one (1) year in length and any<br/>utilization shall run concurrently with the five month differential pay as outlined in Article</p>

It is the intent of this Article to identify what<br/>activities can be considered to satisfy the minimum daily requirements and thus define instructional<br/>activity.</p>
<p>18.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTUAL CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION: Actual classroom instruction is any regularly<br/>scheduled classroom activity under the direct supervision of a properly credentialed teacher<br/>employed by the school district. Pupils assigned to those classes must be properly enrolled and<br/>regularly scheduled, have attendance records kept, and have the potential of earning transcript<br/>credit and/or grades for the courses attempted. Students who fail course work do not disqualify<br/>the apportionment day credit claimed in their behalf.</p>
<p>18.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PASSING TIME, BREAKS, AND RECESS: Actual passing time is and has been allowed since<br/>1967 for those students changing instructors and/or courses up to ten minutes between classes<br/>of like programs. Passing time is not credited for home to school, school to home, or to or from<br/>other programs such as regional occupational or adult programs.</p>
<p>18.4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom activities that are scheduled as single, continuous sessions for one<br/>hundred fifty (150) minutes or longer may credit one break up to ten (10) minutes<br/>to satisfy the student and/or teacher needs normally accomplished in passing<br/>periods.</p>
<p>18.4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recesses for Kindergarten occurring during the instructional day are considered<br/>instructional activity, however, recesses in all of the other elementary grades using<br/>self- contained classroom scheduling are not considered instructional activities. <sup>39</sup></p>
<p>39</p>
<p>18.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study halls and homerooms may be considered instructional activity if such activity is under the<br/>direct supervision of a credentialed teacher and students are regularly assigned with their<br/>attendance kept and reported as part of their daily program schedule.</p>
<p>18.4.3.1 Optional participation by students or attendance in open unscheduled resource<br/>centers are not considered instructional activity time when computing the minimum<br/>day requirements.</p>
<p>18.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent contract study is authorized for regular K-12 programs pursuant to Education<br/>Code Sections 51745 and 51746. Subject to the regulations, the fulfilled contract student work<br/>that is submitted and evaluated to meet the credentialed teacher specifications is considered<br/>instructional activity providing the weekly student contracts at least meet the minimum day<br/>standards. The student time on task or the appointment time necessary for assignment and<br/>evaluation are not considered instructional activity in a direct sense. Teacher records must<br/>evidence the assignment and assessment process which constitutes educational activity.</p>
<p>18.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the regular high school program the work experience time on task has no bearing on<br/>instructional activity except that new provisions require one (1) hour per week of related<br/>classroom instruction or counseling as a qualifying element of a bona fide work experience<br/>program.</p>
<p>It is also understood that all other regulations and laws are observed to qualify as a State<br/>Department of Education approved program with school district supervision. However, the<br/>continuation education school students have a work experience time on task relationship. Work<br/>experience may qualify for up to ten (10) hours of the fifteen (15) required for continuation<br/>attendance. The general rule of thumb is judged on the issue that each five (5) units of work<br/>experience grade credit attempted requires a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) hours of<br/>employment within a semester. Therefore, the portion of all of the ten hours of instructional<br/>activity claimed within a week has a direct relationship to the time on task within the work<br/>experience program.</p>
<p>18.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities excluded from instructional time are:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fees or admission charges are paid by the students.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-curricular activity such as student clubs or other voluntary non-graded school<br/>extra-curricular activity.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROP or work experience time on task.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administratively assigned suspensions or expulsions.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nutritional activity</p>
<p>18.5 NON-TEACHING AND EXTRA CURRICULAR DUTIES</p>
<p>18.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>

Extra<br/>Curricular Duties means those duties that are enumerated in Appendix A-4.</p>
<p>18.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-teaching duties shall be without additional compensation if they are conducted during the<br/>regular campus day and are assigned according to the following procedure:</p>
<p>18.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor at each building site shall prepare a master list of all<br/>non-teaching duty assignments, the estimated time required to perform each duty,<br/>and the frequency with which the duty is to be performed.</p>
<p>18.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon this master list, the immediate supervisor at each building site shall<br/>prepare a proposed schedule of non-teaching duty assignments in which duty<br/>assignments are so scheduled and arranged as to be approximately equal for each<br/>member of the bargaining unit at a given building. The proposed schedule of<br/>approximately equal non-teaching duty assignments shall be posted or published in<br/>the faculty workroom.</p>
<p>18.5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit shall sign up for their fair share of non-teaching<br/>duties as listed on the schedule. A part-time teacher shall sign up for their pro¬<br/>rated share.</p>

<p>18.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared contract proposal from on-site/off-site teachers shall be submitted to the site<br/>administrator who will review the proposal with the applicants and accept or reject the proposal<br/>based on its educational merit. Teacher proposals not accepted will receive a written<br/>explanation by the administrator of the reason for rejection.</p>
<p>18.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to ten percent (10%) of the teaching positions at any elementary school site may be<br/>designated as shared assignments. Shared assignments shall be with pay prorated. A work<br/>schedule agreeable to the teachers and the on-site administrator shall be developed for any<br/>shared assignment.</p>
<p>18.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REGULAR TEACHER SUBSTITUTE COMPENSATION - In the event a substitute is not available, a<br/>regular teacher who upon the request of an administrator volunteers to serve may be used as a<br/>substitute during his/her conference period. If a teacher declines to substitute, the administrator will<br/>respect that decision. Elementary teachers who take extra students when a substitute is not available<br/>will equally divide the one-day compensation for a long-term substitute.</p>
<p>18.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher who serves the equivalent of a regular teaching day during the school year shall be<br/>entitled to take, without loss of pay or benefits, a professional growth day. Any professional<br/>growth day or time accumulated must be taken at times mutually agreed upon by administrator<br/>and teacher.</p>
<p>18.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher who serves any fraction of a regular teaching day during the school year, shall be<br/>paid at the prevailing hourly rate for that fraction of a day.</p>
<p>18.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher who has accumulated a professional growth day or time through Regular Teacher<br/>Substitute Compensation shall have the option of receiving monetary compensation. Such<br/>compensation will be reimbursed based upon the following formula:</p>
<p>Secondary: Teacher hourly rate x number of class periods supervised<br/>Elementary: Teacher hourly rate x number of hours supervised</p>
<p>18.10 ROOM SHARING - When a need arises for teachers to share classrooms a site plan will be developed</p>
<p>by the site administrator.</p>

<p>45</p>
<p>period of five (5) years. After five (5) years, the teachers' seniority will come<br/>back into effect and move back up the list. A teacher who instructs in more<br/>than one subject area who has taught an additional period for one year will<br/>move to the bottom of the seniority list in all subject areas for five (5) years.<br/>After five (5)years the teacher's seniority would come back into effect in<br/>each subject area the teacher is instructing in at that time.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of equal seniority, the choice will be made by lottery.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring of additional staff.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiating action to provide additional classroom space.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment of staff.</p>
<p>20.1.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a resolution has not been achieved within the time lines specified<br/>herein, Articles 20.1.6 and 20.1.7 take the place of Levels I and II of the grievance process<br/>and the Association may file a grievance at Level III.</p>

<p>27.6.1 The parties acknowledge that such probationary employees may be dismissed or suspended<br/>without pay for a specified period of time in excess of fifteen (15) work days under Education<br/>Code Section 44948.3. Among the reasons that may be deemed sufficient by the District to<br/>dismiss or suspend without pay such probationary employees for a specified period of time in<br/>excess of fifteen (15) workdays are:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory performance determined pursuant to the (Article 11, Education Code<br/>Sections 44660, et seq.); or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause pursuant to Education Code Section 44932.</p>
<p>27.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Superintendent or designee shall give thirty (30) days' prior written notice of<br/>dismissal not later than March 15 in the case of second-year probationary employees. Notice of<br/>suspension without pay shall be given pursuant to Article 27.3. The notice shall include a<br/>statement of the reasons for the dismissal or suspension and notice of the opportunity to<br/>appeal. In the event of a dismissal or suspension for unsatisfactory performance, a copy of the<br/>evaluation conducted pursuant to Education Code Section 44664 shall accompany the written<br/>notice.</p>
<p>27.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the notice of dismissal or suspension is given, the employee shall have fifteen (15) days from<br/>receipt of the notice of dismissal or suspension to submit to the Board of Trustees a written<br/>request for a hearing. The failure of an employee to request a hearing within fifteen (15) days<br/>from receipt of a dismissal or suspension notice shall constitute a waiver of the right to a<br/>hearing. The hearing provided for in Article 27.4 shall constitute the hearing on the dismissal or<br/>suspension. However, the arbitrator's decision shall constitute a recommendation to the Board<br/>of Trustees and shall be advisory only.</p>

The information for<br/>setting up the District email accounts on Mobile Devices is located on the District's web site at<br/><a href="http://www.vistausd.ora/informationtechnoloav">www.vistausd.ora/informationtechnoloav</a>. The District will allow limited personal use. The<br/>establishment of a working District email address is the responsibility of the Employee working<br/>through his/her own Information Technology staff. Personal email accounts may be used on<br/>District Mobile Devices for convenience; but the primary use is for business.</p>
<p>Mobile Device Support or Assistance</p>
<p>The District cannot provide Information Technology support or assistance for the Mobile Devices;<br/>therefore, all Employees who wish to purchase a Mobile Device through the District will, using<br/>site/department funds, purchase a District-approved support contract for Mobile Device service<br/>and repair. The support contract may not cover the loss or misplacement of a Mobile Device.</p>
<p>Damage or Loss to Equipment</p>
<p>All Employees are to exercise due care when using Mobile Devices. Employees will be<br/>responsible for ensuring, to the extent practical, reasonable, and possible, that no loss, theft, or<br/>damage occurs to the Mobile Devices in their care, custody, or control. In the event of<br/>negligence (failure to use reasonable care), the Employee will be responsible for reimbursing the<br/>District for the Mobile Device at its current replacement value, or for replacing the Mobile<br/>Device with a current or comparable model.</p>

<p>Computer Law and Computer Crime</p>
<p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act have been<br/>enacted to control abuses of computers and electronic communication/data transmission. In<br/>California, Section 502 of the Penal Code prohibits tampering, interference, damage, and<br/>unauthorized access to lawfully-created computer data and computer systems. Penal Code<br/>Section 502 includes criminal penalties for introducing contaminants into computer systems and<br/>networks, allows the court to seize hardware and software used in the commission of a<br/>computer crime, and allows the courts to consider prohibiting persons convicted of computer<br/>crimes from having access to computers.</p>
<p>Use of Software Applications</p>
<p>Many of the Mobile Devices allow software to be downloaded as applications. The District will<br/>identify key applications to be used for business/classroom purposes to improve efficiency and<br/>productivity in daily functions. A unique user ID email address will be utilized for Employees to<br/>download the District approved key applications. Employees will be required fo use<br/>site/department funds to pay for the licensing of these key applications. The key applications<br/>will remain property of the District.</p>
<p>The use of an Employee's personal unique ID may be allowed on District owned Mobile Devices<br/>with the understanding that the District is not responsible for any damage. All applications<br/>purchased by the Employee using their personal unique ID shall remain with the Employee and<br/>will not be reimbursed by the District. Applications used must not violate conditions outlined in<br/>the Unacceptable Use section.</p>
<p>The undersigned, hereby accepts the Mobile Device identified below and agrees to comply<br/>with and abide by the Guidelines for Use as stated in this document. This document may later<br/>be amended and undersigned will receive notice of the amended document, at which time<br/>undersigned may sign the amended document or terminate the use of the District Mobile<br/>Device.</p>

<p>Dr. Devin Vodicka</p>
<p>July 9, 2014</p>
<p>Dear Esteemed Teachers,</p>
<p>This joint communication is the result of collaboration between VUSD and VTA and the intent is<br/>to clarify protocols in support of a service delivery model called, “Co-Teaching” or &quot;Supportive<br/>Teaching.” We are dedicated to providing our teachers with input and training so that this model<br/>may be implemented in an informed and meaningful way to best benefit our students. Should<br/>you have any questions about these protocols, please feel free to contact us.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the co-teaching/supportive teaching model, the following aspects must be<br/>followed:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administration with input from teachers facilitates the “pairings” of the education<br/>specialist and the general education teacher.</p>
<p>o Teacher participation in the co-teaching/supportive teaching model is voluntary.<br/>The administrator will respect a teacher’s decision not to participate in the<br/>co-teach model.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No less that 5 full days of professional development will be offered to volunteers (through<br/>houdy pay or release time) participating in co-teaching/supportive teaching. Topics will<br/>include:</p>
<p>o Philosophy of education<br/>o Behavior management<br/>o Grading</p>
<p>o Which type of co-teaching/supported teaching will be implemented<br/>o Classroom arrangement<br/>o Materials<br/>o Time management<br/>o Communication style</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, on-going professional development will occur throughout the year.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide common planning/prep period, secondary level, for the collaborative teams</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No co-taught general education setting shall exceed more than 33% of the enrollment of<br/>total students whose IEP indicates Specialized Academic Instruction</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-taught class sizes shall not exceed the contractual language specified in Article 20</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Devin Vodicka, Ed.D.<br/>Superintendent</p>
<p>VTA President</p>
<p>( lie purpose of the Vista Unified School District is to* inspire each and every student to<br/>persevere as critical thinking individuals who^^ajlaborate to solve real world problems.</p>
