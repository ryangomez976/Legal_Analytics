<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievant is one or more teachers making the claim.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Party in Interest is any person who might be required to take action, or against<br/>whom action might be taken, in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate Supervisor is the principal or supervisor having immediate jurisdiction<br/>over the employee filing the grievance and who has authority to resolve the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative<br/>level, equitable solutions to claims that there have been violations or<br/>misinterpretations of a provision of the Agreement. Both parties agree that these<br/>proceedings will be kept informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any<br/>level of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time<br/>specified at each level should be considered to be maximums, and every effort<br/>should be made to expedite the process as soon as practical. The time limits may,<br/>however, be extended by mutual agreement. Time limits provided in Levels Two,<br/>Three, and Four shall begin the day following receipt by personal delivery or<br/>certified mail of written decisions by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure for Individual Grievance</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One - Informal Resolution</p>
<p>The grievant shall first discuss the grievance with his/her immediate supervisor<br/>within ten (10) working days of when he/she knew of the circumstances which<br/>form the basis for the grievance. Both parties shall seek to resolve the matter<br/>informally. Beginning with Level One, the grievant and the administrators shall<br/>have the right to be accompanied by a representative of their choice. If a grievant<br/>is not represented by the ASSOCIATION, the DISTRICT shall simultaneously<br/>provide a copy of the decisions beyond Level One to the ASSOCIATION<br/>President.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two - Formal Resolution</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at Level<br/>One or if no decision has been rendered within ten (10) working days after<br/>discussion of the grievance, he /she may file a written grievance with his/her</p>
<p>immediate supervisor on a form provided by the DISTRICT. (See Appendix “D”)<br/>The grievant will submit a copy of the written grievance to the ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>President.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) working days after receipt of a written grievance, the immediate<br/>supervisor will meet with the grievant in an effort to resolve the grievance. The<br/>immediate supervisor shall submit his/her written decision to the grievant within<br/>ten (10) working days after the meeting.</p>
<p>3. Level Three</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level Two or if no decision is<br/>rendered within ten (10) working days, the grievant may appeal the decision in<br/>writing (see Appendix “E”), to the Superintendent or designee within ten (10)<br/>working days. The Superintendent will meet with the grievant and/or his /her<br/>representative if requested by the grievant or the Superintendent before making a<br/>decision. The Superintendent shall provide a written decision, including the<br/>reason therefore, within ten (10) working days of the appeal. If a meeting is<br/>requested, the timeline shall be extended by five (5) working days.</p>
<p>4. Level Four</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at Level<br/>Three or if no written decision has been rendered within the Level Three<br/>timelines, the ASSOCIATION may, request the services of a mediator. This<br/>request shall be made within forty-five (45) days of denial or the Level Three<br/>response deadline. The request shall be in writing and made to the State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service with simultaneous notice to the<br/>Superintendent/designee. Mediation shall occur on dates and times that are<br/>mutually agreed to by the parties.</p>
<p>5. Level Five</p>
<p>If an acceptable mediated settlement is not reached between the parties at Level<br/>Four, the ASSOCIATION may, within ten (10) working days of when the parties<br/>determined to discontinue mediation efforts and with notice to the Superintendent,<br/>submit the grievance to Arbitration.</p>
<p>The parties shall attempt to select a mutually acceptable arbitrator. Should they<br/>be unable to agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) working days of the<br/>Association’s notice to the Superintendent that it intends to submit the grievance<br/>to arbitration, submission of the grievance shall be made to the American<br/>Arbitration Association. In either event, the parties shall be bound by the rules<br/>and procedures of the American Arbitration Association in the selection of an<br/>arbitrator and the arbitrator shall proceed under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration<br/>Rules of AAA.</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to, per diem,<br/>expenses, his/her travel and subsistence expenses, the cost of the any hearing<br/>room, the cost of the court reporter if requested by the Arbitrator, will be borne</p>
<p>equally by the DISTRICT and the ASSOCIATION. All other costs will be borne<br/>by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding on both parties.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure for Group/Association Grievance</p>
<p>If, in the judgment of the ASSOCIATION, a grievance affects a group or class of<br/>teachers, the ASSOCIATION may initiate and submit such grievance in writing to the<br/>Superintendent directly and the processing of such grievance will be commenced at Level<br/>Three. The ASSOCIATION may process such grievance even though there is no<br/>individual aggrieved person who wished to do so. (See sample grievance form under<br/>Appendix “E”).</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time without loss of pay to attend a grievance meeting or hearing shall be<br/>provided to all grievant, grievance representatives and witnesses involved in the<br/>grievance. Any employee whose appearance is necessary in such investigations<br/>may be released. These activities will be held on school days, after school hours,<br/>or whenever possible. In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it<br/>cannot be processed through all the steps in the grievance procedure by the end of<br/>the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school<br/>year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein<br/>may be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the<br/>school year or as soon as practicable. In the event a grievance is submitted fifteen<br/>(15) or fewer days before a vacation and a decision is not reached before said<br/>vacation, then the aggrieved person shall state his/her preference in writing,<br/>whether the grievance will be continued through vacation or delayed until after<br/>vacation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the<br/>personnel file of any of the participants.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents, will be provided by the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authority</p>
<p>The Arbitrator shall have no power to add to, to subtract from, or to change any of the<br/>terms or provisions of the Agreement. Jurisdiction shall extend solely to claims of<br/>violations of specific written provisions of the Agreement and involve only the<br/>interpretation and application of the Agreement.</p>

<p>Article VIII<br/>Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>A. Philosophy of Evaluation</p>
<p>It is the philosophy of the District that the principal purpose of evaluation should be to<br/>contribute to the professional growth and development of the employees of the District.<br/>It is understood that while the instruments of evaluation have the intent of being<br/>objective, the process of evaluation in itself is frequently a highly subjective process.<br/>Individuals involved in the implementation of the District’s evaluation program are<br/>exchanging perceptions and personal points of view, and hence, should approach their<br/>task with empathy and an understanding of the imperfection of any and all human<br/>endeavors. Evaluation procedures affected on these premises can, hopefully, be used<br/>successfully for the improvement of instruction and to encourage individual self-growth<br/>and development in the performance of assignments.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of Evaluation</p>
<p>The District’s evaluation procedures have the following purpose:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To comply with the requirements of state law.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To upgrade the quality of instructional services provided the students of the<br/>school district.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify and recognize outstanding professional performance of individual<br/>staff members.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify areas of weakness in the performance of district staff members so that<br/>proper procedures of assistance can be designed to help such personnel to become<br/>more effective and efficient in the performance of their assigned duties.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify conditions that exist in the district under which individuals serve that<br/>handicap the effectiveness of their deliverance of their instructional services.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of employees will be conducted by the Superintendent, Principal and /or the<br/>Assistant Principal.</p>
<p>D. The District shall evaluate and assess employee competency as it reasonably relates to the</p>
<p>following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of pupils toward the District’s standards of expected pupil<br/>achievement at each grade level in each area of study.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s adherence to curricular objectives.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment within the<br/>scope of the employee’s responsibilities.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional evaluation and assessment guidelines or criteria related to an<br/>employee’s assignment, job description, adjunct duties or job responsibilities.</p>
<p>E.</p>
<p>Teacher Evaluation Process</p>
<p>Evaluations will be conducted on an ongoing basis and will occur at least once each<br/>school year for probationary employees and at least every other year for permanent<br/>employees. Unit members with permanent status who have been employed consistently<br/>(5 consecutive years or more) with the Wheatland Union High School District, are highly<br/>qualified, as defined in 20U.C.S. Sec. 7801 (ESEA), and whose previous evaluation rated<br/>the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, shall be evaluated every three (3) to five<br/>(5) years if the unit member and evaluator mutually consent to this schedule, and there<br/>are no other professional concerns. Should the evaluator withdraw consent, notice and<br/>identifiable cause shall be provided to the unit member in a timely manner.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any permanent certificated employee has received an unsatisfactory evaluation, the<br/>District shall annually evaluate the employee until the employee achieves a positive<br/>evaluation or is separated from the District.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee being evaluated will submit a statement to the Superintendent, Principal<br/>or Assistant Principal proposing goals and objectives for a unit of study, techniques for<br/>the assessment of pupil achievement, and instructional techniques and strategies to be<br/>used by the employee. These items shall be mutually agreed upon and shall be within the<br/>Board’s adopted goals and objectives for courses.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During an evaluation, one (1) or more classroom observations will occur, at least one of<br/>which will be announced and mutually agreed to in advance regarding time, period and<br/>course of study. Other procedures to be used in evaluation may include, but not limited<br/>to, review of student performance data, judgment of the evaluator, or mutually acceptable<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation report, written by the evaluator, will be given to the evaluee. This report<br/>will be reviewed in an evaluation conference within ten (10) work days of the classroom<br/>observation.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of an unsatisfactory evaluation:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall, upon request, be entitled to at least one (1) additional<br/>observation and conference.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As appropriate, the evaluator shall take positive action to assist the employee in<br/>correcting cited deficiencies.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such action shall include, as appropriate, specific recommendations for<br/>improvement, direct assistance in implementing such recommendations, and<br/>release time for the employee to implement and utilize the resources made<br/>available within budgetary limits.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evaluation document will be placed in an employee’s file until it has been given to the<br/>evaluee. Within ten (10) work days of receipt of such a document, the evaluee may</p>
<p>submit a written response to be attached to the evaluation document.</p>
<p>Article IX<br/>Safety</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize a mutual responsibility for the safety of employees while they are<br/>on and in District facilities.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the District nor employees will knowingly violate the provisions of the California<br/>Occupational Health Standards Act (CAL-OSHA).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees are responsible for maintaining safe conditions in their work areas.<br/>Employees will report in writing any practice or condition which may be a threat to the<br/>safety of any person associated with the District to their immediate supervisor.</p>

Selection of the teacher shall come from the<br/>application list. If a teacher has a five period assignment, he/she will be required to<br/>remain on campus only six consecutive periods, except by mutual consent.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may occasionally be assigned to cover classes for another teacher.<br/>These will be made equitably and will not exceed three (3) in a school year. If it<br/>is necessary to assign a teacher to cover more than three (3) times, the teacher will<br/>earn personal necessity leave that may be taken at their discretion under the<br/>general guidelines of Section XU Teachers may use the earned time in period per<br/>period increments, and this shall not be charged to sick leave. Accumulated time<br/>is encouraged to be used within the year earned or must be used within the first<br/>semester of the following year. If accumulated time is not taken, the teacher will<br/>be paid at the hourly rate of the base salary.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the addition of an optional period to the schedule, some teachers will<br/>have completed their regular teaching day while others are still teaching. By<br/>mutual consent of the teacher and the administration, a teacher who has<br/>completed his/her workday could be hired as a one-period substitute. The rate of<br/>pay for this will be the hourly rate of the base salary.</p>

The person on leave is entitled to benefits given to other<br/>employees.</p>

<p>Reduced Workload</p>
<p>When a teacher who is employed full-time wishes to teach less than a full (5 period)<br/>assignment, the following procedures will be observed:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 1 the employee requests a leave of absence for the portion of the work<br/>load that is reduced. The specific nature (number of periods reduced) will be<br/>spelled out in the request. This leave will not extend beyond one school year. At<br/>the end of the school year for which the leave was granted, the teacher will<br/>automatically return to full-time status. Should the teacher wish to continue in a<br/>reduced work load status, a request should be submitted by March 1 as described<br/>above.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary and benefits will be granted at the rate of 20% of the individual’s salary for<br/>each period taught per year. Sick leave will be accrued in an amount that is pro¬<br/>rated to reflect the reduced contract work year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will receive credit for longevity increments and for service year<br/>advancement on the salary schedule only if the employee serves at least 75% of<br/>the time required for full-time (5 period) teaching assignment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation time is to be spent on campus at least in the same ratio as the reduced<br/>assignment is to a full-time (5 period) teaching assignment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers teaching less than a full day (within reason) are expected to attend in¬<br/>services, faculty meetings, parent conferences and other events required of full¬<br/>time teachers. Should the specific circumstances of a leave consistently prohibit<br/>such attendance, this will be indicated in the leave request.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While such leave may be applied for and granted at any time prior to the opening<br/>of school, the teacher will enhance the likelihood of being granted such leave by<br/>applying prior to March 1 of the previous school year.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once granted by the Board, such leaves may not be revoked by either the teacher<br/>or Board unless done by mutual consent.</p>

<p>It shall be the policy of the district to permit certificated employees of the District to<br/>reduce their workload from full-time to part-time and have their retirement benefits based<br/>on full-time employment.</p>
<p>To qualify for this program, the employee shall have the following:</p>
<table border="1">

An employee may request termination of the agreement. Such<br/>request shall be made in writing to the District not later than November 15 or<br/>March 15 in any school year, and the District shall act on the request on or before<br/>January 15 or May 15. If consent is given, the employee shall be reassigned to<br/>the school of previous full-time employment, or if such assignment cannot be<br/>made, the employee shall be given priority consideration for any vacancy for<br/>which he/she is qualified.</p>
