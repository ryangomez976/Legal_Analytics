<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on sabbatical leave will receive one-half of the salary they would have been<br/>paid during the period of leave, and the appropriate salary schedule placement, which<br/>would have been granted had the teacher not been on leave. No other compensation,<br/>benefit, or seniority credit will be granted to those on leave, except that the teacher<br/>will be entitled to return to a position comparable to that which was held at the time of<br/>granting of leave.</p>

In the case of a medically related leave the District<br/>may require a physician selected by the teacher from a list of three physicians<br/>designated by the District.</p>
<p>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE<br/>Statement of Intent</p>
<p>The purpose of the Catastrophic Sick Leave Donation (CSLDP) program is to provide<br/>paid sick leave in cases of incapacitating personal illness or personal injury of the<br/>employee or an immediate family member. Catastrophic Leave grants may ONLY be<br/>used after all accumulated paid leave has been used. The definition of sick leave shall be:<br/>leave that is granted to a member who through personal illness, injury or quarantine is<br/>unable to perform the duties of his / her position. This policy does not cover cosmetic or<br/>elective surgery.</p>
<p>In no case will granting of Catastrophic Sick Leave cause an employee to receive more<br/>than his / her annual base salary.</p>
<p>It is the philosophy of the administration to encourage employees to return to work as<br/>soon as the doctor approves and releases the employee to do so. Individuals who are on a<br/>grant of CSLDP, and whose doctor indicates they may return to work half time, may<br/>continue to receive approved grant days in half day increments.</p>
<p>No employee shall be considered eligible for compensation through the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Donation Program unless such employee was on duty or authorized absence<br/>including recess, holiday, or personal days on the duty day preceding the commencement<br/>of the disabling illness or injury.</p>
<p>In no event will a member receive more than a total of 100 consecutive days of CSLDP<br/>for any single catastrophic event.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>If an employee does not use all of the days collected through pledges, the unused sick</p>
<p>leave pledges will be divided by the number of donors and split evenly between all.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a certificated staff member experiences a catastrophic illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate them for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates a<br/>member of their immediate family which requires them to take time off from work for<br/>an extended period of time to care for that family member, and taking extended time<br/>off work creates a financial hardship for the member because he or she has exhausted<br/>all of their sick leave and other paid time off, including any temporary disability<br/>benefits, if applicable;</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff member may then complete a CSLDP Request Form and submit it to the<br/>Superintendent along with doctor verification of the nature of the catastrophic injury<br/>or illness. This request form will include a summary statement of the employee or<br/>employee’s family member’s situation that may be published to request donations in<br/>the event the request is approved;</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Committee consisting of two (2) McSwain Teachers<br/>Association elected officers and one (1) District Office representative unanimously<br/>determines that the employee has met the intent of this article relative to illness or<br/>injury that will necessitate their extended absence from work, and that the extended<br/>absence from work will create a financial hardship;</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon certification of the Catastrophic Leave Committee the Superintendent’s<br/>secretary will publish a notification and request for sick leave donations. This<br/>notification will include a due date. Fellow certificated employees that would like to<br/>contribute sick days may do so by completing the CSLDP Donation Form;</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated individuals choosing to donate must donate one full day minimum (7.5<br/>hrs) and then additional time may be donated in half day (3.75) increments to a<br/>maximum of 5 days (37.5 hours) per school year; (7.5, 11.25, 15,18.75, 22.5 .. . 37.5)</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated individuals who choose to donate may in no case take their personal sick<br/>day holding below 30 days (approximately 6 weeks);</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All donations of sick time will be held in strict confidence;</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the catastrophic leave if all of the days pledged have not been<br/>used, the additional days pledged will be divided by the number of donors and<br/>returned to their individual account.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Committee</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Leave Committee will review requests for donation of eligible leave<br/>benefits for a certificated employee’s catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>The Committee may request a variety of information to verify the catastrophic injury or<br/>illness of the employee or the employee’s immediate family member, including but not<br/>limited too:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diagnosis and / or prognosis from the member’s or family member’s treating<br/>physician.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated length of time the employee will be unable to work due to the catastrophic<br/>illness or injury.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If catastrophic leave request involves that of a family member, a justification of why<br/>the employee is the only person available to care for that family member.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other resources that might be available to help relieve the hardship.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the possibility of the employee’s eligibility for disability retirement benefits if<br/>the employee’s disability is likely to become permanent.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of other disability benefits that may be available for catastrophic injury or<br/>illness for the employee’s family member.</p>
<p>If the Catastrophic Leave Committee determines the employee is unable to work due to<br/>the member’s catastrophic illness / injury, and all eligibility criteria are met, the request<br/>to receive eligible leave credit will be approved. Otherwise, the Committee will indicate<br/>the basis of denial of the request.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Distribution of Eligible Leave Benefits</p>
<p>The Superintendent or his designee shall account for and distribute donated sick leave.<br/>Only authorized donated sick leave days used by recipient will be transferred to recipient.<br/>Donated sick leave days not used will not be transferred but will be returned in an<br/>appropriate pro-rata share to the donors. No unused sick leave days will be left in an<br/>account.</p>
<p>Crossing School Calendar Years</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave is tied to the catastrophic event and not the school calendar. In the<br/>event an approved Catastrophic Leave spreads across two calendar years please be<br/>advised of the following unique situation that will occur automatically with the support of<br/>the HR department. Approved ongoing Catastrophic Leave will automatically be placed<br/>on hold while the employee takes advantage of new sick leave earned at the start of the<br/>new school year. Once that leave is exhausted without further action on the part of the<br/>employee or the Catastrophic Leave Committee the remaining unused portion of the<br/>previously approved Catastrophic Leave will commence until such time as the employee<br/>is eligible to return or the approved leave is exhausted.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A party in interest is any person who might be required to take action or against whom<br/>action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to attempt to secure equitable solutions to grievances<br/>at the lowest possible administrative level. Both parties agree that these proceeding<br/>will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limit<br/>specified at each level shall be considered to be maximums and every effort should be<br/>made to expedite the process. The time limits may be extended, however, by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all<br/>the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school year and if left<br/>unresolved until the beginning of the following school year could result in harm to an<br/>aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein may be reduced so that the procedure<br/>may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon as it is practicable.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>A. An aggrieved person shall seek a solution(s) to the problem(s) through at least the<br/>informal discussion with the immediate supervisor prior to initiating a formalized<br/>grievance proceeding hereinafter described. Adjustment of a grievance through such<br/>an informal discussion may be accomplished without the intervention of the<br/>association. However, the aggrieved person may, at the person’s discretion, be<br/>represented by the Association in any such informal discussions.</p>
<p>Formal Procedure</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the administration to adhere to the decision deadline constitutes the right<br/>for the grievant to appeal automatically to the next step (higher level). Nothing<br/>prevents the parties from extending the dates by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I - The grievant will first present the grievance to the Superintendent either<br/>directly with or without the Association’s designated grievance representative within<br/>forty (40) days of the date of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance or the<br/>date the grievant became aware of the situation.

Each party shall<br/>alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The remaining panel member<br/>shall be the arbitrator. The order of striking shall be determined by lot. The arbitrator<br/>shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the issue or issues<br/>that were submitted to arbitration. If the parties cannot agree upon a summary of the<br/>issue, the arbitrator shall determine the issue(s) by referring to the written grievance<br/>and the answers thereto at each level. After a hearing and after both parties have had<br/>an opportunity to make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit within thirty<br/>(30) days to all parties, the written findings and decision. This decision will be final<br/>and binding on the parties. The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract<br/>from, or modify the terms of this agreement, nor does the arbitrator have power or<br/>authority to make any decisions which require the commission of an act prohibited by<br/>law or which is violative of the terms of this Agreement, or which falls within the<br/>jurisdiction of a state or federal agency which has authority to decide the issue in<br/>question.</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and a hearing shall be borne equally by the<br/>District and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring<br/>them.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>A. The filing of a grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the Board to<br/>proceed in carrying out its management responsibilities, subject to the final decision<br/>of the grievance. In the event the alleged grievance involves an order, requirement or<br/>other directive, the grievant shall fulfill or carry out such requirement or other<br/>directive pending the final decision of the grievance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may be self-represented at all levels of the grievance procedure or, as an<br/>option, by a representative selected by the Association.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and district Superintendent shall have the right to include in the grievance<br/>hearings such witnesses, as they deem necessary to develop facts pertinent to the<br/>grievance. These names shall be made available to both parties upon request. The<br/>costs of witnesses shall be borne by the party calling them.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative personnel shall not be required to consider more than one grievance<br/>claim per day, unless it is a class action.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at all levels of the formal grievance procedure will be in writing,<br/>setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore and will be transmitted promptly to<br/>all parties in interest and to the president of the Association. Time limits for appeal<br/>provided in each level shall begin the day following receipt of the written decision by<br/>the parties in interest.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in personnel<br/>files of any of the participants.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making reports and<br/>recommendations, and other necessary documents will be prepared by the District<br/>Superintendent in conjunction with and approved by the Association and given<br/>appropriate distribution by the Association so as to facilitate operation of the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the Association to attend a<br/>grievance meeting or hearing, the representative will, upon request to the District<br/>Superintendent by the President of the Association, be released without loss of pay in<br/>order to permit participation in the foregoing activities.</p>
