<p>ARTICLE VI_</p>
<p>6. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>6.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>6.1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is an allegation by a grievant that she/he has been adversely affected by a<br/>violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a specific provision of this Agreement.<br/>Actions to challenge or change the policies of the District or the administrative regulations<br/>and procedures must be undertaken under separate legal processes. Matters for which a<br/>specific method of review is provided by law, are not within the scope of this procedure.</p>
<p>6.1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; may be any certificated employee of the District covered by the terms of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>6.1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is a day in which the grievant is required to render service to the District.</p>
<p>6.1.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Immediate supervisor&quot; means the lowest level administrator who has immediate<br/>jurisdiction over a grievant and who has been designated to administer grievances.</p>
<p>6.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an informal conference</p>
<p>with his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>6.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>6.3.1. Level 1</p>
<p>Within twenty (20) school days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to<br/>the grievance, the grievant must present his/her grievance in writing to the immediate<br/>supervisor. If neither the grievant nor the Association had actual or constructive<br/>knowledge of the occurrence of the grievable act or omission and could not with the<br/>exercise of reasonable diligence have known about it, then the twenty (20) day time limit<br/>shall begin to run on the date upon which either the grievant or the Association knew or<br/>could with reasonable diligence have known of the occurrence.</p>
<p>The statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the circumstances<br/>involved, the decision rendered at the informal conference, and the specific remedy<br/>sought.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall communicate his/her decision to the grievant in writing within ten</p>
<p>(10) school days after receiving the grievance. If the supervisor does not respond within<br/>the above time limits, either party may request a personal conference.</p>
<p>6.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 2</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level 1, he/she may appeal<br/>the decision in writing to the Superintendent, or acting Superintendent, within ten (10)<br/>school days.</p>
<p>6.3.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision of the Superintendent, or acting<br/>Superintendent, he/she may proceed to arbitration by notifying the District in writing<br/>within ten (10) days of the Superintendent's decision. Within ten (10) days of such<br/>notification of the District, the grievant shall agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator<br/>and obtain a commitment from said arbitrator within the specified period. The Association<br/>shall file a Demand to Arbitrate to the American Arbitration Association. The selection of<br/>the arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the Voluntary<br/>Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth the findings of fact, reasoning<br/>and conclusions of the issues submitted. The arbitrator will be without power or authority<br/>to make any decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law or which<br/>is in violation of the terms of this Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is<br/>empowered to include in any award such financial reimbursement or other remedies as<br/>he/she judges to be proper. The decision of the arbitrator will be submitted to the<br/>grievant and to the Superintendent. If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the<br/>grievance, such question will be ruled upon by the arbitrator only after he/she has had an<br/>opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>All costs for the service of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem expenses,<br/>his/her travel and subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing room will be borne<br/>equally by the District and the grievant. All other costs, except for release time for the<br/>grievant, his/her representative, and witnesses, will be borne by the party incurring them.</p>

<p>7. CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>7.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to assign pupils in compliance with State law within the constraints of financial<br/>resources and available facilities. The District further agrees to support the assignment of students<br/>within the District in such a manner as to equalize the teaching load within grade levels and/or<br/>subject matter areas insofar as possible.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing limits, pupils shall not be placed in any classroom in larger numbers<br/>than the capacity of the teaching facility and basic work station as mutually agreed upon by unit<br/>member, or his/her designee and building principal. Association representation will be available for<br/>advisement. A basic workstation is defined as an assigned location where a student normally<br/>spends the majority of class time performing the operational functions necessary to meet the<br/>performance objectives and goals of the course. Special education mainstream students will be<br/>considered in the equation when determining class size overages.</p>
<p>7.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions to recommended class size maximums may be physical education, band, orchestra,<br/>choir, and other similar classes, to be determined cooperatively by the site administrator and the<br/>unit member(s) involved.</p>
<p>7.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When classroom size, equipment, and furniture permit, class size maximums may be exceeded by<br/>providing additional teaching aide hours in accordance with District policy.</p>
<p>7.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When class size exceeds recommended levels established in Board Policy, the following procedure<br/>for resolution shall be enacted.</p>
<p>7.4.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will notify site administrator in writing that class size has exceeded the<br/>recommended levels (Appendix A-13).</p>
<p>7.4.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation will be reviewed by a committee consisting of the unit member, a union<br/>representative, the site administrator and a district office administrator appointed by the<br/>Superintendent. Other pertinent staff may be included by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>7.4.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee's recommendation for resolution will be submitted to the Superintendent<br/>or designee, including timelines for implementation.</p>
<p>7.4.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Superintendent shall have twenty (20) working<br/>days to render a decision and initiate a written plan with specific timelines.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII</p>

Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year<br/>to year. Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence the first day of absence. When<br/>a member of the bargaining unit is absent from his/her duties on account of an industrial<br/>accident or illness, he/she shall be paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any<br/>month in which the absence occurs, when added to his/her temporary disability<br/>indemnity under Division 4 or 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in payment to him/her of<br/>not more than his/her full salary. The phrase &quot;full salary&quot; as utilized in this section shall be<br/>computed so that it shall not be less than the unit member's average weekly earnings as<br/>that phrase is utilized in Section 4453 of the Labor Code. For purposes of this section,<br/>however, the maximum and minimum average weekly earnings as set forth in Section<br/>4453 of the Labor Code shall otherwise not be deemed applicable. Industrial accident or<br/>illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of authorized absence regardless of<br/>a temporary disability indemnity award. When an industrial accident or illness leave<br/>overlaps into the next fiscal year, the unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of<br/>unused leave due him/her for the same illness or injury. Upon termination of the<br/>industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member shall be entitled to the benefits<br/>provided in Section 44977, 44978 and 44983 of the California Education Code, and for the<br/>purposes of each of these sections, his/her absence shall be deemed to have commenced<br/>on the date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, provided that if the</p>

In those instances where the<br/>ending date of the pregnancy disability is expected to exceed six (6) weeks following the<br/>birth or miscarriage, the District may require the unit member to be examined by a<br/>District selected physician.

<p>Please refer to the attached CVT Blue Cross Prudent Buyer Options for health coverage comparisons. For more<br/>information about health plan coverage, call the Personnel Department. You may call Blue Cross directly at 800-234-<br/>4333 or visit the Blue Cross web site at <a href="http://www.bluecrossca.com">www.bluecrossca.com</a>.</p>
<p>Rates are set through contract provisions with California's Value Trust and are subject to change annually in<br/>October. C.U.E.A. has an open enrollment period every September for plan changes. The Payroll Department will<br/>automatically deduct the unit member's portion from their monthly paychecks beginning with the month the coverage<br/>becomes effective.</p>
<p>Full-time unit members are required to participate in medical, dental and vision. If a unit member has dependents<br/>(spouse and children), it is strongly recommended they are enrolled at the time the unit member becomes eligible. All<br/>plans include spouse/dependent coverage at no additional cost. If a family member is not enrolled at the time of<br/>enrollment, they must wait until an open enrollment period to be added.</p>
<p>Unit members who work the full school year will be covered for 12 months. Those unit members hired less than full¬<br/>time are offered benefits on a pro-rata basis consistent with their contract percentage; OR they may opt for no<br/>coverage. The district urges any unit member who anticipates being on an unpaid leave of absence to contact the<br/>Personnel Department to determine what impact, if any, their leave will create for insurance purposes.</p>
<p>We recommend unit members call Blue Cross with any questions prior to any treatments/services in order to fully<br/>understand the definitions and liabilities for your out-of-pocket expense and the differences between deductibles and<br/>co-pays and fiscal year versus calendar year payments.</p>
<p>District Paid Insurances</p>
<p>Disability Insurance</p>
<p>Disability insurance is provided for all unit members who have a contract that equals .5<br/>FTE. The Payroll Department will automatically enroll eligible staff members in this program<br/>upon the first month of hire. This is a district paid benefit, and there is no cost to the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>Disability coverage begins on the 11<sup>th</sup> consecutive day of an illness or injury. It is the<br/>responsibility of the unit member to notify the Payroll Department when he/she becomes<br/>eligible for benefits. To qualify for benefits, forms must be completed by the district, unit<br/>member, and attending physician/care provider and submitted to the disability carrier.</p>
<p>Life Insurance</p>
<p>Life insurance for staff members is also provided by the district for unit members working<br/>20 or more hours per week or have a contract that equals .5 FTE or more. The Payroll<br/>Department will enroll all eligible unit members upon completion of the enrollment form. This<br/>is a district paid benefit, and there is no cost to the unit member.</p>
<p>Supplemental life insurance is available to unit members through a payroll deduction.<br/>Please contact the Payroll Department for further information.</p>

<p>Calaveras Unified School District</p>
<p>Appendix A-9</p>
<p>Tier I — Summary</p>
<p>Directed Supervision for New/Beginning Teachers</p>
<p>Participants:</p>
<p>New teachers will be placed in Tier I for two years. Participants in Tier I will include the following groups: 1) new<br/>teachers eligible for BTSA; 2) new teachers not-eligible for BTSA such as, but not limited to interns, teachers on<br/>emergency credentials, temporary teachers; and 3) experienced teachers new to the district.</p>
<p>Participation in Tier I will be for two years with the option of a third year determined by the teacher and/or by the<br/>administrator after collaborative discussion. Participation in the third year in no way precludes the teacher being<br/>granted tenure, which will occur in any case on his/her first day of the third year of instruction.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of directed supervision is to ensure that the Standards for the Teaching Profession are understood,<br/>accepted, and satisfactorily demonstrated. An additional purpose is to introduce new staff to programs, procedures, and<br/>policies, and to reinforce the expectations of the district. Teachers will be provided with training and support in<br/>understanding and implementing the district standards. The district standards include the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession (CSTP), Academic Content Standards for California Public Schools, and performance standards. The<br/>purpose of directed supervision is to ensure that teaching is of the highest quality by providing administrators with<br/>ample opportunity to observe, analyze and discuss teaching practices and use these to evaluate teacher competency.</p>
<p>Procedure/Methods:</p>
<p>The Individual Development Plan will be completed by the teacher with administrative input within the first four<br/>weeks of the school year.</p>
<p>The intent of formal observation is to gather data on classroom practices and instruction as they relate to the<br/>standards of the teaching profession, and provide structured feedback and suggestions on performance.</p>
<p>For the teacher in his/her first year as a district unit member, that first year will include a minimum of three formal<br/>observations. All of these formal observations will include a pre-conference no more than two instructional days (of<br/>mutual attendance) prior to the observation and a post-conference within five instructional days (of mutual attendance)<br/>of the observation. The written report on the observation will be prepared before the post-conference and presented to<br/>the teacher at that conference. It will form the basis for the discussion of the lesson. The teacher will have ten days from<br/>the day of the post- conference to prepare comments on the report and have them attached to it before placement in<br/>the teacher's personnel file. The administrator will conduct the first formal observation before the winter break.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Calaveras Unified School District</p>
<p>Appendix A-9</p>
<p>Tier I Summary<br/>Page 2</p>
<p>An evaluation summary conference will be held before January 31st. The Administrative Evaluation Summary Report<br/>will be presented to the teacher at least two days before the evaluation summary conference and will be the basis for<br/>that conference. The teacher will have ten working days from the day of that conference to prepare comments on the<br/>evaluation and have them attached to it before placement in the teacher's personnel file. The third formal observation<br/>will take place before April 1<sup>st</sup>. The post-conference will be held within five instructional days (of mutual attendance) of<br/>the observation. The second Administrative Evaluation Summary Report will be provided to the teacher no later than<br/>May 1<sup>st</sup> with the same conference and timeline requirements.</p>
<p>For the teacher in his/her second year as a district unit member, that second year will include a minimum of two<br/>formal observations. The first observation will occur before the winter break, and the teacher will be provided with an<br/>Administrative Evaluation Summary Report before January 31<sup>st</sup>. The second observation will occur before April 1<sup>st</sup>, and<br/>the final Administrative Evaluation Summary Report will be provided to the teacher no later than May 1<sup>st</sup>. Again, the<br/>same conferences and timelines will apply to these events as applied during the first year.</p>
<p>The administrator will also make informal observations during the year, which will provide opportunities for ongoing<br/>verbal and/or written feedback. Informal observations may occur any time during the school day or during school-<br/>related events. These may include observations of instruction; various forms of supervision; department meetings;<br/>interactions with students, parent and colleagues; preparation for and performance at IEP meetings; and other times<br/>not listed. Informal observations may vary in length, and conversations or written remarks may vary in depth.</p>

<p>Tier II — Summary</p>
<p>Self-Directed Professional Growth Plan for Tenured Professionals<br/>Participants:</p>
<p>Participants are tenured teachers who are demonstrating a competency in the Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession. Teachers may participate as part of a team (with grade level colleagues, members of department teams,<br/>across schools or in any combination), or teachers may elect to work individually. In cases of inter-school teams, all<br/>administrators of the involved schools are included in the planning.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The teacher and administrator work collaboratively to ensure the continuing development of the Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession, enhance professional growth, focus on school/district/state improvement initiatives and improved<br/>student achievement. The teacher receives feedback on his/her progress toward meeting these objectives.</p>
<p>Procedure/Method:</p>
<p>The teacher develops and implements a professional growth plan with administrative input. Professional growth<br/>plans may continue for one, two, or three years. (Professional growth plans may be annually or in a multiyear format up<br/>to five years, in accordance with AB954. In no event will multiyear plans have a formal annual meeting requirement,<br/>([per CUSD/CUEA settlement for the 2004-05 and 2005-06 school years]) Plans may be revised and/or expanded<br/>dependent on mutual agreement of teacher and administrator. The teacher will reflect on and summarize his/her<br/>progress in an Annual Summary, if mutually agreed upon during the initial development of the professional growth plan<br/>or throughout the course of the plan. Professional growth plan activities and methods may include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action research</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer coaching</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-assessment of teaching through video taping</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentoring</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graduate course work</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom observations (formal and/or informal)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of teaching materials/instructions units</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion groups (participant meetings)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workshops (instructor or participant)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School improvement team participation</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflective journal or log of activities</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary participation in PAR (Peer Assistance and Review) with PAR panel approval</p>

<p>Tier III -Summary</p>
<p>Professional Assistance Plan</p>
<p>Participants:</p>
<p>Tenured teachers in need of specific professional assistance/ guidance in identified areas of the Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession, as determined by the site administrator through the evaluation process, will be placed in Tier<br/>III/PAR. Participation is mandatory, based on the administrator's unsatisfactory evaluation.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>This tier will provide a structured process for a teacher who will receive focused support Ideally, professional<br/>assistance is based on the recognition that specifically directed assistance in identified areas will lead to success in<br/>the classroom. Assistance should be collaborative, but may also be directive. It is intended to provide the greatest<br/>likelihood for attainment of competency and professional growth.</p>
<p>Procedure/Method:</p>
<p>The administrator identifies areas of concern relating to fundamental competencies that are characteristic of the<br/>teacher's performance. Areas of concern will be based on multiple indicators, such as formal/informal<br/>observations, student achievement data and student/parent feedback. Based on documentation of an area(s) of<br/>concern relating to one or more of the Standards for the Teaching Profession, the administrator will develop a<br/>Professional Assistance Plan. The administrator will implement the plan with the participating teacher and the PAR<br/>consulting teacher. The specific plan developed will include the following: goals identifying area(s) of needed<br/>improvement, strategies to resolve the concern(s), indicators of progress, timelines for completion of the goals, and<br/>resources as needed to support the Professional Assistance Plan. See Appendix for tools as indicators of progress<br/>for completion of the goals connected to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>For the teacher in Tier III, he/she will have a minimum of three formal observations. All of these formal<br/>observations will include a pre-conference no more than two instructional days (of mutual attendance) prior to the<br/>observation and a post conference within five instructional days (of mutual attendance) after the observation. The<br/>written report on the observation will be prepared before the post conference and presented to the teacher at that<br/>conference. It will form the basis for the discussion of the lesson. The teacher will have ten days from the day of the<br/>post conference to prepare comments on the report and have them attached to it before placement in the teacher's<br/>personnel file. The administrator will conduct the first formal observation of a complete lesson within the first<br/>eight weeks of instruction and the second formal observation before the winter break. An evaluation summary<br/>conference will be held before January 31st The Administrative Evaluation Summary Report will be presented to<br/>the teacher at least two days (of mutual attendance) before the evaluation summary conference and will be the<br/>basis for that conference. The teacher will have ten working days from the day of that conference to prepare<br/>comments on the evaluation and have them attached to it before placement in the teacher's personnel file. The<br/>third formal observation will take place by March 1st The post-conference will be held within five instructional<br/>days (of mutual attendance) of the observation. The second Administrative Evaluation Summary Report will be<br/>provided to the teacher no later than March 15th with the same conference and timeline requirements.</p>
<p>The administrator will also make informal observations during the year, which will provide opportunities for on¬<br/>going verbal and/ or written feedback. Informal observations may occur any time during the school day or during<br/>school-related events. These may include observations of instruction; various forms of supervision; department<br/>meetings; interactions with students, parents and colleagues; preparation for and performance at IEP meetings;<br/>and other times not listed. Informal observations may vary in length, and conversations or written remarks may<br/>vary in depth.</p>
<p>The teacher works to resolve the problem(s) through implementation of the Professional Assistance Plan. The<br/>teacher will return to Tier II status upon successful completion of the plan and demonstration of satisfactory<br/>teaching practices.</p>
