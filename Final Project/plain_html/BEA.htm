<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. Introduction</p>
<p>A return-to-work program is a widely recognized management tool for reducing Workers’<br/>Compensation expenses.</p>
<p>Following a work-related injury, teachers should be returned to the work site as soon as<br/>possible subsequent to determination of medical compatibility, to perform professional<br/>duties in an appropriate work area.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>This Transitional Return-to-Work Program is designed to move teachers from a disability<br/>environment to a position of “productivity.” When properly administered, programs of<br/>this nature have improved employee relations, as well as reduced overall costs of work<br/>injuries.</p>
<p>In order to assist industrially injured employees with the recovery process and to<br/>encourage an early return to unrestricted duty status, the District will implement a<br/>program which utilizes temporary retum-to-work (transitional) assignments to<br/>accommodate teachers who are unable to perform their normal duties. This may be<br/>structured in the following order:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restricted duties within the same site</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different duties within the same site</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restricted or different duties at an alternate site as agreed upon by employee and<br/>administration.</p>
<p>II. Definition and Parameters</p>
<p>Transitional assignments are temporary assignments of modified or light duty to assist the<br/>injured or ill teacher to progressively escalate to full-duty status and is only available for<br/>approved Workers’ Compensation claims. This type of duty is a “transitional” process,<br/>which enables the teacher to gradually resume his/her full-time duties. The maximum<br/>duration of the transitional assignment period will not exceed sixty (601 calendar<br/>days per injury or illness.</p>
<p>III. Program Objectives</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a means for an injured/ill teacher to return to the workplace as<br/>soon as safely possible without danger of re-injury.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide a means of maintaining the teacher’s instructional skills and<br/>providing continuity for students, while enabling him/her to progress to<br/>full-duty status.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain organizational productivity by allowing the teacher to perform tasks that<br/>would require extra help.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce the number of lost-time injuries thereby reducing the amount of temporary<br/>and permanent disability costs.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce the number of litigated claims.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce the need for temporary help due to the absence of the injured teacher.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicate with the injured teacher and enhance his/her perception of the<br/>District’s concern for their well-being.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce the use and cost of outside rehabilitation vendors and the overall costs<br/>associated with rehabilitation.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce extended periods of medical treatment and associated costs. Injured<br/>employee recovery periods are lessened if temporary transitional assigmnents are<br/>made available in lieu of remaining at home.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce outstanding claim reserves which will ultimately favorably impact District<br/>experience modification factors.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharge the District’s obligations under the Labor Code, Education Code, and<br/>Employee Bargaining Unit Contracts.</p>
<p>IV. Program Provisions</p>
<p>A, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances does this program intend to permanently establish new<br/>assignments or displace other employees. Its intent is to utilize the resources of a<br/>teacher for the District.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes the benefits of implementing a Transitional Return-to-Work<br/>Program in accordance with the aforementioned terms and, therefore, agrees to<br/>voluntarily participate in adopting such a program.

<p>Prior to receiving a rating of “partially meets standard” or “unsatisfactory” on the final evaluation in any<br/>standard or standard category, a focus plan will be developed using the district adopted Focus Plan and<br/>Follow-up Focus Plan forms. This focus plan is developed in cooperation with the employee and<br/>includes, but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Identified elements needing improvement<br/>Specific plan for improvement<br/>Additional resources to implement plan<br/>Techniques to measure improvement<br/>Time schedule to monitor progress</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District management shall evaluate all permanent bargaining unit members at least once<br/>every two (2) years and all probationary bargaining unit members at least annually.</p>
<p>Permanent employees who have been employed by the District for at least ten years, are highly<br/>qualified, and whose previous evaluation met all standards may be evaluated at least once every<br/>five years.</p>
<p>For purposes of determining the time line of 5 years related to the evaluation of permanent<br/>certificated employees under Ed. Code Section 44664, BEA and BUSD agree that the intervening<br/>5 years will be factored by academic year from the year of the last evaluation.</p>
<p>For example, if an employee was evaluated in academic year 02-03, then the employee would be<br/>scheduled for evaluation in 07-08 and so forth.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall be the unit member's immediate supervisor and/or any other management or<br/>supervisory employee who is so designated by the District management and agreed upon by unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The designated evaluator and the unit member scheduled to be evaluated will meet to determine<br/>the evaluation process for the year no later than October 1. This meeting will focus on:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of the two in-depth standards domains, one selected by the evaluatee and the<br/>other by the administrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategies to be used by the administrator for evaluation would include:</p>
<p>► &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a review of the teaching standards</p>
<p>► &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected frequency of walk-through</p>
<p>► &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the desired lesson observation fonnat</p>
<p>► &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tentative schedule of collaborative discussion opportunities regarding the<br/>evaluatee’s progress toward meeting these standards</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tentative date for an end-of-the-year evaluation conference</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a discussion of the types of support available for the evaluatee, i.e., peer mentoring, pre-<br/>intem coaches, PAR consultants, staff development opportunities, resource materials,<br/>professional literature, networking, etc.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>Each of the six California Standards for the Teaching Profession -enhanced to meet district<br/>needs (see California Standards in APPENDIX D)—will be evaluated using a code of <sup>4</sup>M’ (meets<br/>standard), ‘P’ (partially meets standard), and ‘U’ (unsatisfactory).

<p>Article XXIII - Bargaining Unit Member Safety</p>
<p>.........................................................................imimimnimniOlm—.........mm...........................................................................................</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member has a responsibility to refer to the site administrator any student who<br/>exhibits belligerent behavior.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall immediately report cases of assault suffered by them in connection with their<br/>employment to their principal or other immediate supervisor. Principals or immediate supervisors are<br/>required (per Education Code 49079) to provide disposition of their paperwork on the matter.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As per Education Code 49079, the District has a responsibility to notify teachers of a student who<br/>has engaged in a violent act.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this Article &quot;within the scope of this employment&quot; shall include any voluntary activities<br/>(such as a field trip) provided that the proper procedures and permission were approved prior to the<br/>voluntary activity.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1'he District is required to provide periodic updates for safety training and dealing with actual or<br/>potential physically violent students.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal Drug and Alcohol Use</p>
<p>a. The purpose of this article is to eliminate substance abuse and its effects in the work place.<br/>While unit members have certain rights to privacy, involvement with illegal drugs and<br/>alcohol can take its toll on job performance and employee safety. Unit members must be in a<br/>condition to perform their duties safely and efficiently, in the interest of students, fellow<br/>workers, and the public as well as themselves.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>The presence of illegal drugs and alcohol on the job and the influence of these substances on<br/>employees during working hours are inconsistent with this objective.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide an Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Unit members who<br/>think they have an alcohol- or illegal drug-usage problem are urged to voluntarily seek<br/>confidential counseling through the EAP.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be under the influence of or in possession of illegal drugs or alcohol<br/>while on District property, at work locations, or while on duty or at sponsored activities.<br/>Unit members shall not sell or provide illegal drugs or alcohol to any other employee or to<br/>any person while such employee is on duty or subject to being called to duty, nor have their<br/>ability to work impaired as a result of the use of illegal drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member reasonably believed to be using illegal drugs or alcohol may be required to<br/>submit to a urine, blood, breath and/or other designated medical or chemical tests for<br/>evidence of illegal drugs and/or alcohol use. The cost of the tests shall be paid by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reasonable suspicion” is a belief based on objective facts sufficient to lead a reasonably<br/>prudent supervisor or manager to suspect that a unit member is under the influence of illegal<br/>drugs or alcohol so that the unit member’s ability to perform the functions of the job is<br/>impaired or so that the unit member’s ability to perform his/her job safety is reduced.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, any of the following, alone or in combination, may constitute reasonable<br/>suspicion:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slurred speech</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcohol odor on breath</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsteady walking and movement</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving District property</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious accident causing injury</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical altercation</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal altercation</p>
<p>(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unusual behavior</p>
<p>(9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possession of illegal drugs or alcohol</p>
<p>(10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information obtained from a reliable person with personal knowledge</p>
<p>(11) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to pass field sobriety test.</p>
<p>Anonymous information shall not constitute the sole basis for reasonable suspicion.</p>
<p>Refusal to submit to the testing when reasonable suspicion exists shall constitute<br/>insubordination, which is cause for dismissal.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A positive result from an illegal drug and/or alcohol analysis may result in a disciplinary<br/>action, up to and including dismissal.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>h. Depending upon the circumstances the District, in its sole discretion, may offer the unit<br/>member an opportunity to enter into a rehabilitation agreement prior to taking disciplinary<br/>action. Unit members entering a rehabilitation program in lieu of discipline shall be required<br/>to submit to random testing for up to one (1) year after completion of the program. Violation<br/>of the rehabilitation agreement shall be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including<br/>dismissal</p>
<p>While receiving medical treatment for illegal drug or alcohol abuse, the unit member shall be<br/>eligible to apply for sick leave and long-term sick-leave benefits.</p>
<p>Article XXIV - Bargaining Unit Member Travel</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall pay the prevailing amount per mile for bargaining unit members who are daily<br/>assigned by the District to two (2) or more schools.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members shall receive the prevailing amount per mile when using their personal<br/>vehicle, providing such use is for official school business and the unit member receives prior<br/>authorization from their immediate supervisor and no District car is available.</p>
<p>Article XXV - Physical Examinations</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examinations for tuberculosis shall be required every four (4) years at District expense.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require any certificated employee to submit to a physical or mental examination at<br/>District expense. (Does not include pre-employment physical.)</p>
