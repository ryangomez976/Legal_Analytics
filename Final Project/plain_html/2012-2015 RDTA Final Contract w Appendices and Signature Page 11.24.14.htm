<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that a Grievance be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits<br/>specified at each level should be considered to be maximum, and every effort should be<br/>made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be extended or compressed<br/>by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Section III: Procedure</p>
<p>A Grievance or Grievances shall be presented and adjusted in accordance with the following<br/>procedures:</p>
<p>A. Level I</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal</p>
<p>Within fifteen (15) Days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the<br/>Grievance, the Grievant shall first discuss the matter with the administrator involved.</p>
<p>The Grievant then may go to his/her Immediate Supervisor either (1) individually or (2) if<br/>the Grievant so requests, accompanied by a representative of the Association with the<br/>objective of resolving the matter informally. If the problem is solved, the case is closed.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal</p>
<p>If the problem is still unresolved after the informal conference, the Grievant shall, within</p>
<p>five (5) Days after the conference, present a statement of Grievance in writing to his/her</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) Days after receiving the decision of the Immediate Supervisor, the<br/>Grievant may appeal to the Superintendent. The appeal shall be accompanied by a<br/>copy of the decision reached at Level I and the Immediate Supervisor shall be notified<br/>of the appeal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wthin fifteen (15) Days after delivery of the appeal, the Superintendent or designee<br/>shall communicate a decision in writing, together with supporting reasons, to the<br/>Grievant, his/her representative, if any, the Immediate Supervisor, and the Association.<br/>During the first five (5) Days of the fifteen (15) Days, the Grievant may request a<br/>meeting to discuss the Grievance with the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall<br/>meet with the Grievant and the Grievant may have the Association representative<br/>present.</p>
<p>C. Level III - Binding Arbitration</p>

If the Association<br/>proceeds to arbitration, it shall notify the District in writing within ten (10) Days. Wthin ten<br/>(10) Days of such notification, representatives of the District and the Association shall<br/>attempt to agree upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator and obtain a commitment from said<br/>arbitrator to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within the specified<br/>period, the Association shall file a Demand to Arbitrate with the California State Mediation<br/>and Conciliation Service or with the American Arbitration Association. The selection of the<br/>arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the Voluntary Labor<br/>Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth the findings of fact, reasoning,<br/>and conclusion of the issues submitted.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall be subject to the following limitations:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, disregard, alter, or modify<br/>any of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to establish salary structures or change any salary.<br/>This limitation does not apply to a recommendation to change placement on the salary<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to recommend or evaluate issues involving the<br/>content of evaluation except as provided in Article XVII, Section I, C., 3., d.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to establish or recommend financial awards.</p>
<p>7</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenses incurred by the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the District and the<br/>Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them, and neither<br/>party shall be responsible for the expenses of witnesses called by the other. The<br/>Grievant and the Association representative shall have release time to process the<br/>Grievance.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Grievance has been considered by the parties in the preceding steps<br/>of the Grievance shall not constitute a waiver of jurisdiction limitations upon the<br/>arbitrator in this Agreement.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No probationary Unit Member may use the Grievance procedure in any way to appeal<br/>discharge or a decision by the District not to renew his/her contract.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure at any step of this procedure to render a decision on a Grievance within the<br/>specified time limits shall indicate acceptance of the Grievance, except when the<br/>Immediate Supervisor or administrator is on personal or school business leave, or ill.<br/>Failure to appeal a decision within the specified time limits shall be deemed an acceptance<br/>of the decision.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferences held under the procedure shall be conducted at a time and place which will<br/>afford a fair and reasonable opportunity for all persons entitled to be present to attend. In<br/>all steps of the Grievance procedure, when it becomes necessary for individuals to be<br/>involved during school hours, release time shall be provided for that purpose.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member may have representation by another Unit Member or by a member of the<br/>Association Executive Board at all steps in the procedure.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an emergency, the Unit Member may appeal directly to the Superintendent who may<br/>agree to waive Level I after consultation with the Immediate Supervisor.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a Grievance is filed on or after June 1, the time limits set forth herein may be<br/>reduced by mutual agreement so that the Grievance procedure may be concluded prior to<br/>the end of the school term, or as soon thereafter as possible.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written notices to be filed under this procedure may be hand-delivered to the appropriate<br/>person, or left with a person in charge of the office of the appropriate person, or mailed by</p>

<p>3548.5, 3548.6, 3548.7, and 3548.8, and the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms<br/>of a written agreement then in effect; provided that the public school employer shall not<br/>agree to a resolution of the Grievance until the exclusive representative has received a<br/>copy of the Grievance and the proposed resolution, and has been given up to twenty (2)<br/>Days to file a response.</p>

<p>O. Part-Time and Shared Contract Employment</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-Time Employment</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared contract is one in which a 1.0 Full Time Unit Member (FTE) assignment is</p>
<p>shared by 2 Unit Members.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part-time Unit Member is defined as a Unit Member working less than 1.0 FTE who</p>
<p>is employed as and has employment rights to a part-time position, or is a Unit<br/>Member to whom the District has granted a part-time leave, and the percentage of<br/>full-time employment is specified in the employment contract.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for Shared Contracts</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared teaching assignments shall be available to permanent Unit Members who</p>
<p>have mutually agreed to work together or when the District is able to hire a<br/>temporary Unit Member who meets District determined qualifications, to share the<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members who are applying to begin or to continue a shared teaching assignment<br/>must complete the evaluation process and all participants must receive a<br/>satisfactory evaluation before approval can be obtained.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application Procedure and Timeline</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Unit Members seeking part-time or a shared contract must submit a<br/>written request to the Superintendent by January 15 prior to the year the shared<br/>contract assignment is requested.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will review the requests and determine which may be approved. By</p>
<p>January 31, based on the approved requests, the District will publish in house a list<br/>of positions and will advertise outside for temporary Unit Members for shared<br/>contract employment. Permanent Unit Members must submit their applications for<br/>sharing a contract based on the published list, no later than February 10.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 1, the District will notify all Unit Members requesting shared contracts<br/>whether the requests are approved or denied. The District reserves the right to<br/>approve or deny all such requests.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is limited to one (1) pair per eight (8) Unit Members, assigned to a given<br/>site. Part-time Unit Members shall not be counted in this limitation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval of Shared Contracts</p>
<p>Shared contracts shall be approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the<br/>Superintendent that said contracts are in the best interest of the District’s educational<br/>program.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members sharing a contract must accept the responsibility of assuring the staff,<br/>administration, and parents of successful joint planning communication among Unit<br/>Members and parents, and compatible classroom management.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared contracts will reflect all pertinent information concerning the assignment, e.g.,<br/>dates indicating duration of the assignment, description of subject/grade level,<br/>location, salary and benefits. The shared contract will include a statement: “If you<br/>wish to renew this shared position for the next school year, your written request must<br/>be filed in the Superintendent’s office on or before January 1 of the school year to<br/>which this contract applies.”</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members who share a contract must submit to the principal a plan for the shared<br/>position which includes appropriate overlap for a smooth transition, and which shall<br/>not be at a cost to the District.</p>
<p>5. Return to Full-Time Position</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-Time Unit Members who are on part-time leave status or share a contract may<br/>reinstate their full-time status the following year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members intending to return to full-time status in the following year must notify<br/>the District of their intent to do so by February 1 of the year that they wish to return<br/>to full-time status.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members returning to full-time status will be entitled to the same rights as any<br/>other certificated Unit Member, namely to indicate their preference at the time<br/>classroom assignment forms are circulated.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members whose initial contract was for less than full-time as a condition of<br/>employment may apply for full-time employment. The District is under no obligation<br/>to honor the request.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will grant requests for return to full-time status to fill any positions for<br/>which the job sharer is qualified before hiring from outside the District.</p>
<p>6. Compensation</p>
<p>a. Unit Members working part-time shall receive a proportionate amount of the regular<br/>annual salary paid in equal monthly installments agreed upon by the Unit Member<br/>and the District, and shall earn credit for sick leave and other statutory benefits in<br/>proportion to paid District service.</p>
<p>1) At Reed and Bel Aire, the part-time salary shall be computed by taking the<br/>instructional minutes taught by the part-time Unit Member divided by the<br/>instructional minutes taught by a full-time Unit Member at the assigned school to<br/>reach the percentage of FTE. Based on that percentage, part-time Unit Members<br/>are required to be on campus for that percentage of the work day, week or year,</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>whichever applies. Preparation time and non-teaching duties will be pro-rated<br/>based upon the percentage of FTE.</p>
<p>2) For Del Mar Unit Members, each period taught equals 0.2 FTE. Part-time Unit<br/>Members have an advisory, proportionate amount of preparation time and are<br/>required to be on-site during those times.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members hired after December 10, 1992, in a part-time position of 0.5 FTE or<br/>more shall be eligible for a percentage of the District paid benefits based on the<br/>percentage the Unit Member works. The Unit Member will be eligible for full step<br/>advancement at salary proportionate to the part-time position.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Unit Members sharing a full-time position shall share proportionately in<br/>salary and benefits of that position based on their percentage of FTE.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members working part-time/shared contracts will earn a prorated credit towards<br/>retirement credit.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the District requires a part-time or shared contract Unit Member to attend</p>
<p>training, in-service, or parent-teacher conferences on that Unit Member’s non-work<br/>day, the District will compensate at the Unit Member’s per diem rate.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Requirement</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time requirement for a part-time position shall be proportionately based on a</p>
<p>thirty five (35) hour on-site work week.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members in part-time and shared positions will be required to attend</p>
<p>Kindergarten Orientation or Sixth Grade Orientation, if appropriate, Back to School<br/>Night and Open Flouse. Faculty meetings shall be attended unless prior<br/>arrangements have been made with the principal. Other duties and activities shall<br/>equitably be pro-rated according to the respective amounts of work time for the year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that one shared contract partner cannot fulfill his/her teaching obligation,<br/>the other participant shall assume full-time responsibility for the assignment, if<br/>possible.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If and when a substitute is required, the other shared contract participant will assume<br/>responsibility for the class, if possible, and at the District hourly rate set forth in the<br/>Contract, Article XVII, Section IV.B. for working with students.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Status</p>
<p>A part-time Unit member who completes the required probationary period (works 75% of<br/>each of two consecutive Unit Member work years) may earn permanent status for that<br/>same FTE percentage of employment.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>9. Changes Subsequent to the Issuance of Letters of Confirmation or Contracts</p>
<p>If, after the District approves a full-time Unit Member’s request for a shared contract<br/>position, the District finds it necessary to alter the agreed-upon conditions of such<br/>employment, the Unit Member may request a return to a full-time position. The District<br/>shall attempt, but shall not be obligated, to honor the request for that school year, and<br/>the Unit Member shall be entitled to a full-time position starting in the following school<br/>year.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII<br/>LEAVES</p>
<p>The District will continue to provide those leaves of absences mandated by State law,<br/>supplemented by those leaves described in this Article. (See Certificated Leaves Table Appendix<br/>Section 3).</p>

Unit<br/>Members on paid leave or family medical leave shall continue to receive health benefits<br/>paid by the District to the same extent that they received health benefits paid by the<br/>District prior to beginning their leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon return from a leave (except for Sabbatical Leave described in this Article), the Unit<br/>Member will be placed on the salary schedule as he/she would have been in the year<br/>the leave began.</p>

(See Absence<br/>Report Form Appendix Section 4).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in cases of emergency, as determined by the Superintendent, if a Unit Member<br/>is absent and fails to give notice, the Unit Member’s daily rate of pay will be deducted.<br/>The daily rate of pay will be deducted unless the District absence form is signed by the<br/>Unit Member.</p>

<p>end of their particular workday. If a Unit Member fails to give notice within a specified<br/>time limit of his or her intentions to return after illness or accident, and the substitute<br/>appears for the day’s work as a result of failure to receive such notice, the substitute<br/>shall receive a full day’s substitute pay and this amount shall be deducted from the Unit<br/>Member’s salary for that month.</p>
<p>B. Sick Leave</p>
<p>Every full-time Unit Member shall be entitled to ten (10) days of paid sick leave which shall<br/>be cumulative from year to year (without limit), pursuant to Section 44978, et seq., of the<br/>Education Code.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a physician’s verification of illness if a Unit Member has been<br/>on sick leave for four (4) consecutive days. The District may require a physician’s<br/>verification of a Unit Member’s fitness to return to work if the Unit Member has been on<br/>sick leave for ten (10) consecutive days or more.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each Unit Member with a written statement of his/her accrued<br/>sick leave total and sick leave entitlement for the school year. Such statements shall be<br/>provided no later than November 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>C. Personal Leave</p>
<p>1. Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>A Unit Member may use, at his/her election during any school year, not more than nine<br/>(9) days of accumulated sick leave in the case of personal necessity.</p>
<p>“Personal Necessity” is defined as matters that are of compelling personal importance<br/>and the scheduling of which is beyond the control of the Unit Member. Other cases of<br/>personal necessity shall include religious observances and funeral attendance.</p>
<p>a. The Unit Member shall not be required to secure advance permission for leave taken<br/>for the following reasons:</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members may use partial days for personal necessity leave.</p>
<p>2. Personal Discretionary Leave</p>
<p>In any given year, up to four (4) of the nine (9) paid sick leave days available for</p>
<p>personal necessity may be used for personal discretionary leave as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With prior notice and, if the position so requires, conditional upon the availability of a<br/>substitute, a Unit Member may take up to two (2) days consecutively and/or in<br/>conjunction with a holiday, vacation or school break. If more Unit Members request<br/>personal days than there are substitutes available, requests shall be filled on a first<br/>come/first served basis.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification of personal leave shall be given to the Unit Member’s supervisor at the<br/>earliest possible time to facilitate school planning.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members may use any remaining personal discretionary days at their discretion,<br/>but these days may not be taken consecutively, or in conjunction with a holiday,<br/>vacation or school break, and may not be combined with any personal discretionary<br/>days taken pursuant to paragraph 2a above.</p>

All other provisions of sections a, b, c, d, and e (above)<br/>shall remain in force. These “personal” days shall not be cumulative from year to<br/>year, but any unused personal days shall accumulate as part of a Unit Member’s<br/>sick leave account.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>D. Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>A Unit Member is entitled to leave of absence, with full pay, not to exceed three (3) days, or<br/>five (5) days if travel out of state or in excess of 500 miles is required, on account of the<br/>death of any member of his/her immediate family.

<p>20</p>
<p>LONG TERM MEDICAL LEAVES</p>
<p>A. Industrial Accident and Illness Leave</p>
<p>Section 44984 of the Education Code is supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave with pay shall not exceed sixty (60) workdays for the same accident or<br/>illness.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of the Unit Member’s temporary disability indemnity and the portion of the<br/>salary due him/her during his/her absence shall not exceed his/her actual wage if the<br/>Unit Member were on the job.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member shall be deemed to have recovered from an industrial accident or<br/>illness, and thereby able to return to work, at such time as the physician agrees that<br/>there has been such a recovery.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An industrial accident or illness as used in this paragraph means any injury or illness<br/>whose cause can be traced to the performance of services for the District as determined<br/>by findings made by the Marin Schools Insurance Authority Workers’ Compensation<br/>administrator. This does not limit the Unit Member’s right to appeal through the<br/>Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Report of an industrial accident or illness shall be kept on file in the District’s Business<br/>Office.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided in this paragraph are in addition to sick leave benefits.<br/>Accordingly, the District shall not deduct accumulated sick leave from the sick leave<br/>allotment for a Unit Member who is absent as a result of an industrial accident or illness<br/>until Industrial Accident or Illness Leave, if granted, has been exhausted.</p>
<p>B. Family Medical Leave</p>
<p>An eligible Unit Member shall be entitled to up to twelve (12) work weeks of unpaid leave<br/>within a twelve (12) month period for family and medical reasons under the federal Family<br/>and Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the California Family Rights Act (“family medical<br/>leave”). The following provisions shall be interpreted in accordance with those statutes and<br/>accompanying regulations.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member is eligible if he/she has been employed by the District for at least twelve<br/>(12) months and has provided service at least one thousand two hundred fifty hours<br/>(1250) hours over the previous twelve (12) months (normally this means a full-time work<br/>year - i.e., 188 days x 7 hours = 1316 hours).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family medical leave shall be available for the following purposes:</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birth of a Unit Member’s child (see also “Maternity Leave” and “Child Care Leave”<br/>below);</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement of a child with the Unit Member for adoption or foster care (see also<br/>“Child Care Leave” below);</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care for the Unit Member’s child, spouse or parent with a serious health condition;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member’s own serious health condition that keeps the Unit Member from<br/>performing his/her job function (see also “Extended Illness Leave” and “Health<br/>Leave” below).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental<br/>condition involving in-patient care, continuing treatment or supervision of a health care<br/>provider.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may substitute sick leave or other paid leave in place of his/her family<br/>medical leave entitlement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family medical leave will run concurrently with other paid and unpaid leave, except<br/>maternity leave, if the reasons for the leave meet the requirements of family medical<br/>leave.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member taking family medical leave will continue to participate in the District-<br/>provided health plan under the same terms and conditions, including any necessary co¬<br/>payments, which applied prior to the first day of the Unit Member’s leave. The District<br/>and Unit Member are required to make premium payments to the same extent made by<br/>them prior to the leave to maintain his/her health benefits during the leave period. If the<br/>Unit Member fails to return from the leave for any reason other than the recurrence or<br/>continuance of a serious health condition, the Unit Member will be liable to the District<br/>for premiums paid for maintaining the Unit Member’s health coverage. A Unit Member<br/>may at his/her expense participate in all other Unit Member benefit plans offered by the<br/>District during the leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where advance notice is possible, a Unit Member must provide thirty (30) days advance<br/>written notice of the need for the leave. If the need for the leave is unforeseen, written<br/>notice must be given as soon as possible. Failure to provide advance written notice<br/>may delay the granting of leave.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may be required to provide medical certification whenever a serious<br/>health condition of the Unit Member or his/her family member is the reason for the<br/>leave. A second or third medical opinion may be required regarding the Unit Member’s<br/>serious health condition at the District’s expense. In certain circumstances, the Unit<br/>Member may be required to provide recertification of his/her serious health condition<br/>(e.g., when the duration and/or need for the leave is uncertain). Failure to obtain<br/>medical certification, when necessary, may delay the granting of the leave request until<br/>such certification is provided.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may be required to provide periodic reports of his/her status and of<br/>his/her intent to return to work while on leave. Such reports may be required as often<br/>as every thirty (30) days, unless otherwise specified by the Unit Member’s immediate<br/>supervisor.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member on family medical leave for his/her own serious health condition is<br/>required to provide a fitness-for-duty certificate from his/her physician before he/she will<br/>be reinstated to employment.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may be eligible for intermittent leave, or reduced work schedule in the<br/>following circumstances:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the leave is for the birth or placement of a child, leave may be taken on an<br/>intermittent or reduced schedule with District approval.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule whenever it is<br/>medically necessary to care for a Unit Member’s child, spouse or parent with a<br/>serious health condition, or because the Unit Member is seriously ill and unable to<br/>work the Unit Member’s regular work schedule.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intermittent leave of reduced work schedule must be taken within the twelve<br/>(12) work-week period allowed under family medical leave. The Unit Member will be<br/>paid at his/her daily or hourly rate of pay, whichever is applicable, for the time<br/>actually worked.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member’s reduced work schedule or intermittent leave may require the<br/>District to transfer the Unit Member to an appropriate available position with equal<br/>pay and benefits to better accommodate the leave. However, the Unit Member only<br/>will be paid for time actually worked.</p>
<p>C. Extended Illness Leave</p>
<p>1. During each school year, when a Unit Member has exhausted all available sick leave,<br/>including all accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent from his or her duties<br/>on account of illness or accident for an additional period of up to five (5) school months,<br/>whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the employment of the Unit<br/>Member, the amount deducted from the salary due him/her for any of the additional five</p>
<p>(5) months in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a<br/>substitute employed to fill his/her position during his/her absence or, if no substitute Unit<br/>Member was employed, the amount that would have been paid to the substitute had<br/>he/she been employed. The District shall make every reasonable effort to secure the<br/>services of a substitute.</p>
<p>a. The amount deducted from the absent Unit Member’s salary shall be no more than:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First ten (10) days of absence - daily substitute rate</p>

If accumulated<br/>sick leave is exhausted during the period of disability, the Unit Member shall be eligible<br/>for extended illness leave as described in Section K above.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Unit Member intends to take a leave for maternity purposes, at least four months<br/>prior to the expected birth of the child, the Unit Member shall submit to the district a<br/>physician’s statement noting the expected date of birth. A Unit Member may continue<br/>work until the onset of physical disability.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member may claim sick leave pay and/or extended illness pay, for no more<br/>than that limited period of time when the Unit Member’s physician certified in writing on</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>the form provided by the District that she was physically disabled from performing her<br/>duties because of pregnancy, miscarriage, or recovery. (Request for Maternity Leave<br/>Sick Pay or Extended Disability Compensation Appendix Section 6)</p>

<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>FORMAL EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The primary purpose of evaluating Unit Members is to assist those personnel in improving<br/>the performance of their professional tasks, and recognize effective teaching practices<br/>which are aligned with the Vision of a Reed Graduate, thereby promoting the best possible<br/>education for students.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall be responsible for evaluation of Unit Members. Such<br/>evaluation shall be in accord with the criteria and procedures of this Article. By October<br/>1 of each school year, the District shall designate the immediate supervisor for each<br/>Unit Member who works at more than one school site.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members shall receive one of the following recommendations:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory - Meets standards</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory - With improvement needed</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory - Does not meet standards (Improvement Plan needed; required to<br/>participate in peer assistance and review program PAR)</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and Temporary Unit Members are to be formally observed at least twice<br/>each year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary Unit Members and categorical unit members who have not previously<br/>served as permanent Unit Members in the District shall be evaluated annually.<br/>Categorical Unit Members who have received three consecutive “satisfactory<br/>performance” classifications will be evaluated once every other year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members with permanent status who have received a satisfactory evaluation are to<br/>be evaluated once every other year unless there has been a change in teaching<br/>assignment. Unit Members who have received three (3) consecutive “satisfactory”<br/>classifications beyond the probationary year evaluations will be formally evaluated every<br/>third year. Supplementary formal evaluations may be held at the discretion of the<br/>supervisor.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent or other continuing Unit Members receiving a “satisfactory with improvement<br/>needed” shall be evaluated the following year, but must receive either a “satisfactory -<br/>meets standards” or “unsatisfactory - does not meet standards” that following year. An<br/>improvement plan (see Appendix) shall be developed for a Unit Member receiving<br/>“satisfactory with improvement needed” or “unsatisfactory - does not meet standards.”<br/>Unit Members receiving “unsatisfactory - does not meet standards” shall be evaluated<br/>yearly until their performance is “satisfactory - meets standards.” Such Unit Member is<br/>also subject to the remedies afforded by Education Code sections 44932-44944.<br/>Improvement plans will not be written for Unit Members who will not be re-employed for<br/>the following year.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under special circumstances with consent of the Unit Member, Supervisor and<br/>Superintendent, the evaluation may be postponed.</p>
<p>C. Basis of Evaluation</p>
<p>Unit Members shall be evaluated based upon Performance Competency: The District shall<br/>evaluate and assess certificated Unit Member competency as it reasonably relates to The<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession (See Appendix Section 1D) and progress<br/>towards completion of performance goals.</p>
<p>D. Data for Evaluation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data to facilitate such evaluations may include but is not limited to: observations,<br/>products, teacher-made and criterion-referenced tests and anecdotal records.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following items shall not be considered valid as data for purposes of evaluating Unit<br/>Members: standardized test scores, achievement of objectives stated in Individual<br/>Educational Programs of Special Education students, student surveys, and parent<br/>judgment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator must include in the formal evaluation a list of any major constraints which</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>may have hindered the Unit Member’s achievement of performance goals, and<br/>adherence to The California Standards for the Teaching Profession. The Unit Member<br/>may append to this formal evaluation a statement which may include additional<br/>constraints.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall compile data on Unit Members. No Unit Member shall be required<br/>to collect or provide data, or written assessment of any other Unit Member. This<br/>provision does not preclude Unit Members from contributing evaluation data to<br/>administrators for classroom aides.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private life of a Unit Member shall not be a part of an evaluation conducted<br/>according to the procedure of this section except as it may impair the Unit Member’s<br/>performance of his/her assigned duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>E. Performance Goals</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluator and Unit Member shall jointly develop in writing, on forms provided (See<br/>Performance Goals Form in Appendix Section IE), two goals aligned to the District<br/>Strategic Plan, the School Plan and/or recommendations in the previous summative<br/>evaluation. Unit Members may add a third goal at their discretion. Those Unit members<br/>not in their formal evaluation year will still participate in setting performance goals<br/>according to the timeline, and a follow-up conference with their supervisor by June 1 of<br/>the school year. Unit Members who are being formally evaluated will discuss<br/>performance goals at the pre-summative conference.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September 15, unit Members shall be provided with the following information:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual goals from the District Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action plans from School Site Plan.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California Standards for the Teaching Profession rubric (Appendix Section ID).</p>
<p>Unit Members are expected to be familiar with these materials.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 15, each Unit member shall meet with the evaluator responsible for his/her<br/>evaluation for a performance goals conference. The Unit Member shall bring to the<br/>conference draft goals using the appropriate District form (See Appendix Section 1E).</p>
<p>At the conference the Unit Member’s previous formal evaluations are reviewed to<br/>identify areas needing strengthening or improvement. The Unit Member’s general<br/>performance is reviewed in relation to The California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession and the job description. At the conclusion of the conference, the mutually<br/>agreed upon performance goals are committed to in writing, on the applicable District<br/>form. A copy of these performance goals is given to the Unit Member for signature.</p>
<p>The Unit Member shall sign and return it within ten (10) calendar days of its receipt.</p>
<p>The original copy will be sent to the Superintendent for the Unit Member’s personnel<br/>file. A copy will be maintained by the principal and Unit Member.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>4. Should there be a failure to reach mutual agreement on administrator/Unit Member<br/>jointly developed performance goals, an appeal shall be filed with the Superintendent or<br/>designated administrator who shall adjudicate the disagreement.</p>
<p>F. Formal Observations</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All formal classroom observations of work performance shall be conducted openly and</p>
<p>with full knowledge of the Unit Member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When formal observations are used to obtain evaluation data they shall be conducted in</p>
<p>the following manner:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observations may begin as early as October 15 and shall be completed no<br/>later than May 1.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and Temporary Unit Members will have at least one formal observation<br/>by December 1.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall schedule the formal observation at least five (5) working days in<br/>advance.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member will provide the evaluator with a written lesson plan (see form in<br/>Appendices), with or without a pre-observation conference, at least two working<br/>days prior to the evaluation.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator will not interrupt instruction during the observation.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within seven (7) working days following any such observational visitation, the<br/>evaluator shall meet with the Unit Member to discuss the observation and to<br/>complete a written report of the observation. (See Formal Observation: Written<br/>Report Form Appendix Section 1C). The written observation report shall include<br/>commendations and recommendations for improvement. Deficiencies, if any, shall<br/>be noted, along with supporting evidence.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written observation report shall contain specific recommendations to assist the<br/>Unit Member in correcting cited deficiencies.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the evaluator’s completion of the written report, the Unit Member shall receive<br/>a copy of the form. The Unit Member shall acknowledge the evaluator’s formal<br/>observation report by signing and returning it. This signature does not acknowledge<br/>agreement with the formal observation report, but only that a copy was received and<br/>read. Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the formal observation report,<br/>the Unit Member may respond to the evaluator’s comments. The original copy of the<br/>observation report, including the Unit Member’s signature and the Unit Member’s<br/>comments, if any, will be sent to the Superintendent for the Unit Member’s personnel<br/>file, and a copy will be maintained by the principal.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>3. No Unit Member may receive a “Satisfactory - with improvement needed” or an</p>
<p>“Unsatisfactory - does not meet standards” unless two (2) or more formal observations<br/>have been conducted.</p>
<p>G. Pre-Summative Evaluation Conference</p>
<p>1. A pre-summative evaluation conference shall be held before the preparation of the<br/>written Summative Evaluation. It shall be conducted in the following manner:</p>
<p>a. The evaluator and Unit Member shall discuss the evaluative data as it relates to the<br/>Unit Member’s job description, performance in relation to the identified performance<br/>goals, and performance as it relates to The California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession. The Unit Member shall bring to the conference a self-appraisal using<br/>the Summative Evaluation form checklist which shall be discussed at the<br/>conference.</p>
<p>H. Final Summative Evaluation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall prepare a written summative evaluation report which shall be<br/>delivered to the Unit Member no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the end of<br/>the school year. (See Certificated: Summative Evaluation Report Form Appendix<br/>Section 1F).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summative Evaluation shall include ratings based on The California Standards for<br/>the Teaching Profession, Performance Goals and job description, and indicate if the<br/>Unit Member’s overall performance is: 1) Satisfactory - meets standards; 2) Satisfactory<br/>with improvement needed; or 3) Unsatisfactory - does not meet standards (required to<br/>participate in PAR).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Unit Member’s evaluation is “unsatisfactory” or is “satisfactory with improvement<br/>needed” the summative evaluation must include recommendations for improvement. An<br/>Improvement Plan will be developed within ten (10) working days and attached to the<br/>summative evaluation. The evaluator and Unit Member shall attempt to mutually agree<br/>on the procedures. In the event agreement cannot be reached, the evaluator will<br/>determine the plan.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Improvement Plan shall include a timeline and a statement of areas of performance<br/>needing improvement. It shall also specify the Unit Member’s responsibility and District<br/>assistance. These recommendations can be modified or added to by mutual agreement<br/>during the next employment year. Release time may be provided if the District<br/>considers it appropriate. The Unit Member must show a strict adherence to the specific<br/>recommendations.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the evaluator and the Unit Member agree that subsequent remedial action has<br/>corrected the identified deficiencies, a statement of such improvement shall be included<br/>in the next evaluation.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at completion of the timeline for the improvement plan, the District determines that the<br/>deficiencies have not been corrected, an involuntary transfer or a reassignment may be<br/>made as a further effort to provide an opportunity for the Unit Member to improve.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members receiving an “Unsatisfactory - does not meet standards” evaluation will<br/>be referred to the Peer Assistance and Review Program under Article XVIII.</p>
<p>Participation in PAR is mandatory for Unit Members receiving an “Unsatisfactory - does<br/>not meet standards” evaluation.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member shall acknowledge the evaluator’s summative evaluation by signing it.<br/>This signature does not acknowledge agreement with the summative evaluation, but<br/>only that a copy was received and read. Unit Members may request copies of<br/>evaluation data presented at the summative evaluation conference.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member has the right to attach a response to his/her own summative<br/>evaluation. Such a statement shall be part of his/her permanent file and shall be<br/>submitted within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt of the evaluation.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original copy of the summative evaluation including the Unit Member’s signature,<br/>comments, and response if included, and formal observation forms shall be forwarded<br/>to the Superintendent and placed in the Unit Member’s permanent personnel file; a copy<br/>shall be returned to the Unit Member and a copy placed in the principal’s temporary<br/>personnel file at the school.</p>
<p>I. Personnel File</p>
<p>A Unit Member shall be permitted to review and obtain a copy of the materials in his/her<br/>District personnel file which may serve as the basis for affecting his/her evaluation.<br/>Evaluation Reports shall be maintained in the Unit Member’s personnel file. All such<br/>material placed in the file shall be dated and signed by the person who caused the<br/>materials to be placed in the file.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature shall not be entered or filed unless and until the Unit<br/>Member is given a copy of the material, and an opportunity to review and comment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may have an Association representative present when he/she inspects<br/>his/her personnel file, or may authorize in writing an Association representative to<br/>review his/her files.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only District personnel who have direct supervisory or administrative relationships to<br/>the Unit Member may have access to the unit member’s personnel file. This section<br/>does not preclude the Superintendent from showing the files to legal counsel, or to the<br/>Board pursuant to personnel matters within their scope of responsibility.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not maintain any permanent files or data for formal evaluation other<br/>than the Unit Member’s personnel file. This section does not preclude<br/>administration/principals from maintaining temporary work files or copies of formal</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>observation reports, or final evaluations while the Unit Member remains a member of<br/>that staff.</p>
<p>5. The Unit Member may request, in writing, that derogatory material four (4) years or<br/>older be removed from the personnel file. The District may remove, separate, and seal<br/>in a separate file and retain for legal purposes.</p>
<p>J. Supervision, Support, and Informal Observations</p>
<p>This Article refers to the process of Formal Evaluation. The administrator/principal is<br/>expected to provide ongoing supervision and support of Unit Members and, therefore, this<br/>Article does not apply to informal observations. Frequent informal observations are<br/>encouraged.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XII<br/>CITIZEN COMPLAINTS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens who have specific concerns regarding a Unit Member should direct the concern<br/>verbally, or in writing, first to the Unit Member involved.

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints of a more compelling nature may be reported to a supervisor or the<br/>Superintendent, and a written complaint may be filed. If a written complaint is not filed, the<br/>Superintendent or designee will keep the information confidential, and will share it with the<br/>Unit Member in a timely manner, but not to exceed ten (10) working days. In this event, the<br/>citizen making the complaint of a more compelling nature may request anonymity.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints shall be considered confidential. Confidentiality means the information shall be<br/>limited to the Board, Superintendent, supervisor, or other Unit Members acting in an official<br/>capacity as District representative.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member shall be given a reasonable opportunity to consult with a representative<br/>and respond to the complaint before any action is taken by the supervisor or any other<br/>administrator except in cases otherwise provided for in law.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint is not resolved directly with the Unit Member, it may be appealed to the<br/>Unit Member’s supervisor, e.g., principal. If the complaint cannot be resolved verbally, it<br/>should be filed in writing with the Unit Member’s supervisor who shall provide a copy to the<br/>Unit Member.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conference shall be held between the supervisor and the Unit Member if requested in<br/>writing by the Unit Member. The complainant may be invited to attend.</p>

<p>Section I: Salaries</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVII<br/>COMPENSATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Schedule</p>
<p>The District salary schedule for the current year is attached in Appendix Section 7.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proportional Salary</p>
<p>All Unit Members who serve other than the required number of days as set forth in Article<br/>VII M (1) Work Year, shall receive pro rata salary based on the number of days worked.<br/>This provision excludes hourly summer employment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Maintenance</p>
<p>Increases in salary to each Unit Member and step advances shall depend upon that Unit<br/>Member receiving a satisfactory evaluation, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “satisfactory evaluation” is a formal evaluation conducted pursuant to Article XI of this<br/>Agreement, which concludes with the following recommendation: “satisfactory.”</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a recommendation of “satisfactory with improvement needed” the Unit<br/>Member receives his/her regular salary increase, but must receive either a “satisfactory<br/>performance” or “unsatisfactory performance” the following year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of Section C of this Article, no Unit Member shall receive an evaluation<br/>pursuant to Article XI of this Agreement with the recommendation of “unsatisfactory<br/>performance” or “satisfactory with improvement needed” unless based on the judgment<br/>of the evaluator supported by accurate, verifiable and objective evaluation data as listed<br/>in Article XI, Section B. A recommendation of “unsatisfactory performance” made<br/>pursuant to this Section for purposes of denial of salary or step increase may be<br/>appealed through the grievance procedure outlined below:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days of the Unit Member receiving the “unsatisfactory performance”</p>
<p>evaluation the Unit Member may initiate a grievance directly at Level II.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of Level II, the grievance may be continued to arbitration as<br/>specified in this Article. This step shall only be upon Association request for the<br/>purpose of denial of salary and step increase.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall be selected according to American Arbitration Association</p>
<p>procedures. The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing according to the voluntary rules<br/>of the American Arbitration Association, and shall make his/her recommendation to</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>the parties within thirty (30) calendar days of the hearing. The decision of the<br/>arbitrator, to uphold or invalidate the evaluator’s recommendation for the purpose of<br/>withholding step and salary increase shall be in writing.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not invalidate the evaluator’s recommendation unless he/she<br/>finds that:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation was conducted in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory<br/>manner;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation violated the procedures established under Article XI to such an<br/>extent to affect the final recommendation;</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion of the evaluation was not supported by enough data as described<br/>under Article XI.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision shall be final.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall assume the costs of the arbitrator’s fees and expenses and court</p>
<p>reporter costs if the arbitrator overturns its recommendation. Conversely, the<br/>Association shall assume the cost of said fees, expenses, and costs if the arbitrator<br/>upholds the District’s position. Each party shall bear the costs of advocacy.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to empower the arbitrator to make any<br/>decision amending, changing, subtracting from, or adding to the provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss in step and salary increase shall occur the ensuing school year following the<br/>receipt of an “unsatisfactory performance” recommendation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall place in escrow any step and salary increase withheld from Unit<br/>Members excluding track increases. In the event a Unit Member receives a<br/>“satisfactory” evaluation in the ensuing year, or years, the District shall remit to the Unit<br/>Member the withheld funds on or before June 30<sup>th</sup> of that school year. Interest on<br/>withheld funds shall be paid to the Unit Member. Interest shall be simple interest,<br/>computed at the rate currently being paid to the District through the Marin County Office<br/>of Education per annum, prorated.</p>
<p>If a Unit Member receives a “satisfactory with improvement needed” or an<br/>“unsatisfactory” after receiving an “unsatisfactory” in the prior year, the Unit Member’s<br/>step and salary increase for the “unsatisfactory” year, or years, shall remain in escrow<br/>until the Unit Member receives a “satisfactory” evaluation. If the Unit Member fails to<br/>receive a “satisfactory” evaluation after three (3) years, any step and salary increase(s)<br/>withheld from the first year shall be forfeited to the District on July 1<sup>st</sup> of the fourth year.<br/>This procedure shall continue until the Unit Member receives a “satisfactory” evaluation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member shall receive track increases regardless of this section. No Unit</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>Member shall be deprived of any professional right or benefit, other than those specified<br/>in number 5 above, due to the implementation of these provisions.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of these provisions shall not constitute cause nor be made part of any<br/>dismissal proceedings; however, the evaluator’s recommendations, and the supporting<br/>data can be used in dismissal or other disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should these provisions be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction and/or other<br/>governmental tribunal, the District agrees to hold the Association harmless for any and<br/>all costs, fees, and awards/judgments related to these actions. This section does not<br/>apply to suits brought by the Association or its affiliates, or to which the Association or<br/>its affiliates are moving parties.</p>
<p>Section II: Placement</p>
<p>A. Initial Placement</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall make the initial placement of new Unit Members on the salary<br/>schedule for the first year of district employment based on the number of college and<br/>university upper division credits completed beyond the completion date of the Bachelor’s<br/>Degree, and based on prior years of teaching experience. (See Salary Schedule<br/>Placement Form Appendix Section 9).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member may be given full credit for up to fifteen (15) years of full-time teaching<br/>experience if, at the time of teaching, the Unit Member possessed valid credential<br/>and/or had sole responsibility in a classroom setting. A Unit Member credited with<br/>fifteen (15) years of experience shall be placed on STEP 16 of the current salary<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time teaching, or fractional parts of a school year shall be accumulated and<br/>rounded to the nearest full year of credit. Long-term substitute teaching for continuous<br/>periods longer than twenty (20) days in the same classroom will qualify as “fractional”<br/>experience. Other substitute experience will not count, however.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transcripts, units, and verification of experience must be submitted within ten (10) days<br/>of the effective date of initial employment. Credentials must be verified before the<br/>effective date. No credit will be granted at a later date for units, degrees, or experience<br/>previously earned which are not verified at the time of employment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transcripts and verification of experience must be submitted to the District prior to a<br/>Unit Member receiving salary placement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members shall be notified within ten (10) days of receipt by the District of items<br/>described in paragraph A.3. above, of the number of credits approved by the<br/>Superintendent for the purpose of track placement, and the number of years approved<br/>for the purpose of step placement.</p>
<p>43</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments shall be pro-rated for part-time Unit Members.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member shall receive the payment effective at the beginning of the next<br/>contractual year after the degree has been granted.</p>
<p>C. Track Advancement</p>
<p>1. Units</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members planning an advancement in track for the following year must submit a<br/>request to the principal prior to June 1. (See Unit Petition Form Appendix Section<br/>11).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit will be granted only for courses pre-approved by the principal. (See<br/>paragraph 3 below.)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event credit is denied by the principal, the Unit Member may appeal to the<br/>RDTA Executive Board which may then make a recommendation to the<br/>Superintendent. The Superintendent will make the final determination.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member must present evidence of completion of course work to the District<br/>Business Office on or before September 10.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for any one course may be counted only once. The District shall record and<br/>add the completion of units to the Unit member’s personnel file. All records are<br/>available for review by Unit Members.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notification of each Unit Member’s status with regard to step, track, and number of<br/>units accumulated will be given to each Unit Member by February 28 of each school<br/>year. (See Certificated Personnel Data Form Appendix Section 10).</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One unit is equal to fifteen (15) hours of study or course work. A quarter unit shall<br/>be equivalent to 0.66 semester units.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of college or university units acceptable for salary schedule<br/>credit shall not exceed six (6) units earned during any one semester of full-time<br/>employment and ten (10) units earned during one (1) summer session.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units may not be earned for course work scheduled during unit release time.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members may earn fractional units where appropriate.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of units earned per workshop shall be based on one unit = 15 clock<br/>hours of course work.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units may be earned for non-academic activities. This provision applies for<br/>movement beyond Track C only. Up to two (2) units may be earned within a four (4)<br/>year period.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit Member shall state the number of units to be earned for the activity. The<br/>principal shall evaluate such requests on the number of hours expended, and the<br/>relevance of the activity to the Unit Member’s teaching responsibility.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petition of Units</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit Members may petition for units for Track Advancement to the principal on<br/>District-approved forms. The petition will then be forwarded to the Superintendent<br/>for final approval. (See Unit Petition Form Appendix Section 11).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credits must be from an accredited college or university or approved California<br/>institution, and must be for upper division or graduate units.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Unit Member believes that participation in a lower division course will benefit<br/>his/her professional development, and that a similar course is not available at an<br/>upper division or graduate level, then such Unit Member may petition the<br/>Superintendent for a waiver.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiver must be granted before enrollment in lower division course work.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No credit for units shall be granted unless the Unit Member has received prior<br/>approval by the principal and final approval by the Superintendent. Course approval<br/>will be granted only for those courses which extend the instructional competency of<br/>the Unit Member or which are relevant to the Unit Member’s teaching assignment in<br/>the District.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Unit Member denied prior approval for any course work will receive a form from<br/>the Superintendent stating why the petition has been denied. (See Unit Petition<br/>Form Appendix Section 11). If a petition is resubmitted to the Association Executive<br/>Board for approval, the Superintendent will then respond within thirty (30) days after<br/>receiving it from the Association.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>g. In special circumstances, credit may be granted for units completed over the<br/>summer if the Superintendent is able to issue final approval by June 30.</p>
