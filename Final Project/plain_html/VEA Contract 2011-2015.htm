<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible level, equitable solutions to the<br/>problems, which may from time to time arise affecting the welfare or working conditions of<br/>teachers as enumerated in this Agreement. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as<br/>informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any teacher having a grievance<br/>to discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member of the administration, and to have the<br/>grievance adjusted without intervention by the Association, provided that an Association<br/>representative is present and the adjustment is consistent with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits specified at<br/>each level should be considered to be maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the<br/>process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in<br/>this procedure by the end of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the<br/>following school year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein<br/>will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as<br/>soon thereafter as is practicable.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>

<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance should include the provision or provisions of this agreement alleged to<br/>have been violated. The immediate supervisor shall meet with the grievant prior to<br/>rendering a decision.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall communicate a decision to the employee in writing<br/>within ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. If the immediate supervisor does<br/>not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limits, either party may request an additional personal<br/>conference with the other party.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II</p>
<p>(a) If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant at Level I, the</p>
<p>grievant may submit a Level II grievance to the Superintendent within ten (10) days<br/>after receipt of the immediate supervisor’s written decision or lose the right to<br/>grieve.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Level II grievance should include copes of the original grievance and the<br/>immediate supervisor’s written response. The Superintendent shall meet with the<br/>grievant prior to rendering a decision. The Superintendent may request additional<br/>information if necessary.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall communicate a decision to the employee in writing within<br/>ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. If the Superintendent does not respond<br/>within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limits, either party may request an additional personal<br/>conference with the other party.</p>
<p>(3) Level III</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days of receipt of the Superintendent’s decision, the Association<br/>shall notify the District in writing of the intention to proceed to Mediation. The<br/>District will then request the services of a mediator from the California State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties shall agree upon a date for a<br/>mediation hearing.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mediator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render an advisory<br/>decision on the issue or issues submitted.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mediator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the terms of<br/>the Agreement.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing, the mediator may submit in writing to all parties, findings and<br/>recommendations.</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the mediator shall be in the form of a written recommendation to the<br/>parties.</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mediator’s recommendation is not rejected by the parties within twenty (20)<br/>days of the issuance of the recommendation, the decision of the mediator shall be<br/>deemed adopted by the Board and becomes final and binding on all parties.</p>
<p>(3) Level IV</p>

<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall undertake a review of the entire hearing records within ten (10) days<br/>of rejection by either party. At such review, oral arguments, witness examination,<br/>and/or additional evidence shall be permitted by the Superintendent/designee and the<br/>Association. Such review and arguments shall occur in closed session.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days of the Board review, the Board shall render a decision which<br/>shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Board does not render a decision within the time specified, then it shall be<br/>deemed to have adopted the decision recommended by the mediator.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>Rights of Teachers to Representation</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent/Principal or by any member<br/>or representative of the administration or the Board against any aggrieved person, any<br/>party in interest, any member of the Association, or any other participant in the grievance<br/>procedure by reason of such participation.</p>

<p>grievance meeting or hearing during the day, he/she will, upon notice to the<br/>Superintendent/Principal, be released without loss of pay in order to permit participation<br/>in the foregoing activities. Any teacher who is requested to appear in such<br/>investigations, meetings, or hearings, as a witness, shall be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance<br/>will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any<br/>of the participants.

<p>Page 25</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Paid Benefits</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mutual interests of the District and Association are to have high quality medical plans with as low an<br/>employee contribution as fiscal realities permit. Although subject to the negotiation process, the parties<br/>will endeavor to reach agreements in future years that maintain stable employee contribution levels.<br/>Effective January 1, 2008, the Board shall provide teachers a package of fully paid medical plans with a<br/>maximum combined premium cap of $7,115.</p>
<p>For the 2008-2009 school year and thereafter, the medical CAP remains unchanged. However, the District<br/>will cover the increased medical premium costs from January - June 2009 only on a one time basis.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan includes:</p>

<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefit plan year shall be from January 1 through December 31.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuance of Benefits</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are absent on account of illness and who have exhausted their accumulated paid leaves<br/>shall continue to receive the group health insurance coverage as paid for by the Board for the<br/>remainder of the school year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on other Board-approved, unpaid leaves of absence shall have the right to purchase the<br/>District insurance package, or any part, during said leave.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers retiring from the District shall have the right to purchase the District insurance package or<br/>any part thereof without regard to age, based upon insurance company approval.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Sheltered Annuities</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property Damage</p>
<p>The Board shall insure or reimburse teachers for loss, damage, or destruction of clothing or personal property<br/>suffered on district premises or on an authorized off campus trip for the District. Such reimbursement shall not</p>
<p>Page 26</p>
<p>exceed $100 per incident. If the items or items lost, damaged, or destroyed is insured, only that amount not<br/>reimbursed by insurance up to $100 shall be reimbursed by the District. Requests for reimbursement must be<br/>signed by the teacher and must include a statement that reasonable care was taken to protect the item or items<br/>from loss, damage, or destruction, and that the loss occurred while in the performance of duty.</p>
<p>5. Flexible Spending Account Plan</p>
<p>The District flexible spending account plan has been designed to meet Internal Revenue Service (IRS)<br/>guidelines as a “cafeteria plan” under Internal Revenue Code Section 125. Provisions shall be provided to all<br/>members for: (1) additional health benefits (premium conversion - including dependent coverage); (2)<br/>unreimbursed medical expenses; and (3) dependent care expenses in accordance with the terms listed below.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Fee: The district shall pay for the administrative fee charged for Option 1 (Premium<br/>Conversion Plan) and Option 2 (Medical Reimbursement Account) to a maximum fee of one-hundred<br/>dollars ($100) per employee per year. The employee shall pay the administrative fee for Option 3<br/>(Dependent Care Reimbursement Account).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may allocate up to a maximum of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for<br/>reimbursement of medical expenses inclusive of dependents.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may allocate up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) for reimbursement of<br/>dependent care expenses.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the District nor the Association provides tax advice to employees in regard to their participation in<br/>the flexible spending account plan. It is up to the individual employee to determine the level of<br/>participation up to the maximum amounts previously outlined. This benefit plan is bound by IRS<br/>guidelines.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in any of the three (3) options/accounts is an option to be decided by each employee. The<br/>amounts directed into these accounts are at the discretion of the employee and must be within the<br/>guidelines set by Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>It shall be the employee’s responsibility to participate in yearly open enrollment periods and to notify the<br/>District, with appropriate District-supplied forms, as to the exact amounts of the deductions directed<br/>toward each flexible spending account. Employees may choose to increase, decrease, or stop participation<br/>during an annual open enrollment period.</p>
<p>Flexible spending accounts may be changed only during the annual open enrollment period unless the<br/>employee has a change in family status during the year. A change in family status includes marriage,<br/>divorce, birth or adoption, death or the termination of the employee’s spouse’s employment.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an employee does not use all funds in his/her flexible spending account during the benefit year (October<br/>1 through September 30), those funds remaining in a flexible spending account must be forfeited in<br/>accordance with current tax laws. In the event that there are funds in employee’s flexible spending<br/>accounts after the end of the benefit year, those funds will be forfeited and applied toward the costs of<br/>operating the plan.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XV: ASSIGNMENT/REASSIGNMENT</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort shall be made to assign teachers within the scope of their teaching certificates and/or their<br/>major or minor fields of study. However, this provision shall not be interpreted so as to require the<br/>District to terminate the employment of a current teacher and/or employ additional teachers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy is any vacated or newly created position.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall, upon request by a teacher, notify him/her during summer recess or period of leave of<br/>any posted openings which may arise during that summer recess or period of leave. The teacher’s request<br/>must be in writing and include a mailing address for the summer or period of leave.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee applicant for a vacancy shall be selected to fill such vacancy if he/she is more qualified, as<br/>judged by training, experience and performance, than an outside applicant. In the event that an outside<br/>applicant is chosen for the position, the Superintendent, or designee, will meet with the employee<br/>applicant to discuss the reasons for selection of the outside occupant.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Reassignment</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may submit a written request for a reassignment subsequent to the posting of a vacancy pursuant<br/>to the posting procedures of this Article.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two (2) or more teachers with equal qualifications apply for a vacancy, the teacher with the greatest<br/>seniority shall receive the reassignment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee’s request for voluntary reassignment is denied, he/she shall be granted, upon request, a<br/>meeting with the administrator to discuss the reasons for the denial. The teacher may request and shall<br/>receive written reasons for the denial following the meeting. If written reasons are requested, a copy shall<br/>be filed in the employee’s personnel file, but shall not be used in any adverse personnel action that may be<br/>taken against the employee.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Reassignment</p>
<p>A. In the event that changes in such schedules, class and/or subject assignments, or room assignments are<br/>needed, the teacher affected shall normally be notified promptly in writing.</p>
<p>Page 28</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No involuntary reassignment shall be made if there is a qualified volunteer available who is acceptable to<br/>the Superintendent. When an involuntary reassignment is necessary, a teacher’s area of competence,<br/>major or minor field of study, length of service in the District, and other relevant factors shall be<br/>considered in determining which teacher is to be reassigned.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices of an involuntary reassignment for the next school year shall be given to teachers as soon as<br/>practicable and except in cases of emergency not later than May 1.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher shall not be involuntarily reassigned from a primary (K-3) position to an intermediate position<br/>(4-8) or vice versa, unless there was no other option, within the same financial expenditure, or that it is in<br/>the best interest of the educational program.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary reassignment shall be made only after a meeting between the teacher involved and the<br/>Superintendent at which time the teacher shall be notified of the reason thereof.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are reassigned during the school year shall be allowed one (1) day of release time for<br/>preparation prior to the effective date of the reassignment. The District shall provide assistance in the<br/>moving of the teacher’s material whenever he/she is reassigned.</p>
