<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For excess purposes, a unit member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assigned equal</p>
<p>numbers of classes in two or more departments,<br/>shall be considered a member of the department in<br/>which he/she is authorized by credential major to<br/>teach.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For excess purposes, a unit member assigned equal<br/>numbers of classes in two or more departments,<br/>shall be considered a member of the department in<br/>which he/she is authorized by credential minor to<br/>teach.</p>

<p>10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grades 9-12, unit members identified as excess according<br/>to Steps 1-4 above at each school may bump the most<br/>junior unit member within the District's 9-12<br/>departmentalized structure in the same category or lower as<br/>defined above in #3, prior to being reassigned to a different<br/>departmental program or transferred to an open middle<br/>school position. Unit members bumped out by this process<br/>are placed on the District's excess list.</p>

<p>25</p>
<p>individuals to be skipped over in the determination of the unit<br/>member to be declared excess. If the excess process in Section D<br/>does not produce a unit member credentialed to fill the vacant<br/>positions, then reassignment of unit members between departments<br/>may be necessary to identify a properly credentialed unit member<br/>to transfer to the vacant position. In any instance seniority will be<br/>the primary consideration.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members transferred from one school site to another school<br/>site or reassigned to a different grade/subject area after the<br/>beginning of the school year shall be provided at least three (3)<br/>days of instruction-free time to be utilized in preparation for the<br/>new assignment.</p>

It is further the intent that<br/>procedures for this program be coordinated with activities for<br/>professional staff development, the Beginning Teacher Support and<br/>Assessment Program, and the biennial evaluations of certificated<br/>employees.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State of California provides funding for the program established by<br/>this Article pursuant to Article 4.5 of the Education Code. The parties<br/>agree that the District shall not be required to provide services under this<br/>program that cost more than the funding provided by the State under<br/>Article 4.5 of the Education Code.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this article precludes the principal or District from conducting<br/>informal or formal observations, nor from fulfilling obligations<br/>regarding the evaluation process contained in Article VII of this<br/>agreement. Nothing herein shall modify the District’s right to issue<br/>notices of unsatisfactory and/or unprofessional conduct pursuant to the<br/>Education Code.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance process contained in this agreement is limited to the PAR<br/>Program and is not extended to BTSA or other staff development<br/>programs referenced in this Article, nor shall a unit member have access<br/>to the grievance process to challenge the contents of reports, evaluations</p>
<p>TUSD/TTA Agreement<br/>7/1/12- 6/30/15</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>or decisions of the Panel. However, a unit member may file responses<br/>which shall become a part of the official record of intervention or as<br/>attachments to any material placed in the personnel file.</p>
<p>E. The District shall hold harmless and indemnify the members of the PAR<br/>Panel and Consulting Teachers for any liability arising from their<br/>participation in this program.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVI</p>
<p>SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize that empowering teachers through a process<br/>which allows employees at individual schools to have increased responsibility for making<br/>decisions will improve effective professional practice and improve the educational<br/>process. Accordingly, in order to provide for the development and implementation of<br/>Site-Based Decision Making in the District, the parties agree as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary School Site Councils, Middle School Site Councils, and High</p>
<p>School Site Councils will become the focus for site-based decision</p>
<p>making.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Site Council (SSC) composition shall be as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary School - the SSC shall be constituted to ensure parity<br/>between (1) the principal, classroom teachers and other school<br/>personnel; and (2) parents or other community members.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle School - the SSC shall be constituted to ensure parity<br/>between (1) the principal, classroom teachers and other school<br/>personnel; and (2) parents and pupils.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High School - the SSC shall be constituted to ensure parity<br/>between (1) the principal, classroom teachers and other school<br/>personnel; and (2) parents and pupils.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all levels, the classroom teachers shall comprise the majority of<br/>persons represented under provision (1) in each of the above.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Site Council Election Procedures for Teacher Members</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be an annual election of teacher members to the SSC.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of the election shall be set by SSC, and it must be<br/>announced and posted two weeks prior to the date of the election.</p>
<p>TUSD/TTA Agreement<br/>7/1/12- 6/30/15</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers must declare their candidacy for SSC in writing to the<br/>TTA Building Representative or Principal at least two days prior to<br/>the date of the election.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ballots will be prepared and on Election Day will be distributed<br/>before school and must be turned in by 30 minutes after the end of<br/>the school day.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ballots will be counted by the TTA Building Representative,<br/>Principal, and SSC Chairperson and the results will be posted.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No School Site Council will be empowered to waive any provisions of this<br/>Agreement. School site councils may submit site-specific contract<br/>amendments for consideration by TTA and the District, but no proposal<br/>will be enacted unless agreed to by both parties.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of decision making for School Site Councils shall include, but<br/>not be limited to, school goals and priorities, School wide Action Plans,<br/>school discipline procedures, site staff development plans, school<br/>assessment of student learning, health/safety issues, and expenditures of<br/>categorical funds allocated by the Board of Education to that site.</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are accepted for part-time employment shall have their<br/>anniversary increments prorated as described in the above schedule.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced Services</p>

The program is offered by the District in accordance<br/>with CalSTRS guidelines regarding requirements and compensation. Reduced<br/>services unit members may be returned to full-time employment only with the<br/>mutual consent of the unit members and the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnership Teaching</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnership Teaching is defined as the sharing of one full-time assignment<br/>by two unit members both employed part-time.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than 2% of the total number of unit members at the K-12 level<br/>will be approved for partnership teaching assignments.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers entering into a Partnership Teaching assignment shall be<br/>considered to be full-time teachers entering into a partial leave of absence.<br/>As a result, they retain all rights to regain full-time employment enjoyed<br/>by any employee on a leave of absence.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVIII<br/>INTERMEDIATE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize that there may be incidents or<br/>situations involving an employee in which it is appropriate and necessary for the<br/>District to implement some form of discipline, including suspension. The District<br/>and the Association support the initial use of means short of disciplinary<br/>suspension to correct or respond to an employee’s conduct. The following<br/>procedure is intended to establish a fair process which recognizes the right of the<br/>District to appropriately discipline employees while also recognizing the right of<br/>employees to be subject to discipline only upon a showing of just cause.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive discipline may include but need not be limited to verbal warnings,<br/>written warnings and letters of reprimand. These progressive discipline measures<br/>shall not be grievable.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the provisions in this Article are not intended to be used in lieu of the<br/>evaluation procedures set forth in Article VII - Evaluation.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member retains the right to submit a written response to any action taken<br/>by the District under this Article.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this Article shall limit the District’s right to institute statutory<br/>dismissal proceedings and/or institute an immediate suspension or mandatory<br/>leave of absence in accordance with Education Code Sections 44939,44940,<br/>44942 or any other applicable Education Code provision.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article shall not confer any rights upon probationary teachers non-<br/>reelected pursuant to applicable provisions of the Education Code.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be suspended, without pay, for up to fifteen (15) days for just<br/>cause. The principles of progressive discipline shall be applicable unless the<br/>circumstances, as determined by the District, make prior warnings unnecessary.<br/>When a unit member is to be suspended without pay, the District shall adhere to<br/>the following procedure:</p>
<p>TUSD/TTA Agreement<br/>7/1/12 - 6/30/15</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall notify the unit member in writing of any proposed<br/>suspension without pay. The District will concurrently provide said notice<br/>to the Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notice shall contain a specific statement of the act(s), infraction(s), or<br/>omission(s) upon which the disciplinary action is based, the proposed<br/>length of the unpaid suspension, and a statement of any rules, regulations,<br/>or statutes the unit member is alleged to have violated.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have two (2) working days from receipt of the<br/>notice to request a meeting with the Superintendent. If the unit member<br/>does not request such a meeting, the District may schedule and impose the<br/>suspension without pay and shall provide written notice to the unit<br/>member of the imposition of the unpaid suspension. If a unit member fails<br/>to request a meeting with the Superintendent; the unit member waives the<br/>right to challenge his/her unpaid suspension through the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If requested, the unit member has the right to be represented by the<br/>Association at the meeting with the Superintendent. At the meeting with<br/>the Superintendent, the unit member shall be given the opportunity to<br/>present a response to the notice and allegations contained therein.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall inform the unit member and the Association<br/>within three (3) working days from the date of the meeting with the<br/>Superintendent as to whether or not the unit member is to be suspended<br/>without pay. For a suspension of 1-5 days, the decision of the<br/>Superintendent shall be final and binding.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is suspended without pay for 6-15 days may appeal<br/>the decision of the Superintendent by filing a grievance pursuant to Article<br/>XIX - Grievance. Any such grievance shall be initiated by Level III of the<br/>grievance procedure within three (3) working days after receipt of the<br/>decision by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Article shall in no way interfere with the right of the<br/>District to remove a unit member from the work location to which he/she is<br/>assigned, to reassign a unit member and/or place the unit member on paid leave.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid suspensions shall not reduce or deprive a unit member of health and<br/>welfare benefits.</p>

Time limits affected by the winter and spring recesses shall be<br/>extended by five (5) days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant and who has the authority to resolve the<br/>particular grievance.</p>

<p>Forms for submitting grievances shall be mutually agreed upon by the</p>
<p>Association and the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If grievants do not meet the time limits set forth in this Article, they shall<br/>lose their right to pursue the grievance procedure or be deemed to have<br/>accepted the decision at any level.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort shall be made to schedule hearings for the processing of<br/>grievances at times which shall not interfere with the regular teaching<br/>periods of the participants. If any grievance hearing must be scheduled<br/>during teaching periods, the grievant, a unit member serving as<br/>representative of the grievant, or any unit member required by either party<br/>to participate as a witness in such hearing shall be released from duty<br/>without loss of pay for participation at the hearing.</p>
<p>TUSD/TTA Agreement<br/>7/1/12- 6/30/15</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No public comments shall be made by any party involved in the grievance<br/>procedure at any level until the grievance has been resolved.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documents, communications, and/or records dealing with the processing<br/>of a grievance shall not be placed in the personnel files of any grievants or<br/>other participants in the grievance.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limits</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the District against any unit<br/>member by reason of participation in the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as limiting the right of<br/>any unit member alleging a grievance to discuss the matter informally<br/>with any appropriate District representative and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted without intervention of the Association provided the adjustment<br/>is consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Association has<br/>been given an opportunity to be present at such adjustment and to share its<br/>views. The Association shall be given an opportunity to file a written<br/>response to any proposed settlement prior to the final resolution of the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance procedure shall not be used to contest the dismissal of unit<br/>members nor the application of the requirements of EEOC, Title VI, Title<br/>VII, Title IX, unemployment insurance, or any other federal or state<br/>statute for which a specific method of review is provided by law.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues arising out of the Management Rights section of this Agreement<br/>shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance Procedure</p>

The lottery will be conducted in the presence<br/>of the affected Adult Education teachers or their representative.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Priority - Qualified probationary Adult Education teachers<br/>ranked by employment date. In the case of a tie in employment<br/>date, a lottery shall be conducted to break the tie.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third Priority - Other qualified applicants.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a need to reduce hours in Adult Education offerings, the<br/>reverse order of the assignment priority listed above shall be used<br/>provided no permanent Adult Education teacher is reduced below their<br/>level of permanency without prior consultation between the District and<br/>Association representatives.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is necessary to discontinue a class of a permanent Adult Education<br/>teacher once the assignments are made and the term begins, then the Adult<br/>Education teacher of the discontinued class is entitled to bump another<br/>less senior Adult Education teacher within the department in which the<br/>hours have been discontinued. The bumping process shall begin with the<br/>least senior Adult Education teacher and continue until at least the level of<br/>permanency of the teacher of the discontinued class has been restored,<br/>provided the teacher of the discontinued class is qualified and there is no<br/>conflict with their current Adult Education teaching assignment.</p>

All transcript verifications must be received within thirty<br/>(30) days, except when the time limit is extended by the District, of the<br/>signing of the unit members' initial contract. Failure to do so will result in<br/>the District's paying the minimum salary verified until such documents are<br/>received in the Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earned degrees received and upper division or graduate units of study<br/>earned after the bachelor's degree in an accredited institution of higher<br/>learning shall be allowed for initial placement and subsequent horizontal<br/>movement on the salary schedule. The accreditation status of a college or<br/>university at the time of the unit members' initial employment shall<br/>prevail. Credit for units earned, other than subject matter units, in a<br/>concurrent degree and credential program will be awarded for placement<br/>on the salary schedule even though the units are not earned after the<br/>issuance of the Bachelor’s Degree.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members who resign from the District and are<br/>subsequently reemployed within thirty-nine (39) months shall be placed<br/>on the step of the salary schedule to which they were entitled at the time<br/>of their resignations or at the hiring-in rate of a new employee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertical Movement</p>
<p>All unit members shall advance one vertical step on the salary schedule for each<br/>year of service except those whose placement is at the maximum step for their<br/>class. A year of service is earned upon completion of a minimum of seventy-five<br/>percent (75%) of the total days taught during the prior twelve months. Vertical<br/>movement shall be made only at the beginning of the first semester and at the<br/>beginning of the sixth school month.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horizontal Movement</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only semester or quarter units earned after receiving the bachelor's degree<br/>will be counted. Course credit for salary placement and movement shall<br/>be given only for lower division (with prior approval; see Sections 6 and 7<br/>below) and upper division or graduate course work taken at two-year<br/>and/or four-year colleges, universities, or graduate schools which are<br/>accredited by a regional accrediting commission.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semester hours (units) as defined by the particular accredited college or<br/>university will be acceptable for placement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>Quarter hours (units) shall be converted to semester hours (units) by<br/>multiplying the total of such hours (units) by two-thirds (2/3).</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements for column change, including the District's application<br/>form, must be completed prior to the end of the first week of paid service<br/>of the new school year and prior to February 10 to be effective at the<br/>beginning of the sixth school month. If, by the end of the first week of the<br/>new school year or February 10, the unit member is unable to submit<br/>supporting records or transcripts verifying necessary units of study which<br/>are to apply toward reclassification, official notices in the form of a grade<br/>card or letter from the college or institution shall be submitted. Such<br/>temporary verifications which indicate satisfactory completion of the<br/>course(s) shall be sufficient evidence to meet the above requirements.<br/>However, unit members shall provide the official transcript or affidavit<br/>document to the District as soon as it is available but not later than<br/>December 1 for reclassification effective at the beginning of the school<br/>year and April 1 for reclassification effective the sixth school month.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleven- and twelve-calendar-month certificated employees in the<br/>bargaining unit are required to apply for and complete column change<br/>requirements prior to July 1 or prior to February 1.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of proof of training, experience, possession of credentials, and<br/>other required documents shall lie with unit members, both for initial<br/>placement and for subsequent reclassification. Any error in classification<br/>shall be corrected as soon as the error is verified. Audit courses will not<br/>be accepted as training credits valid for salary schedule placement or<br/>reclassification. Credit will not be accepted for course work taken in the<br/>armed services, except as it was taken in conjunction with an accredited<br/>college or university and can be verified through official transcripts. To<br/>receive credit for course work taken through a foreign university or other<br/>institution which sponsors courses for credit, credit must be assigned<br/>upper division or graduate status and be given unit value. Such foreign<br/>university or other institution must be listed in the current edition of<br/>accredited institutions of higher learning or one of its regional accrediting<br/>commissions.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If unit members believe that participation in a lower division course, or a<br/>continuing education course, taken at two-year and/or four-year colleges,<br/>universities, or graduate schools which are accredited by a regional<br/>accrediting commission will be of direct benefit to the District and that a<br/>similar benefit is not available at an upper division or graduate course<br/>level, aforementioned unit members may petition the District for waivers.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such waivers, if granted, would allow the units so approved to be counted<br/>for advancement on the salary schedule. Prior to the date of enrollment in<br/>a lower division course(s), unit members must make formal application to</p>
<p>TUSD/TTA Agreement<br/>7/1/12 - 6/30/15</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>the District and receive approval in the form of the aforementioned<br/>waivers.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be paid on a calendar-month basis. Unit members shall<br/>receive an earned salary advance of approximately one-half (1/2) of the first<br/>month's service on the 20<sup>th</sup> of the month and the remainder of the salary shall be<br/>paid after the conclusion of the school month on the 5<sup>th</sup> of the following month.<br/>Actual payday schedules shall be distributed to unit members in accordance with<br/>pay schedule approved by the Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anniversary Increments</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anniversary increments as indicated on the salary schedules shall be<br/>granted to unit members meeting the requirements of Columns 4, 5, and 6<br/>in accordance with the provisions of the salary schedule.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service as part-time regular District certificated unit members shall accrue<br/>eligibility for anniversary step increments on a prorata basis. Each<br/>individual year of such part-time employment shall be computed by<br/>converting the salary paid to a percent of the salary which full-time unit<br/>members in the same class and step would have been paid.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall receive a stipend each year for an earned Ed.D. or Ph.D. from<br/>an accredited institution. Such stipend shall be increased with the annual salary<br/>increase percentage. Unit members shall receive the same stipend and placement<br/>on the last column of the salary schedule for an earned J.D. or D.D.S. from an<br/>accredited institution when it is determined by the District that the degree has<br/>relevance to the unit member’s current assignment.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District creates any new classifications within the bargaining unit during the<br/>term of the Agreement, it shall determine and establish the salary rate and rules<br/>applicable thereto in an equitable manner for the balance of the term of the<br/>Agreement. It shall notify the Association of any such action.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are authorized to work more than 185 days shall be paid their<br/>daily rate of pay in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching<br/>Standards (NBPTS) will receive an annual stipend of $1,000, or may use the<br/>National Board Certification in lieu of a master’s degree for placement in Column<br/>5 (only) of the salary schedule.</p>
