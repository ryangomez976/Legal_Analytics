<p>ARTICLE 19 - Hours and Adjunct Duties</p>
<p>19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of Workday / Work Year</p>
<p>The school year will consist of 180 student-instructional days and three (3) non-<br/>instructional work days for a total of 183 duty days. It is the intent of the District to<br/>keep the student instructional year intact. Any potential changes to this schedule would<br/>be part of a Memorandum of Understanding accompanying this contract.</p>
<p>Certificated employees will receive a full year of service credit for<br/>STRS. Should any additional monies become available, the district agrees to meet to<br/>discuss reinstatement of the certificated furlough days as its first priority prior to<br/>additional monies being allocated.</p>
<p>19.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that the varying nature of a unit member’s day-to-<br/>day professional responsibilities does not lend itself totally to an instructional day of<br/>rigidly established length. The minimum school day assignment for all teachers will be<br/>a 7 1/2 hour duty day, including a minimum thirty (30) minute duty free lunch period.</p>
<p>19.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members must report to their duty at least fifteen (15) minutes<br/>before instruction begins and they may leave no earlier than fifteen (15) minutes after</p>
<p>the regular student day, provided they complete the same established minimum duty<br/>time and their daily schedule is consistent on a daily basis.</p>

<p>19.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any regularly scheduled services by a unit member beyond contractually<br/>specified time, which involves non-classroom supervision of pupils, shall be on a<br/>voluntary basis or paid per stipend schedule. (See contract article 23.4)</p>
<p>19.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For stipend requests not specifically outlined in contract, the District and<br/>Association will meet collaboratively on an as-needed basis with the requesting site<br/>leader(s) to discuss the relative value of the work requested and to make a<br/>determination as to how the addition of the new work will impact the total stipend<br/>allotment.</p>
<p>19.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Time</p>
<p>19.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall utilize the remainder of the regular workday for faculty<br/>meetings, in-service meetings, IEP team meetings, meetings with parents and/or staff<br/>members, and/or planning and preparation for their assignment The establishment of<br/>such days may require that there be some adjustment in other duty days to assure that<br/>minimum instructional minutes are provided at all times as defined in the California<br/>Education Code. Teachers receive preparation time either as part of weekly early<br/>release days, or as a preparation period during the instructional day. This preparation<br/>period is part of the teacher workday, and although considered non-instructional time,</p>
<p>it is not duty-free time. As such, the preparation period may only be used for<br/>instructional or other work-related preparation. Unit members may not use their<br/>preparation period for outside work or for personal business. Unit members who agree<br/>to teach during their preparation period for a full school year will be compensated an<br/>additional one-eighth (1/8) of their regular salary.</p>
<p>19.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event coverage is needed for a bargaining unit member for any<br/>period of time less than one-half of the contract day (for example, an absence of one<br/>instructional period is needed to attend a sports event or a doctor's appointment),<br/>another bargaining unit member who has prep time during the absence may, with the<br/>approval of the site administrator, cover the absence in lieu of his/her prep time for that<br/>day, and receive a stipend from the District at the rate of $25.00 per hour. Should the<br/>absence be subject to the language in Article 21: Leaves, the appropriate dock shall<br/>be made the to bargaining unit member’s accrual.</p>
<p>19.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation on Committees</p>
<p>19.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members’ participation on all District committees shall be on a voluntary<br/>basis and they may be granted release time during their workday at no loss of pay or<br/>benefits to fulfill the obligations of their appointment.</p>

If leave is taken for the birth,<br/>adoption, or placement of a child for foster care, an employee may<br/>take such leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule on<br/>two occasions without regard to the duration of such leave. The<br/>third and all subsequent occasions must be for a minimum of two<br/>consecutive weeks duration.

<p>APPENDIX B: District Complaint Procedure</p>
<p>Dear Parent / Community Member:</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees understands that the attached complaint procedure can be<br/>complex and time consuming if taken to level five. Your patience and effort will help to<br/>assure that the District protects the rights of individuals and follows due process<br/>reguirements.</p>
<p>Written accounts of complaints are necessary to eliminate ambiguity and assure that<br/>documentation exists to provide a clear and complete account of concerns and<br/>events. Your efforts will offer the administration and school board the facts needed to<br/>make fair and impartial decision should the complaint advance to higher levels.</p>
<p>It is the Board’s goal that concerns be resolved at the earliest level so that community<br/>members and employees can mutually agree to a plan that will improve the<br/>educational program. We are confident that in most cases this procedure will provide<br/>a fair and just resolution of differences.</p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to call the district office if you have any questions or need<br/>assistance with any part of the process.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your School Board<br/>Chawanakee Unified School District</p>
<p>COMPLAINT PROCEDURE</p>
<p>LEVEL 1 - INFORMAL DISCUSSION</p>
<p>The first step in the complaint procedure shall be an informal discussion between the<br/>parties in order to resolve the issue. For example, in the case of a parent/guardian<br/>with a complaint about his/her child’s teacher, the first step would require the<br/>parent/guardian to informally discuss the issue with the teacher. Complaints made<br/>directly to the principal or supervisor shall be referred to the employee. If a private<br/>informal conference is unacceptable to the grievant or employee, the employee’s<br/>principal or supervisor shall offer to attend the informal conference.</p>
<p>LEVEL 2 - WRITTEN STATEMENT</p>
<p>If the informal discussion did not resolve the issue, the grievant shall within ten (10)<br/>working days prepare a written statement of the complaint and submit it to the<br/>appropriate employee. The written statement shall include a clear, concise account of<br/>the complaint; the persons involved, and the name and address of the grievant. Within<br/>five (5) working days the employee will add his/her written response to the statement</p>
<p>and conduct a conference with the grievant to review the complaint and<br/>response. Failure of the grievant to submit a written statement shall be considered a<br/>dropping of the complaint.</p>
<p>LEVEL 3 - SITE ADMINISTRATOR / SUPERVISOR</p>
<p>If the grievant remains dissatisfied following the discussion and review at Level 2,<br/>he/she may submit within ten (10) working days following the completion of Level 2, a<br/>written grievance to the site administrator or supervisor. The written grievance shall<br/>include a copy of the Level 2 written complaint; the persons involved, and the name<br/>and address of the grievant. The site administrator or supervisor shall notify the<br/>employee of the advancement to Level 3 within the ten (10) day period. The site<br/>administrator or supervisor shall submit a written response to the grievant within ten<br/>(10) working days of receiving the Level 3 notice.</p>
<p>LEVEL 4 - DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION</p>
<p>If the grievant remains dissatisfied following the site administrator/supervisor response<br/>at Level 3, he/she may submit the complaint within seven (7) working days of receiving<br/>the response to the district superintendent or designee for review. The request for<br/>review shall include a copy of the Level 2 written complaint; the employee’s and site<br/>administrator/supervisor written responses; the actions previously taken; the persons<br/>involved; and the name and address of the grievant.</p>
<p>The grievant shall submit the complaint directly to the superintendent or designee who<br/>may hold a conference with all interested parties to the complaint within five (5)<br/>working days of the complaint’s receipt unless there is mutual agreement that more<br/>time is needed. The superintendent shall submit a written response to the grievant of<br/>the decision in the matter within five (5) working days after the conclusion of the<br/>conference or ten (10) working days after receipt of the complaint, whichever comes<br/>first.</p>
<p>LEVEL 5 - BOARD OF TRUSTEES</p>
<p>If the grievant remains dissatisfied following the decision at Level 4, he/she may<br/>submit a letter within seven (7) working days after the receipt from Level 4, requesting<br/>a review of the decision by the Board of Trustees. The written request shall include a<br/>copy of the Level 2 written complaint; the reason(s) why the grievant has not been<br/>satisfied at the lower levels of the process; the actions previously taken; the persons<br/>involved; and the name and address of the grievant. The Board of Trustees shall<br/>place the review of the decision on the next regularly scheduled agenda if the request<br/>is received within seven (7) days following the grievant’s receipt of the decision from<br/>Level 4. The Board shall review the decision and the complaint and shall render its<br/>final decision during the board meeting.</p>
