<p>ARTICLE XVII: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRIEVANCE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROCEDURE</p>
<p>17.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</p>
<p>17.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;grievance&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claim by the Association or by one or more teachers</p>
<p>that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of a<br/>provision of this Agreement, or a violation, misapplication, or<br/>misinterpretation of any law. Board policy,or regulation.</p>
<p>17.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;grievant&quot; is the unit member, unit members, or the Association<br/>making the claim.</p>
<p>17.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;party&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interest&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is any person who might be required to take action or</p>
<p>against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>17.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;day&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day in which the grievant is required by contract to</p>
<p>render service.</p>
<p>17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to the problems which may from time to time arise affecting the<br/>welfare or working conditions of unit members and the Association. Both parties agree<br/>that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at<br/>any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>17.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggrieved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall normally seek a solution to his/her problem</p>
<p>through at least one informal discussion with his/her immediate supervisor<br/>prior to initiating a formalized grievance proceeding as hereinafter<br/>described. Adjustment of a grievance through such an informal discussion<br/>may be accomplished without the intervention of the Association.<br/>However, the aggrieved person may, at his/her discretion, be represented<br/>by the Association in any such informal discussion.</p>

<p>2014-2015</p>
<p>17.3</p>
<p>17.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible,</p>
<p>the time limits specified at each level should be considered to be<br/>maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The<br/>time limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement of grievant<br/>and District representative.</p>
<p>17.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year, and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school<br/>year could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth<br/>herein, may be, by mutual consent, reduced so that the procedure may be<br/>exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>Formal Procedure</p>

The selection of the arbitrator and<br/>the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the<br/>Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American<br/>Arbitration Association for services rendered.</p>
<p>17.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall set<br/>forth the findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions of the<br/>issues submitted.

<p>21.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Program, hereafter referred to as<br/>&quot;Program&quot;, for all teachers. The PAR Program provides a mechanism whereby<br/>exemplary teachers assist other teachers in the areas of subject matter knowledge,<br/>teaching methodology, and teaching strategies. The Program shall have three<br/>components:</p>
<p>21.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pennanent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher Peer Assistance Program: This component shall</p>
<p>provide peer assistance to permanent teachers who receive an<br/>&quot;unsatisfactory&quot; evaluation in the area of teaching methods or instruction.</p>
<p>21.1.1.1 Teachers receiving an &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; evaluation in the</p>
<p>area of teaching methodology and/or instruction will be<br/>referred to the PAR Program by the principal or designated<br/>evaluator for assistance under this Program.</p>

<p>21.4 Permanent Teacher Peer Assistance Program</p>
<p>21.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Program is to provide assistance and renew quality</p>
<p>teaching and offer remediation to permanent teachers whose performance<br/>has been evaluated as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in either or both teaching methods</p>

<p>21.4.6</p>
<p>and instruction by the principal or designated evaluator. In addition, it<br/>shall be the obligation of the Panel to report the results of this intervention<br/>to the Board of Education of the District.</p>
<p>This Program shall be limited to addressing those areas of performance set<br/>forth in the evaluation document listed as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; encompassed in<br/>the areas of subject matter knowledge, teaching strategies, or both.<br/>Assistance provided by the peer coach shall focus on the specific areas<br/>recommended for improvement by the participating teacher's evaluator<br/>based upon the unsatisfactory rating or ratings in the performance<br/>evaluation that resulted in the referral to the PAR Program.</p>
<p>Assistance and remedial efforts and activities shall be intense and<br/>multifaceted, and shall be preceded by a conference in the spring of the<br/>year when the teacher receives the &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; evaluation. The<br/>conference shall involve the teacher being referred, the evaluator who<br/>evaluated the teacher, and coach, to begin the development of an<br/>Individual Learning Plan. If the permanent teacher so desires, the<br/>Association shall provide representation in this meeting.</p>
<p>The assistance shall be provided by peer coaches under this Article and<br/>shall be closely monitored by the PAR Panel.</p>
<p>The course of assistance shall include one or more of the following:</p>
<p>21.4.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple classroom observations by the peer coach;</p>
<p>21.4.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance specific to the area of teaching methodology or<br/>instruction which has been evaluated to be &quot;unsatisfactory”<br/>or other areas deemed in need of assistance by the peer<br/>coach during the period of assistance.</p>
<p>21.4.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for the teacher receiving assistance to<br/>observe exemplary practice, either by the peer coach or<br/>other exemplary teachers.</p>
<p>21.4.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-provided professional development opportunities;</p>
<p>21.4.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference attendance, often in the company of the peer<br/>coach, to facilitate reflection on how this experience fits<br/>into the Individual Learning Plan;</p>

<p>21.4.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties understand that every possible subject matter<br/>competency may not be available within the corps of<br/>coaches, and therefore, it shall occasionally be necessary to<br/>secure additional assistance to fully address identified<br/>deficiencies. In such cases, the peer coach shall maintain<br/>prime responsibility for the Individual Learning Plan, but<br/>may function more like a case carrier who assures the<br/>availability of appropriate resources.</p>
<p>Communication and consultation with the principal/evaluator shall be<br/>ongoing.</p>
<p>Nothing in this article precludes the principal/evaluator or District from<br/>doing informal observations nor from notifying the teacher verbally and/or<br/>in writing regarding incidents or events related to the teacher's fulfillment<br/>of his or her professional obligations.</p>
<p>Written peer review reports will be submitted to the Panel by the Peer<br/>Coach at every meeting. The coach will share all written and verbal<br/>evaluation reports during a conference with the teacher, prior to<br/>submission to the Panel. A copy of the written reports will be provided to<br/>the principal/evaluator.</p>
<p>The peer coach shall submit an oral and written final report regarding the<br/>teacher's participation in PAR to the Panel no later than June. This report<br/>shall describe the measures of assistance provided to the teacher and<br/>describe the results of the assistance in the area or areas recommended for<br/>improvement. The final report shall become a part of the permanent<br/>teacher's personnel file. The teacher shall have the opportunity to attach<br/>his or her comments.</p>
<p>21.4.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and principal/evaluator may be present for the<br/>coach's presentation and will be given an opportunity to<br/>respond to the report.</p>
<p>The Panel shall deliberate whether:</p>
