<p>Grievance/Complaint Procedures</p>
<p>6.1 Purpose: The purpose of the grievance/complaint procedure is to secure, at the lowest<br/>possible administrative or supervisory level, proper and equitable solutions to<br/>grievance/complaint, and to guarantee orderly succession of procedures within which<br/>solutions may be pursued. All District personnel are encouraged to follow these procedures<br/>to settle their grievances/complaints; school personnel are encouraged to ask their immediate<br/>supervisor or the Association for assistance on any matters that relate to their duties. The<br/>intent of this procedure is to settle grievances/complaints, whenever possible, within the<br/>district staff. However, participants shall not be limited to district employees if there is a<br/>desire or need for advice or assistance from representatives of the Association. Within this<br/>general frame-work, the following specific purposes are to be served by the<br/>grievance/complaint procedures:</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that a grievance/complaint is considered fairly, with all due speed and<br/>without prejudice or reprisal to the aggrieved employee.</p>
<p>6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage certificated employee expression regarding conditions that affect<br/>him/her professionally.</p>
<p>6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a specific procedure which will facilitate the understanding of district<br/>policies which affect certificated employees.</p>
<p>6.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build confidence in the sincerity and integrity of the procedure as a means to<br/>establish the facts upon which a grievance/complaint is based and come to fair</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>conclusions.</p>
<p>6.2 Definition of Terms:</p>

<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint - A complaint is an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication<br/>of established policy and/or administrative regulation. (Complaints shall not be<br/>subject to arbitration. The final resolution shall be Level IV.)</p>
<p>6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conferee - An Association member.</p>
<p>6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated Employee - Any employee within the bargaining unit. The term<br/>&quot;certificated employee&quot; may include a group of employees within the bargaining unit<br/>who are similarly affected by a grievance/complaint.</p>

The aggrieved employee or the Association<br/>and the immediate supervisor should make every effort to resolve the difficulty within<br/>fifteen (15) days from the initial statement of the grievance/complaint. Each party<br/>should state his/her position clearly and the</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>background reasons for the grievance/complaint should be explored. At least one<br/>personal conference between the employee or the Association and the immediate<br/>supervisor should occur. Additional conferences should be held prior to Level Two if<br/>it appears that resolution of the grievance/complaint may be achieved by informal<br/>means.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after the informal conference between the immediate supervisor and the employee<br/>or the Association, the employee initiating the grievance/complaint is not satisfied<br/>with the disposition of the matter, or if the employee feels his/her relationship with<br/>the immediate supervisor or the nature of the grievance/complaint is such that s/he<br/>cannot reasonably discuss the matter with him/her, s/he shall have the right to have a<br/>conferee serve as his/her advocate.</p>
<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved finds it necessary, s/he may proceed directly to Level Two of the</p>
<p>grievance/complaint procedure.</p>
<p>6.4 Level Two - Formal Conference With Immediate Supervisor</p>

This written formal grievance/complaint must be filed (actually received<br/>by the District) within forty-five (45) days of the date the aggrieved employee(s)<br/>knew or should reasonably have known of the facts and circumstances giving rise to<br/>the grievance. Level One, if used by the aggrieved employee(s), must also be filed<br/>within this forty-five (45) day period. The following information will be included in<br/>the formal grievance/complaint:</p>

When<br/>either party wishes to bring in a conferee, notification of the identity of the conferee<br/>shall be given at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the time the formal<br/>conference is to be held.</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor receiving the grievance/complaint shall communicate the<br/>decision to the aggrieved employee in writing five (5) days after the conference.</p>

<p>The appeal to the Superintendent must be filed within five (5) days after receiving the<br/>Level Two decision. A copy of the appeal shall be sent to the persons who rendered<br/>previous decisions.</p>
<p>6.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal shall be in writing and shall include a copy of the grievance/complaint<br/>form previously submitted.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>6.5.3 The Superintendent has within fifteen (15) days of receiving the appeal to schedule a</p>
<p>meeting. After that meeting, s/he shall render a written decision or refer the appeal<br/>directly to the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>6.6 Level Four - Appeal To The Board Of Trustees</p>
<p>6.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggrieved employee may appeal to the Board of Trustees within five (5) days<br/>from the receipt of the decision of the Superintendent. Documents related to the<br/>appeal shall be submitted to the Board of Trustees at least five (5) days prior to the<br/>next regularly-scheduled Board meeting. At that regularly-scheduled Board meeting<br/>the employee shall have the opportunity to speak to the Board of Trustees in a closed<br/>session regarding the appeal. The Board of Trustees will render a decision by the next<br/>regularly-scheduled Board meeting, if possible, utilizing other special meetings as<br/>necessary. The President of the Board of Trustees shall communicate, in writing, the<br/>decision and rationale of the Board of Trustees within five (5) days following that<br/>regularly-scheduled Board meeting to the grievant and the Association.</p>
<p>6.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Board of Trustees regarding complaints shall be final.</p>
<p>6.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic right of either party to pursue a grievance/complaint through the courts<br/>shall not be denied or abridged by this grievance/complaint procedure after the<br/>process has been exhausted.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>6.7 Arbitration</p>
<p>6.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved is not satisfied with the decision at Level Four, s/he may notify the<br/>Association of his/her wish to have the Association carry the grievance to binding<br/>arbitration. The Association shall notify the Superintendent within fifteen (15) days<br/>of its decision to carry the grievance to arbitration. The aggrieved and/or the<br/>Association and the Board shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement<br/>can be reached, within five (5) days, the Association shall request from the State<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service (SMCS) a panel of five names of persons from<br/>the Northern Region experienced in hearing grievances in public schools. Each party<br/>shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The remaining panel<br/>member shall be the binding arbitrator.

<p>ARTICLE XV</p>
<p>Wages, Health, and Welfare</p>
<p>15.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-2014&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary schedules (and related rates and stipends as currently</p>
<p>provided by this Agreement and past practice) shall be increased by 3% effective with the<br/>February 2014 pay warrant.</p>
<p>15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health and Welfare Benefits</p>
<p>Beginning February, 2014, District and employee contributions toward health and welfare<br/>benefits (medical and dental insurance) shall be as set forth below in this article.</p>
<p>15.2.1 The District and each unit member shall share equally the increased premium costs of<br/>health and welfare benefits (medical and dental) for themselves and their families as<br/>compared to the 2012-2013 premium costs for the following carriers and coverage: MetLife<br/>Dental Insurance (Prepaid), Group #KM05753753; Delta Dental [with Adult Orthodontia<br/>($2000) and Child Orthodontia ($2000)], Group #2573; Blue Shield PPO (Medical -<br/>$1000/$2000 with 100% hospitalization). Policy #931128-PPO Group Benefits; and Kaiser<br/>(Medical), Group SI, Group Policy #992.</p>
<p>15.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective with the February 2014 pay warrant, unit members shall contribute<br/>prospectively, through automatic payroll deduction, this fifty percent (50%)<br/>share (specifically, for approximately one-half of the 2013-2014 school year).</p>
<p>15.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing “50/50” cost sharing shal 1 conti nue through the2015-2016<br/>school year (i.e., comparing 2014-2015 to 2013-2014, and 2015-2016 to 2014-<br/>2015). The increased employee contribution for each year, beginning with<br/>2013-2014, shall be cumulative. If the monthly premium cost for benefits</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>decreases compared to the prior year, the unit member’s payroll deduction<br/>amount will be reduced or eliminated to reflect that reduction.</p>
<p>15.2.1.3</p>
<p>15.2.1.4</p>
<p>15.2.1.5</p>
<p>As of the expiration of this Agreement in 2015-2016, the ratio of the District’s<br/>and employee’s share beginning prospectively in 2016-2017 shall be adjusted<br/>by the percentage savings/reductions in premium rates over the term of the<br/>Agreement through the HBC opinions and findings according to the Sideletter<br/>and negotiations process already agreed to. The parties agree to promote<br/>wellness programs in their effort to reduce and contain premium costs. The<br/>amount of employee and District contributions previously arrived at under the<br/>50/50 ratio method will remain in effect.</p>
<p>By way of example only, if during the term of this Agreement premium rates<br/>are reduced 15% below what they would have been absent plan design or<br/>carrier changes, the adjusted ratio for District/unit member premium rate<br/>increases effective 2016-2017 would be 65%/35% respectively. The specific<br/>calculation for adjustment of this ratio shall be according to section 15.2.1.6.<br/>The adjusted ratio of the District’s and employee’s share beginning in 2016-<br/>2017 (plus the amount of employee and District contributions previously<br/>arrived at under the 50/50 ratio method) shall be the status quo unless and<br/>until negotiated otherwise by the parties.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the foregoing calculations shall be based on an agreed<br/>upon method for calculating the cost of benefits per participating Full Time<br/>Equivalent (FTE) annually, beginning February 2014. This shall include a<br/>method that takes the following into account:</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>15.2.1.5.1 The population of each plan and number of participating FTE as of the<br/>close of the open enrollment period on May 31 each year.</p>
<p>15.2.</p>
<p>15.2.1.6</p>
<p>15.2.1.7</p>
<p>15.2.1.8</p>
<p>.5.2 Calculation of a single, average health cost per FTE, based on premium<br/>costs for, and population of unit members in all medical and dental plans.<br/>This average health cost per FTE shall be used to determine a uniform<br/>payroll deduction amount as well as the overall premium savings from<br/>year to year.</p>
<p>An example of the foregoing calculations implementing the foregoing “50/50”<br/>cost sharing plan, including an adjustment to this ratio beginning in 20lb-<br/>2017, is attached as Appendix C and incorporated into this Agreement. The<br/>parties agree that Appendix C expresses their mutual intent as to the meaning<br/>and intended implementation of this Article. Any inconsistencies that might<br/>arise between Appendix C and the language in this Article shall be resolved in<br/>favor of Appendix C.</p>
<p>The District may convert current health and welfare benefit plans to “tiered<br/>rates.” The parties agree, however, that these rates shall be converted to<br/>composite rates, by health plan, for bargaining unit members. These rates shall<br/>be used in calculating the average health cost per FTE provided in section</p>
<p>15.1.2.5.2 above.</p>
<p>The District will provide the Health Benefit Committee (HBC) (and ETA<br/>upon request) all records and data utilized to make the calculations in this</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>Article.</p>
<p>15.2.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District receives a rebate in health and welfare costs, the subj ect of<br/>allocation of these funds shall be referred to the HBC for opinions and<br/>findings according to the Sideletter and negotiations process already agreed<br/>to.</p>
<p>15.2.1.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any disagreements regarding application of sections 15.2 through and<br/>including 15.2.1.7, and section 15.2.4.2, shall be subject to Article VI<br/>(Grievance/Complaint Procedures), provided that the Arbitration step (section<br/>6.7) is hereby modified to provide for a three person panel comprised of one<br/>appointee each by the District and Association, and a neutral selected by these<br/>two appointees. The two appointees shall utilize the State Mediation and<br/>Conciliation Service (SMCS) selection procedure in Article VI if they can not<br/>agree on a neutral.</p>
<p>15.2.2 The District contribution per unit member per month to the Evergreen Teachers</p>
<p>Association Health and Welfare Trust shall be effective September 1 of each school</p>
<p>year provided below:</p>
<p>School Year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contribution/Member/Month</p>

<p>2014- 2015&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$128.50</p>
<p>The 2014-2015 contribution amount set forth above shall remain in effect until and</p>
<p>unless negotiated otherwise by the parties.</p>
<p>15.2.2.1 Evergreen Teachers Association Health and Welfare Trust</p>
<p>The payment of the negotiated contributions shall be made to the authorized<br/>agent for the Health and Welfare Trust. The Evergreen Teachers Association</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>Health and Welfare Trust, on behalf of its participants who are retired<br/>employees of the District and who are eligible for Trust benefits, shall be<br/>allowed to secure health coverage for its participants through the current<br/>District Plans. The Trust will meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain the tax exempt qualification from the IRS and the<br/>California Franchise Tax Board;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare and file all necessary documents in a timely fashion;</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trust will send copies to the District of any and all<br/>documents filed with any public agency upon request from the<br/>District;</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trust will comply with all applicable state and federal laws<br/>and regulations and file all legally required reports</p>
<p>and other documents with the responsible state and federal<br/>agencies, as are now or may hereafter be required;</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request from the District, the Trust shall send copies of<br/>any and all filings required by federal or state law to the<br/>District, and the Trust's counsel will confirm to the District in<br/>writing that the foregoing conditions continue to be complied<br/>with. It is expressly agreed and understood that the<br/>Association will indemnify and hold the District harmless from<br/>and against any and all liability of whatever kind of character<br/>arising from or out of the creation or administration of the trust<br/>described herein, so long as the District makes the</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>contributions called for herein to the Trust on a monthly basis<br/>and in a timely fashion. It is recognized that the District shall<br/>have no trustees on the Trust and shall not be involved in<br/>administering the Trust. Therefore, the Association will<br/>indemnify and hold the District harmless from and against any<br/>liability arising from a breach of any fiduciary duty committed<br/>by or charged against any fiduciary of the Trust and/or any<br/>liability arising as a result of a violation of any state or federal<br/>law, regulation or ruling by the Trust, or any fiduciary or<br/>administrator of the Trust. While it is not contemplated that<br/>there will be any type of benefits funded by this trust that<br/>would be monitored by the Pension Benefit Guarantee<br/>Corporation, or that could create any &quot;unfunded liability,&quot; as<br/>that term has been defined for purposes of federal and state<br/>law, the Association will indemnify and hold the District<br/>harmless from and against any liability that exists or comes<br/>into being as a result of unfunded liability or noncompliance<br/>with any rules or regulations promulgated by the Pension<br/>Benefit Guarantee Corporation. In the event that the District is<br/>named a party in any disputes arising in connection with the<br/>interpretation, administration, or enforcement of the terms of<br/>the Trust, or in connection with the enforcement or<br/>administration of any state or federal law or regulation relating<br/>to the Trust, the Association agrees to indemnify the District</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>representation in such a dispute, including reasonable<br/>attorney's fees. The District agrees that the attorney that<br/>represents the Association and/or Trust and trustees in such a<br/>dispute shall also represent the District, unless an actual<br/>conflict of interest is demonstrated. If the District desires to<br/>obtain its own counsel in disputes where no actual conflict of<br/>interest with the Association and/or Trust is demonstrated, the<br/>District shall be responsible for its own reasonable attorney's<br/>fees. It is further expressly recognized and agreed by and<br/>between the parties hereto that this trust is being solely<br/>established by the Association, and the trustees so appointed<br/>will be solely liable for the Trust's administration and debts,<br/>and that the District is not a fiduciary of the trust, or of any<br/>participant or beneficiary of the Trust. The District's sole<br/>obligation to the Association, to the Trust and to its participants<br/>and beneficiaries shall be to make the contributions called for<br/>herein.</p>
