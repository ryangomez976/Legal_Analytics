<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurses may be assigned by the Superintendent to work up to one hundred ninety two<br/>(192) days per school year. The additional days of work will be paid at the per diem<br/>rate which is based upon the unit member’s placement on the salary scheduled divided<br/>by one hundred eighty-two (182).</p>

Unit members who are required to participate in<br/>such inservice training shall receive extra pay at the hourly rate established in Article<br/>XV, Salary Schedules.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possible Extension to the Work Year- Effective July 1, 2005</p>
<p>1. Three additional workdays for staff development, pursuant to the AB 825<br/>(Chapter 871/2004) categorical Block Grant for Professional Development<br/>(Resource Accounting code 7393), shall be added to the certificated work<br/>calendar commencing in 2005-06 for a total of one hundred eighty-five (185)<br/>required workdays. Bargaining unit members shall receive per diem pay for<br/>each of the additional days. Per diem pay shall be calculated as the amount<br/>paid to a bargaining unit member based on his/her proper placement of the<br/>Certificated Salary Schedule divided by one hundred eighty-three.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>These three additional workdays are contingent upon receipt of state<br/>Professional Development Block Grant funding which is sufficient to cover the<br/>costs of the additional days. In future years, if it is determined that there will not<br/>be sufficient funding from the Block Grant to pay the complete cost for these<br/>days, the parties agree to immediately open this provision to additional<br/>negotiation in an effort to maintain these days. The District retains the right to<br/>unilaterally deduct the three days from the required workdays at the beginning of<br/>the next school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2005-2006 school year, the District and the Association agree that<br/>flexibility within the six new block grants authorized under AB 825 shall not be<br/>applied for the purpose of transferring funds to the General Fund for the purpose<br/>of making funds available for salary and/or benefit increases. The parties agree<br/>that any future substantive changes to the funding matrix will trigger a reopening<br/>of this provision.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This additional workday is contingent upon receipt of state incentive funding for<br/>staff development which is sufficient to cover the costs of the additional day. In<br/>future years, if there is not sufficient funding for this day, it shall be automatically<br/>deducted from the work year at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants are responsible for completing and submitting records of attendance<br/>including sign-in/sign-out sheets, timesheets for payroll purposes and other<br/>records as needed for audit purposes.</p>
<p>I. Professional Development Day Scheduling</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three days of professional development in Section H. of this article will be<br/>scheduled on the work year calendar.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the approval of the District, one or more of the days of staff development<br/>may be scheduled by an individual school to take place before or after site time,<br/>in two or more sessions equal to six hours and twenty minutes. Such a schedule<br/>shall be provided to affected bargaining unit members during the prior school<br/>year. Should modifications of the scheduled dates be necessary, bargaining unit<br/>members shall be given at least two month’s notice. At least one make-up<br/>session shall be scheduled. If a bargaining unit member is absent, a half or full<br/>day, whichever is closest to the amount of time absent, shall be deducted from<br/>the unit member’s sick leave as Personal Necessity - No Reason (Section 8.C)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall attend work on scheduled professional development days<br/>unless on leave pursuant to Article XI Leaves.</p>
<p>A principal may release a unit member before the end of the required amount of site time,<br/>but after all responsibilities directly related to students, for the purpose of personal<br/>emergencies and medical appointments. Such release shall not be considered a leave of<br/>absence and there shall be no loss of pay.</p>
<p>Section 8. Kindergarten Planning Days</p>
<p>There shall be two (2) planning days during the school year, one per semester in<br/>November and March or such months determined by school sites. The District shall hire<br/>substitutes to cover the classes.</p>

The district shall reimburse bargaining unit<br/>members serving in split assignments for mileage between schools. Reimbursement(s)<br/>shall be made at the rate agreed to by the parties at the beginning of the split assignment<br/>for such reimbursements. Either party may request to renegotiate the reimbursement rate<br/>during the term of the split assignment if a substantial change in circumstances occurs.</p>
<p>A split assignment shall be defined as work within the regular work day at two or more<br/>schools. Coaching assignments or other paid extra-duty assignments do not constitute a<br/>split assignment.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VI<br/>SAFETY</p>
<p>It is understood that safety standards and procedures for enforcement of same are<br/>adequately covered in portions of the government code and shall not be duplicated within<br/>the Agreement.</p>
<p>The Moorpark Educators’ Association reserves the right to appoint two members to the<br/>District Safety Committee.</p>
<p>The District shall make available to teachers copies of laws covering the discipline and<br/>rights of pupils. Pursuant to Education Code 49079, the District also shall notify teachers if<br/>it has reliable information that students under their supervision have been convicted or<br/>disciplined for violent behavior or for the possession of weapons.</p>
<p>Drugs, Alcohol and Tobacco</p>
<p>1. The District and the Association have an important interest in providing a safe,<br/>healthful working and learning environment for employees and pupils.</p>
<p>In this Article the following definitions apply:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workplace. All District property and any place away from the District where<br/>District students are engaged in a school related activity.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope of Employment. Any duties performed as a District employee.<br/>Exclusions are: conferences, MEA and District social functions where District<br/>students are not present.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable Suspicion. A belief based on objective facts sufficient to lead a</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>reasonably prudent person to suspect that an employee is under the influence of<br/>a substance so that an employee’s ability to perform the functions of the job is<br/>impaired or so that the employee’s ability to perform his/her job safely is<br/>reduced. Reasonable suspicion may result from actual observation of the use or<br/>ingestion of a substance by an employee. It may be based on reliable<br/>information that the employee is currently using or has recently used or<br/>possessed a controlled substance, or open container with alcohol on the job.<br/>Reasonable suspicion may result from an observation of physical symptoms<br/>such as, but not limited to, slurred speech, red and/or watery eyes, unsteady<br/>gait, dilated pupils or sleeping on the job.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning September 1, 1995, smoking and use of tobacco products shall be<br/>prohibited on District property, including District parking lots, and in vehicles owned<br/>and operated by the Moorpark Unified School District. The tobacco-free policy shall<br/>apply to all buildings, grounds, and vehicles, as well as to employees acting within<br/>the scope of employment while off campus.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District encourages and will reasonably assist any employee with an alcohol or<br/>drug dependency to seek treatment or rehabilitation through available health<br/>benefits. The District will reasonably accommodate any employee with an alcohol or<br/>drug dependency, as long as such reasonable accommodation does not impose an<br/>undue hardship on the District. Sick leave and/or contractual unpaid leave may be<br/>used by an employee for treatment or rehabilitation of an alcohol or drug<br/>dependency by a physician or other professional specializing in such treatment or<br/>rehabilitation. An employee will be permitted to participate in outpatient treatment<br/>and/or in-patient treatment before a final dismissal.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employees must notify the Superintendent in writing within five (5) days of any<br/>drug statute conviction or of any driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol<br/>conviction for a violation occurring in any workplace or while the employee is acting<br/>within the scope of employment. A conviction includes any finding of guilt, including<br/>a no contest plea, or imposition of a sentence by any judicial body.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee shall possess, consume or be under the influence of alcohol at any<br/>workplace or when acting within the scope of employment. Any employee who<br/>possesses, uses or is under the influence of alcohol at any workplace or while acting<br/>within the scope of employment or who is convicted of driving under the influence of<br/>alcohol with a pupil or another employee while acting within the scope of<br/>employment may be dismissed, even for a first violation depending on the facts of<br/>the case.</p>
<p>Mere possession of sealed liquor products in a member’s vehicle is not in and of<br/>itself a matter for discipline unless otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee shall manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess, consume or be<br/>under the influence of illegal drugs or controlled substances at any workplace while</p>
<p>the employee is acting within the scope of employment. Any employee who<br/>manufactures, distributes, dispenses, possess, uses or is under the influence of<br/>illegal drugs or controlled substances at any workplace or any place while the<br/>employee is acting within the scope of employment is subject to discipline, up to and<br/>including dismissal, even for a first violation depending on the facts of the case. Any<br/>employee who is convicted or driving under the influence of illegal drugs or<br/>controlled substances with a pupil or another employee while acting within the scope<br/>of employment may be dismissed, even for a first violation. Depending on the facts<br/>of the case.</p>
<p>The terms illegal drugs and controlled substances include all chemical substances<br/>or drugs listed in any controlled substances laws or regulations, such as the Federal<br/>Controlled Substance Act of 1988 and California Health and Safety Codes, Sections<br/>11054 to 11058.</p>
<p>The possession or use of drugs under and consistent with the specific directions of a<br/>physician which does not seriously impair the performance of an employee or render<br/>the employee unfit to work with to work with children is not prohibited.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to search any District property, such as desks, lockers,<br/>cabinets, or other property at any time for any reason. However, a bargaining unit<br/>member’s locked desk may not be searched unless there is reasonable suspicion or<br/>probable cause related to prohibitions concerning drug or alcohol.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District official with authorization from the Superintendent or his/her designee may<br/>inspect an employee’s personal property when there is reasonable suspicion to<br/>believe that the employee is in violation of the prohibitions concerning alcohol, illegal<br/>drugs or controlled substances, and the employee is advised about the reason for<br/>the inspection. The employee may request an Association designated<br/>representative to be present during the inspection.</p>
<p>An employee’s personal property will not be inspected without the employee’s<br/>consent, but the District may discipline any employee up to and including dismissal if<br/>the employee refuses to consent to an inspection after being advised that a refusal<br/>to consent subjects the employee to discipline. However, such discipline will not be<br/>based solely on such refusal, but shall be based on all the facts of the case.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District, when there is reasonable suspicion, may request that an employee<br/>submit to drug and alcohol testing. Reasonable suspicion normally requires either<br/>information from a person who is known and whose credibility can be carefully<br/>weighted or another reasonable ground for suspecting that the testing will turn up<br/>evidence that prohibitions concerning alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances<br/>has been violated. A reasonable ground includes but is not limited to the employee<br/>appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the employee being found in<br/>possession of alcohol or suspected controlled substances, the employee being<br/>involved in an accident whose nature indicates impairment of ability or judgement or</p>
<p>the employee being involved in an incident in which a safety precaution was violated<br/>or a careless act was performed. The District also may request that an employee<br/>submit to drug or alcohol testing when the employee seeks to return to work after<br/>being absent for treatment or rehabilitation for alcohol or drug dependency.</p>
<p>An employee is not required to submit to drug or alcohol testing without the<br/>employee’s consent, but the District may discipline any employee up to and<br/>including dismissal if the employee refuses to consent to such testing. No discipline<br/>shall be imposed, however, unless the employee is advised about the reason for the<br/>testing and the employee refuses to consent to the testing after being advised that a<br/>refusal to consent subjects the employee to discipline. However, such discipline will<br/>not be based solely on such refusal, but shall be based on all the facts of the case.</p>
<p>Any consent or refusal to submit to the testing shall be in writing. If the employee<br/>consents to the testing, the employee also shall authorize in writing the release of<br/>the medical information. If the employee consents to the testing but refuses to<br/>authorize the release of the medical information, disciplinary action will not be taken<br/>because of that refusal. Disciplinary action, however, may be taken based on other<br/>available evidence. If the employee refuses to release the medical information to<br/>the District, it will not be available to assist the employee in any decision regarding<br/>discipline.</p>
<p>The District representative and an Association representative, if requested by the<br/>employee, may be present according to the policy and procedure of the lab or clinic<br/>and should escort the employee to the independent laboratory and/or clinic.</p>
<p>The independent laboratory and/or clinic requested to conduct any testing shall be<br/>instructed to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask the employee to provide a specimen. Test the specimen for the<br/>presence of any prohibited substances.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preserve and mark all specimens yielding positive results.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the lab report and any other information showing results to the<br/>District with written consent of the employee as specified in Section 9<br/>of this article.</p>
<p>If the first laboratory test shows positive results, the specimen will be tested again<br/>using a different test methodology. The employee may be asked to provide an<br/>additional specimen under the procedures described above.</p>
<p>Any second test must confirm a positive first test for evidence of alcohol or drug use.</p>
<p>A District representative will attempt to interview any employee where a test shows<br/>positive results. The employee will be given an opportunity at such interview to</p>
<p>explain the positive test result. If such explanation is satisfactory to the District<br/>representative, no discipline shall result from this test.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing reports will be treated similarly to other confidential personnel documents<br/>which have restricted access.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to hold harmless, save and defend the Association and any<br/>officer, agent or employee thereof from any and all liability for damages or attorneys’<br/>fees and costs arising out of any claim against the Association or such person or<br/>persons concerning the interpretation or application of these drug testing provisions.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association intend that these provisions shall be interpreted so<br/>as to give effect to all constitutional and statutory rights of employees, and to<br/>provide employees freedom from unreasonable searches.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>PUPIL DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written description of the rights and duties of bargaining unit members and<br/>administrators with respect to student discipline shall be presented to each bargaining<br/>unit member within the first month of the school year.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall not take disciplinary action against a bargaining unit member who uses<br/>restraining force against a student unless and until the District has conducted an<br/>investigation to determine the factual circumstances of the need for such restraining<br/>force.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall immediately report cases of assault and/or battery suffered by<br/>them in connection with their employment to the principal or other immediate<br/>supervisor.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII<br/>EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>A. Stull Act Evaluation Procedure to Assess Employee Competency</p>
<p>1. The District shall evaluate and assess employee competency as it reasonably<br/>relates to:</p>

The employee may attach a written statement indicating his/her<br/>disagreement with the specific goals and objectives.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment made pursuant to this procedure shall be reduced to<br/>writing and a copy thereof shall be transmitted to the certificated employee not<br/>later than thirty (30) calendar days before the last school day scheduled on the<br/>school calendar adopted by the Board for the school year in which the evaluation<br/>takes place. Upon receipt of an evaluation, a conference shall be scheduled<br/>between the evaluator and the employee to discuss the evaluation. The<br/>certificated employee shall have the right to initiate a written reaction or response<br/>to the evaluation.

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of the performance of each certificated employee shall<br/>be made on a continuing basis at least once each school year for probationary<br/>personnel, and at least every other year for personnel with permanent status. The<br/>evaluation shall include recommendations, if necessary, as to areas of<br/>improvement in the performance of the employee. In the event an employee is not<br/>performing his or her duties in a satisfactory manner according to the standards<br/>prescribed by the Board, the District shall notify the employee in writing of such<br/>fact describing such unsatisfactory performance. The District shall thereafter<br/>confer with the employee making specific recommendations as to areas of<br/>improvement in the employee's performance and endeavor to assist the employee<br/>in such performance. When any permanent certificated employee has received an<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation, the District shall annually evaluate the employee until the</p>
<p>employee achieves a positive evaluation or is separated from the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee shall receive an unsatisfactory evaluation unless there were at least<br/>two classroom observations during the school year of at least thirty (30) minutes in<br/>duration prior to the unsatisfactory evaluation. These two classrooms observations<br/>shall be followed by a written observation report within ten workdays or a post¬<br/>observation conference within ten workdays.</p>

The time periods in this<br/>provision 6 and in provision 5 shall be set aside during any period in which the<br/>employee or the evaluator is ill or absent.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any evaluation performed pursuant to this procedure which contains an<br/>unsatisfactory rating of an employee's performance in the area of teaching<br/>methods or instruction may include the requirement that the certificated employee<br/>shall, as determined necessary by the District, participate in a program designed to<br/>improve appropriate areas of the employee's performance and to further pupil<br/>achievement and the instructional objectives of the District. If an employee is<br/>required to participate in such a program, the program shall relate to the<br/>unsatisfactory rating.</p>
<p>An employee shall not be required to participate in such a program unless an<br/>attempt is made to reach an agreement on the nature of the program with the<br/>employee. Should the employee and the evaluator fail to reach an agreement on<br/>the nature of the program, the Superintendent shall determine the nature of the<br/>program.</p>
<p>Release time shall be provided when required by the nature of the program or<br/>plan.</p>
<p>The program shall not require costs to the employee unless agreed to by the<br/>employee.</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, during the term of this Agreement, the Legislature should modify he Stull Act<br/>(Sections 44660 through 44665 of the Education Code), this Article shall be<br/>reopened for negotiations.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may conduct a reasonable number of additional observations or<br/>assessments within its discretion. The District reserves the right to visit classrooms or<br/>other job locations at any time.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains the right to prepare and utilize Stull Act evaluation forms relating to<br/>the evaluation and assessment of the job performance of each bargaining member.<br/>Prior to the adoption of any Stull Act forms, the District shall seek input from the<br/>Association to assure compliance with this Agreement and to assure that the<br/>Association is given a reasonable opportunity to assist in the development of any<br/>proposed forms.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results of an employee’s mandatory participation in the Peer Assistance and Review<br/>Program shall be made available as part of the evaluation conducted.</p>

<p>20</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Program, as specifically cited by the Legislature, is intended to be a “critical<br/>feedback mechanism that allows exemplary teachers to assist veteran teachers in<br/>need of development in subject matter knowledge or teaching strategies, or both.”<br/>Effective July 1,2000, the District and the MEA agree that the District may implement<br/>the California Peer Assistance And Review Program For Teachers (PAR Program)<br/>under California Education Code sections 44500 - 44508 consistent with the provisions<br/>in this Article in any school year. This Article does not apply to probationary or<br/>temporary classroom teachers.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the MEA agree that the PAR Program in any school year may be<br/>contingent upon the actual receipt by the District of adequate funding from the State<br/>specifically designated for the PAR Program and may take action so that the District<br/>does not lose any funding under the PAR Program.

Both the program participant and the Superintendent or designee may<br/>submit a written response which will be attached to the peer evaluation report in the<br/>personnel file prior to the end of the ten-day period. A written response by the program<br/>participant is the sole remedy to the peer evaluation report.</p>

The<br/>District may adopt a new policy implementing the federal Family &amp; Medical Leave Act of<br/>1993, and the California Family Rights Act of 1991, as long as such policy is consistent with<br/>applicable law.

<p>Section 14. Catastrophic Leave Program &amp; Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>A. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “catastrophic illness” or “injury” shall be defined as an illness or injury that is<br/>expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, or that<br/>incapacitates a member of the employee’s family, such that the incapacity requires<br/>the employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time to care for<br/>that family member. Key to this definition is that taking time off from work creates a<br/>hardship for the employee because he/she has exhausted all of his/her sick leave<br/>and all other fully paid time off.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Members of the employee’s family” shall be limited to the spouse/registered<br/>domestic partner, children, son/daughter-in-law, brother/sister, father/mother,<br/>grandfather/grandmother, grandchild of the employee/spouse/registered domestic<br/>partner, or any relative living in the immediate household. [Ed. Code 44043.5(a)1]</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of this particular leave is to provide unit members economic relief for<br/>devastating personal health circumstances. Catastrophic leave may not be used for:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elective surgery,</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal necessity leave,</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal pregnancy,</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substance abuse rehabilitation,</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first teacher workday until September 30 of each school-year, there shall<br/>be an open enrollment period during which any certificated employee with no fewer<br/>than ten (10) accumulated sick days, may choose to join the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank by donating one (1) day of sick leave to the Catastrophic Leave Bank. In each<br/>subsequent year after the employee’s initial enrollment, each member of the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be required to donate an additional one-half (V<sub>2</sub>) day<br/>of sick leave to continue membership in the Catastrophic Leave Bank and to be<br/>eligible for requesting days under the Catastrophic Leave Bank language.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each new school-year, The District shall send a Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank Donation Form to all certificated employees requesting a donation of<br/>one (1) sick day to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank or one-half (y<sub>2</sub>) day to remain a<br/>member in good standing of the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The written authorization<br/>of the donation shall acknowledge that the donor understands that any and all<br/>donated sick days are irrevocable, will not be available for certification to CalSTRS,<br/>and can result in a reduction of service credit that would otherwise be available.</p>
<p>D. A certificated employee who is a member of the Catastrophic Leave Bank may<br/>request up to fifty (50) additional days of sick leave from the Catastrophic Bank in<br/>any twelve (12) month period as a result of catastrophic illness or injury. An<br/>employee may only request these additional days, under this program, once every<br/>three (3) years.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>E. The Assistant Superintendent of Personnel shall determine if the illness or injury<br/>meets the appropriate criteria. Determining criteria includes, but is not limited to,<br/>situations which are incapacitating, disabling, and lengthy both in terms of<br/>illness/injury and/or recuperation. If the Assistant Superintendent determines that<br/>the illness/injury does not meet the appropriate criteria, then the parties shall<br/>arrange for a meeting of a Catastrophic Review Committee. This Committee shall<br/>consist of two (2) representatives appointed by the Association, and two (2)<br/>members appointed by the Superintendent or his/her designee. If the Committee<br/>cannot come to consensus on the determination, then the final decision will lie with<br/>the Superintendent.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XX</p>
<p>PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT EDUCATION CODE SECTION 44948.3</p>
<p>With respect to probationary employees whose probationary period commenced during the<br/>1983-84 fiscal year or any fiscal year thereafter, the following provisions shall apply:</p>
<p>A. The parties acknowledge that such probationary employees may be dismissed or<br/>suspended during the school year without pay for a specified period of time under<br/>Education Code Section 44948.3. The reason that is sufficient to dismiss or suspend<br/>during the school year without pay such probationary employees is:</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsatisfactory performance determined pursuant to the Stull Act<br/>(Education Code Sections 44660, et seq.).</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause as defined in Education Code Section 44932.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall give thirty (30) days prior written notice of<br/>dismissal or suspension without pay not later than March 15 in the case of dismissal of<br/>second-year probationary employees. The notice shall include a statement of the<br/>reasons for the dismissal or suspension and notice of the opportunity to request a<br/>hearing. In the event of a dismissal or suspension for unsatisfactory performance, a<br/>copy of the evaluation conducted pursuant to Education Code Section 44664 shall<br/>accompany the written notice.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the notice of dismissal or suspension is given, the employee shall have fifteen (15)<br/>days from receipt of the notice of dismissal or suspension to submit to the Board of<br/>Education a written request for a hearing. The failure of an employee to request a<br/>hearing within fifteen (15) days from a receipt of a dismissal or suspension notice shall<br/>constitute a waiver of the right of hearing. If an employee does not request a hearing<br/>within fifteen (15) days and signs a settlement agreement with the District that the<br/>employee shall not seek any legal remedy against the District, the District shall pay<br/>medical benefits for the employee pursuant to current practice for one year beyond the<br/>last date of employment or until the employee is employed by an employer granting<br/>similar medical benefits, whichever is a shorter period of time, or at the employee's<br/>option, a sum equivalent to twelve (12) months of medical benefits in a severance pay<br/>stipend.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request for hearing, the Superintendent or<br/>designee shall select a neutral administrative law judge who shall conduct a hearing<br/>and submit a recommended decision to the Board of Education. The neutral<br/>administrative law judge may not be an employee of the District. If the employee, or<br/>the Association if it represents the employee, objects to the neutral administrative law<br/>judge selected by the Superintendent or designee, such objection must be<br/>communicated in writing to the Superintendent or designee within three (3) days of<br/>receipt by the employee of the identity of the selected neutral administrative law judge.<br/>If the employee timely objects to the neutral administrative law judge selected by the<br/>Superintendent, a neutral administrative law judge shall be selected by the parties from<br/>the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules.<br/>The recommendation of the neutral administrative law judge shall be advisory only.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hearing, the employee shall have the right to cross-examine District witnesses,<br/>to present relevant written and oral evidence and argument on his or her behalf, and to<br/>be represented by the Association or other representative. The neutral administrative<br/>law judge shall have authority to rule on questions of evidence and procedure,<br/>consistent with this provision. The employee shall be given at least ten days written<br/>notice of the date, time and location of the hearing.</p>
<p>F. The cost of the administrative law judge shall be paid for by the District.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of this Article are to notify bargaining unit members of the mandatory<br/>individual program of professional growth pursuant to Education Code Sections 44277-<br/>44279, to help bargaining unit members meet the requirements of these statutes, and<br/>to encourage proper implementation of these statutes. If, during the term of this<br/>Article, the Legislature should modify Education Code Section 44277-44279, and such<br/>modification(s) affect the provisions in this Article, this Article shall be reopened for<br/>negotiations within ten (10) days.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members covered by this Article shall develop an individual program of<br/>professional growth consistent with Education Code Sections 44277-44279, and<br/>applicable rules of the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, which consists of a<br/>minimum of 150 clock hours of participation in activities which contribute to<br/>competence, performance or effectiveness in the profession of education. A program<br/>is to be completed within five (5) year period intervals pursuant to Education Code<br/>Section 44277(e).</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptable activities shall include any acceptable activity defined by the Commission<br/>on Teacher Credentialing, Title 5 Rules and Regulations and the activities listed in<br/>Education Code 44277 (b) which include, among other acceptable activities, the<br/>completion of courses offered by regionally accredited colleges and universities;<br/>participation in professional conferences, workshops, teacher center programs or staff<br/>development programs; service as a mentor teacher pursuant to Education Code<br/>Section 44496; participation in school curriculum development projects; participation in<br/>systematic programs of observation and analysis of teaching; service in a leadership<br/>role in a professional organization; and participation in educational research or<br/>innovation efforts.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credential holder has a responsibility to record accurately the number of clock<br/>hours that have been spent on completed activities. After completing activities, it is the<br/>responsibility of the credential holder to give the advisor reasonable verification of time<br/>spent, if the advisor requests it. The credential holder has a right to receive full credit<br/>for all hours spent at professional growth activities (a) that are identified on the<br/>professional growth plan signed by an advisor, and (b) for which reasonable<br/>verification of time spent has been presented to an advisor.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to beginning an activity which could accumulate clock hours, the unit member<br/>shall develop and submit the proposed plan or amendment on an appropriate form to<br/>his/her Professional Growth Advisor and obtain certification from the Professional<br/>Growth Advisor. Within ten (10) working days, the Professional Growth Advisor shall<br/>review the proposed plan and certify to the unit member that the planned program or<br/>amendment meets all the legal requirements. If the proposed plan or amendment<br/>meets all the legal requirements, then the Professional Growth Advisor shall certify the<br/>proposed plan. If the proposed plan or amendment is not in legal conformance, then<br/>the reasons for legal non-conformance shall be placed in writing by the Professional<br/>Growth Advisor.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development, certification, implementation and/or verification of a professional Growth<br/>Plan shall be independent of any evaluation of the performance of the unit member<br/>that is conducted for determining the unit member's employment status.</p>

The Professional Growth Advisor shall,<br/>within ten (10) working days of receipt of notification of completion, either verify or<br/>refuse to verify, and return the updated original form to the unit member. Verification<br/>shall mean that the unit member has completed the number of clock hours specified on<br/>the form. If the Professional Growth Advisor refuses to verify the completed activity,<br/>the Professional Growth Advisor shall, within ten (10) working days of receipt of the<br/>submission, give a written notice of the reasons for failure to do so and notify the unit<br/>member of his/her right to appeal.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holder of a clear teaching credential and the District-appointed advisor shall<br/>maintain accurate, up-to-date records of the implementation of an individual program of<br/>professional growth. It is the primary responsibility of the holder to maintain such<br/>records.</p>

No member of the bargaining<br/>unit shall serve as a Professional Growth Advisor unless compensated at the rate of<br/>$100 per year per advisee. Unit member shall have a right to select their Professional<br/>Growth Advisor from any advisors appointed by the District, but no advisor shall be<br/>required t be the advisor for any specific bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>L. Unit members shall utilize Education Code 44278 to appeal applicable adverse actions<br/>which include:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the refusal to agree to a plan or modification;</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the refusal to verify the completion of an agreed program;</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bias, fraud, unfair discrimination, or arbitrary action by Professional Growth</p>

<p>Section 2.</p>
<p>Eligible teachers who wish to participate in job sharing must propose a job sharing<br/>arrangement to the District no later than March 15th of the school year preceding the<br/>school year in which the job sharing arrangement is proposed to take place. Each proposal<br/>must be made by two eligible teachers. A job sharing arrangement shall be approved only<br/>for one (1) year, but may be renewed on an annual basis. No job sharing arrangement<br/>shall be implemented without the prior written approval of the principal and of the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>Section 3. Required Contents of Any Job Sharing Arrangement:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall work together on each non-teaching preparation day prior to the<br/>opening of school and the first week of teaching days to ensure a smooth opening.<br/>Each teacher shall work the same amount of time per year. Minor adjustments will be<br/>made due to holidays, since they do not fall evenly throughout the year. In addition,<br/>they will meet as needed to prepare progress reports and plan parent conferences.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringe benefits shall be pro-rated according to the amount of time worked. Each<br/>teacher shall receive a pro-rated amount of health, welfare and leave benefits.<br/>Contributions to the State Teachers Retirement System shall be proportionate to time<br/>served and salary earned.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advancement on the salary schedule shall require two years in job sharing to advance<br/>one year whenever any teacher serves less than seventy-five percent (75%) of full¬<br/>time. If the teacher does not work a second year, the teacher shall not receive<br/>advancement credit for job sharing unless the teacher served at least seventy-five<br/>(75%) of full-time.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that one of the two teachers in a specific job sharing arrangement is<br/>unable to fulfill all requirements of the arrangement, the other teacher shall be returned<br/>to full-time status until an acceptable resolution is found and receives written approval<br/>of the principal and of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one teacher is absent, the other may assume the responsibility of covering the class.<br/>The teacher shall be paid the regular substitute salary for the days taught.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing teachers shall work on all regularly scheduled non-teaching workdays.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIII<br/>SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING</p>
<p>The parties acknowledge the importance of improving the instructional program through<br/>site-based decision making. When a school develops a site-based proposal it must be<br/>submitted to the Superintendent, the Board of Education and the MEA for approval if such<br/>a proposal has contract implications involving one or more articles of the Master<br/>Agreement. Side Letters of Agreement shall be entered into by the District and the MEA<br/>when appropriate in order to facilitate site-based objectives.</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that the provisions of any Side Letter of Agreement<br/>shall not be interpreted or considered in any way as establishing any precedent or any<br/>practice. It also shall not be interpreted or considered in any way as a violation of any<br/>agreement, condition or practice.</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that such side letters may be initiated for a period of<br/>one or two years and that renewal of side letters beyond the second school year would<br/>require the drafting of a second side letter for an individual school.</p>
