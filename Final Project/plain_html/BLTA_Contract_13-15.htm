<p>6.2 Time Limits:</p>

Time limits in this agreement may be extended by<br/>mutual agreement between the grievant and the District<br/>Administration.</p>
<p>6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by a grievant to meet a deadline set in this agreement shall<br/>terminate the grievance and the grievant shall not have a right to<br/>re-file on the same set of facts.</p>

<p>6.4 Procedure - Level One - Immediate Supervisor</p>

<p>6.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision rendered at Level I;</p>

<p>6.6 Level Three - Advisory Arbitration</p>
<p>6.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Superintendent will notify the bargaining unit in writing,<br/>that selection of panel members must be accomplished within ten<br/>(10) days of this notification.</p>

<p>6.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Panel shall furnish the Board with a full report of the<br/>grievance. The Board will schedule a hearing on the grievance at<br/>its next regularly scheduled meeting.</p>
<p>6.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Board shall be final and binding on all parties as<br/>an administrative decision but shall not limit the grievant’s right to<br/>seek civil redress.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>6.7 Representation</p>
<p>6.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request the Association to represent him/her in<br/>all levels of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>6.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee pursues a grievance without the intervention of the<br/>Association beyond the Informal Level, the grievance shall not be<br/>considered resolved until the Association has received notice of the<br/>grievance and the proposed solution and has been given an<br/>opportunity to file a written response.</p>
<p>6.8 No Reprisals</p>
<p>6.8.1 Neither the District nor the Association shall take any reprisals or<br/>unlawfully discriminate against any employee for the exercise of<br/>his/her rights under this article.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>HOURS</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher works a professional day. That work day normally begins not<br/>less than 15 minutes prior to the teacher’s first assigned duty. While<br/>teachers work a “professional” work day, as a practice teachers will not<br/>leave sooner than fifteen minutes after the close of the normal student<br/>day.

Such job related<br/>duty requirements shall be reasonably uniform for all bargaining unit<br/>members and shall not significantly exceed those that existed prior to the<br/>ratification of this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to a daily, duty-free lunch period of forty<br/>(40) minutes unless assigned to student supervision, in which case he/she<br/>shall receive a duty-free lunch period of thirty (30) minutes.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to a ten (10) minute break to occur at least<br/>one (1) hour prior to noon and another ten (10) minute break during the<br/>afternoon instructional period unless he/she is assigned to student<br/>supervision.</p>

<p>8.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary credit for no more than nine (9) semester hours<br/>will be granted in any one contract year. Units in excess<br/>of nine (9) will be banked and applied in future contract<br/>years.</p>
