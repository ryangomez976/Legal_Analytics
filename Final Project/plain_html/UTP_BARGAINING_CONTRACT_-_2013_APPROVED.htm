<p>ASSOCIATION RIGHTS</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District authorizes the Association to use the District's facilities and buildings at times other<br/>than normal working hours and hours of student instruction as long as the Association submits<br/>the appropriate Civic Center Act form to the immediate manager of the facility or building.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate manager of the facility or building may grant the Association use of District<br/>equipment as long as such use is in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Civic<br/>Center Act and as long as the use of such equipment does not interfere with the normal student<br/>instruction or work production of the District. The Association shall pay for the cost of all<br/>materials and supplies used.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of the unit member, the Association shall have the right to represent him/her in<br/>any employment conditions covered by this contract and proceedings related to dismissal<br/>actions, except as provided for to the contrary, elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>

<p>3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may make reasonable use of the District mail services and unit members' mail<br/>boxes for written communication to unit members.</p>
<p>3.5.1 The Association's written communications shall not defame or ridicule the District or its<br/>agents, nor shall it encourage the withholding of services (direct or adjunct)<br/>contemplated in Section 23.1 of the Agreement.

Authorized representatives of the Association shall be required to<br/>notify the site manager of his/her presence on the site. If the authorized Association</p>
<p>3</p>

Official business, as used in this section, shall mean conducting a called Association<br/>meeting at the site or the reasonable interviewing of witnesses for the processing of a<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to provide thirty (30) days of leave each year for Association representatives<br/>for the purpose of conducting Association business not prohibited by the provisions of Article<br/>XXIII (Work Stoppage).

<p>3.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Teachers of Pasadena shall have the exclusive right to represent the interests of its<br/>bargaining unit members on all joint and district-wide committees. Consequently the<br/>Association shall appoint its unit members to all District/Association Joint Committees. In<br/>addition, the Association shall appoint its unit members to district-wide committees, as it deems<br/>appropriate, for the purpose of contributing specific area(s) of expertise. The District's<br/>appointment of additional Association unit members to district-wide committees shall not<br/>diminish the number of the Association's appointments.</p>
<p>3.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designated representatives of the Association may make brief announcements at the end of<br/>faculty meetings provided the announcements do not involve controversial matters of<br/>employer/employee relations.</p>

<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article is intended to insure that the District retains all rights and powers which it has not<br/>agreed to limit in other Articles of this Agreement; this Article is not intended, nor shall it be<br/>construed as:</p>

<p>4.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determine, to the extent permitted by the Education Code, the utilization of persons not<br/>covered by this Agreement, including but not limited to substitutes, instructional aides,<br/>and others excluded in Article II, Recognition, to do work which is normally done by<br/>persons covered hereby, and the methods of selection and assignment of such<br/>personnel;</p>
<p>4.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determine the educational policies, procedures, objectives, goals and program,<br/>curricula, textbooks, course content, pupil placement, guidance, grading, testing,<br/>records, support services, pupil conduct and discipline policies, and extracurricular and<br/>co-curricular activities;</p>

<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above-mentioned rights of the District are listed by way of example rather than limitation,<br/>and the provisions of this Agreement constitute the only contractual limitation upon the<br/>District's rights. The exercise of any right reserved to the District in this Article in a particular<br/>manner, or the non-exercise of any such right, shall not be deemed a waiver of the District's<br/>right or preclude the District from exercising the right in a different manner.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the contractual rights of the Association and of unit members are set forth in<br/>the other Articles of this Agreement and that this Article is not a source of such rights.<br/>Accordingly, any dispute arising out of or in any way connected with either the existence of or<br/>the exercise of any of the above-described rights of the District, or arising out of or in any way<br/>connected with the effects of the exercise of such rights, is not subject to the grievance<br/>provisions of Article V. Provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall be construed to<br/>prevent the filing of grievances, pursuant to Article V, contending that an act or omission by the<br/>District constitutes a violation of an express term or some other Article of this Agreement, so<br/>long as such article is not by its own terms excluded from the grievance provision of Article V.</p>

</table>
<p>8</p>
<p>5.3 Procedure</p>
<p>5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level:</p>
<p>Before filing a formal grievance the grievant shall attempt to resolve the alleged<br/>grievance by having an informal conference with his/her immediate supervisor. Such a<br/>conference shall be held within twenty (20) days of the occurrence of the act or<br/>omission giving rise to the grievance, or within twenty (20) days from the date the<br/>grievant has, with reasonable diligence, knowledge of the act or omission.</p>
<p>5.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at the<br/>Informal Level and intends to pursue the matter, then, within ten (10) days after<br/>presentation of the grievance at the Informal Level, the grievant shall file a<br/>Formal Level One grievance in writing with his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level One:</p>
<p>5.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Formal Level One grievance shall be presented in writing to the immediate<br/>supervisor using the grievance form, with a copy simultaneously provided to the<br/>Association. The immediate supervisor shall meet with the grievant and<br/>designated Association representative within five (5) days of receipt of the<br/>grievance. The immediate supervisor shall provide a written disposition of the<br/>grievance, including the reasons therefor, to the grievant(s) and the Association<br/>within five (5) days of such meeting. These timelines shall be deemed extended<br/>if the grievant(s) and the Association representative are unavailable to meet.</p>
<p>5.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Formal<br/>Level One, then the grievant may, within ten (10) days of receipt of the decision<br/>at Formal Level One, appeal in writing to Formal Level Two to the District's<br/>designated Grievance Officer, with a copy simultaneously provided to the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>5.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level Two:</p>
<p>5.3.3.1 The District's designated Grievance Officer shall meet with the grievant and<br/>designated Association representative within five (5) days of receipt of the<br/>grievance appeal and shall provide a written disposition of the grievance,<br/>including the reasons therefore, to the grievant(s) and the Association within<br/>five (5) days of such meeting. These timelines shall be deemed extended if the<br/>grievant(s) and/or Association representative are unavailable to meet.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>5.3.3.2 If a grievance is not resolved at Formal Level Two, the two parties may mutually<br/>agree to implement the &quot;local grievance resolution process&quot; as contained in<br/>Section 5.3.4. The parties shall have ten (10) days from receipt of the written<br/>decision in Section 5.3.3.1 above to reach mutual agreement on whether to<br/>proceed to &quot;local grievance resolution.” If the two parties fail to reach mutual<br/>agreement, then within twenty (20) subsequent days the grievant may request<br/>in writing to the Association's Executive Board, at its next regularly scheduled<br/>meeting, that the Association submit the grievance to binding arbitration as<br/>contained in Section 5.3.5.</p>
<p>5.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level Three:</p>
<p>5.3.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association shall convene a &quot;local grievance resolution<br/>session&quot; within ten (10) days of mutually agreeing to utilize this process.</p>
<p>5.3.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association will designate up to three (3) representatives.</p>
<p>5.3.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District Superintendent will designate up to three (3) District<br/>representative(s).</p>
<p>5.3.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives for both parties will have full authority to reach agreement.</p>
<p>5.3.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association and the Superintendent or his/her designee have not resolved<br/>the grievance within twenty (20) days from the last meeting of the &quot;local<br/>grievance resolution session,&quot; the grievant may request in writing to the<br/>Association's Executive Board, at its next regularly scheduled meeting, that the<br/>Association submit the grievance to binding arbitration as contained in Section</p>
<p>5.3.5.</p>
<p>5.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level Four:</p>
<p>5.3.5.1 If the Association proceeds to arbitration, it shall notify the District in writing<br/>within five (5) days of the meeting referenced in Section 5.3.3.2 or Section</p>
<p>5.3.4.5 and shall simultaneously request a list of five (5) arbitrators from the<br/>California State Conciliation Service. Within ten (10) days of receiving a list of<br/>arbitrators from the California State Conciliation Service, representatives of the<br/>District and the Association shall agree upon an arbitrator and contact the<br/>arbitrator within two (2) days to schedule dates for arbitration sessions. The<br/>decision as to who strikes the first name shall be determined by the flip of a<br/>coin. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list until only one name<br/>remains. This person shall serve as the arbitrator.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>5.3.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall set forth the findings of<br/>fact, reasoning, and conclusions of the issues submitted. The arbitrator shall be<br/>without power or authority to make any decision that requires the commission<br/>of an act prohibited by law or which is a violation of the terms of this<br/>Agreement. The arbitrator shall have no power to amend, alter, change, or add<br/>to or subtract from any of the terms of this Agreement. However, it is agreed<br/>that the arbitrator is empowered to include in any award such as financial<br/>reimbursement or other remedies as proposed in the grievance. The decision of<br/>the arbitrator shall be submitted to the Association and the District and will be<br/>final and binding upon the parties. If any question arises as to the arbitrability of<br/>the grievance, such question will be ruled upon by the arbitrator before he/she<br/>hears the merits of the grievance, if it has been determined to be arbitrable.</p>
<p>5.3.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to, per diem<br/>expenses, travel and subsistence expenses, and the cost, if any, of a hearing<br/>room, shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other costs,<br/>except for release time for the grievant(s), Association representative(s), and<br/>witnesses, shall be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>5.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance<br/>shall be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any<br/>unit member.</p>
<p>5.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written statement of the grievance or appeals shall contain the provisions of the<br/>Agreement alleged to have been violated, the circumstances involved, the decision, if<br/>any rendered at the previous level, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>5.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing or pendency of a grievance shall not delay or interfere with implementation of<br/>any District action during the processing thereof.</p>
<p>5.4 TimeJJmits</p>
<p>5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day following receipt of the<br/>grievance appeal or written decision.</p>
<p>5.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time limits specified at each level should be considered the maximum and every<br/>effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be<br/>extended in writing by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>5.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance is not processed by the grievant in accordance with the time limits set<br/>forth in this Article, then the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the<br/>decision last made by the District. If the District fails to respond to the grievance in</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>accordance with the time limits set forth in this Article, then the grievance shall be<br/>deemed denied and the grievant may proceed to the next level.</p>
<p>5.4.4 If a grievance has not been resolved by the end of the school year, then the grievance<br/>clock stops and resumes after the first ten (10) student days at the start of the following<br/>school year at the same grievance level previously reached. The grievant shall have the<br/>right to exercise his/her discretion whether or not to waive, in writing, the above<br/>referenced timeline and continue the grievance procedure from the last day of the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Representation</p>
<p>5.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant may be represented by an Association representative(s) at all levels of the<br/>grievance procedure, to include the Informal Conference.</p>
<p>5.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may at any time present grievances to the District, and have such<br/>grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the Association, as long as the<br/>adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and such adjustment is not inconsistent with<br/>terms of the written agreement. The District shall provide a copy of the grievance to the<br/>Association within three (3) days of receipt of the grievance. If any employee presents a<br/>grievance on his/her own behalf, the Association shall have the right to be present and<br/>state its views at all grievance meetings. The District shall not agree to a resolution of<br/>the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the<br/>proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>5.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable release time shall be granted for processing grievances, however, meetings<br/>will normally be scheduled at a time that will not conflict with regular unit members'<br/>instructional duties. However, unusual circumstances may warrant that a grievance<br/>meeting be conducted during the grievant’s regular instructional time. When arbitration<br/>hearings are scheduled so as to conflict with the work hours of the grievant,<br/>representatives, and/or witnesses, release time without loss of salary or benefits will be<br/>provided.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Reprisals</p>
<p>5.6.1 No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the District against the grievant, any<br/>participant, the Association, or any party in interest in the grievance procedure.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VI</p>
<p>HOURS</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize that the varying nature of a unit member's day-to-day<br/>professional responsibilities does not easily lend itself to a duty day of rigidly established length.<br/>Unit members shall spend as much time as necessary to fulfill their instructional and<br/>professional responsibilities. Although the minimum site-based assignment hours may be less<br/>than forty (40) hours per week, it is understood that fulfillment of a unit member's total<br/>professional responsibilities will generally require a work week well in excess of forty (40) hours.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The On-Site Workday For All Unit Members Shall Be Structured As Follows.</p>

<p>contractual provisions contained in Article VI shall be observed; it is not the intent of the<br/>District to create new assignments for secondary teachers to regularly rotating<br/>supervision schedules of particular portions of the school site during the lunch period,<br/>or the periods prior to the warning bell before the start of the student day, or the period<br/>after the dismissal bell at the end of the student day.</p>
<p>6.3 District Wide Banking Time for Professional Development</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize the importance of and remain committed to weekly, collaborative<br/>professional development meetings and activities. The use of the term &quot;teacher&quot;<br/>throughout this language is intended to refer to all of the bargaining unit members:<br/>teachers, counselors, librarians, nurses, and speech pathologists, as applicable.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development involves independent and/or group activities designed to<br/>strengthen and improve teaching practices and student academic achievement.<br/>Professional development may include, but is not limited to, activities that improve the<br/>knowledge of teachers and principals concerning the academic subjects that teachers<br/>teach; effective instructional strategies, methods, and skills; and the effective use of<br/>standards, assessments and data to improve classroom practices, teaching and student<br/>learning. Professional development is a continuous process of individual and collective<br/>examination of practice. It should empower individual educators and communities of<br/>educators to make complex decisions; identify and solve problems; and connect theory,<br/>practice, and student outcomes.</p>
<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional development activities shall be offered on a weekly basis as part of a two<br/>hour &quot;Professional Development Meeting.&quot; The two hours or 120-minutes shall be<br/>accounted for as follows:</p>
<p>6.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school week of the 2007-2008 school year and thereafter, excluding<br/>holidays, all schools will bank 20 minutes of instructional time, Tuesday through<br/>Friday, for a maximum total of 80 banked minutes per week. These banked<br/>minutes reflect an increase of 20 instructional minutes per day, as defined in<br/>this Article VI - Hours, however, these banked minutes do not increase the &quot;on¬<br/>site workday,&quot; as that term is defined herein. The resulting 80 banked minutes,<br/>plus an additional 40 minutes of non-instructional time (on the Monday of the<br/>Professional Development Meeting) will be used to create the referenced<br/>weekly, two hour, &quot;Professional Development Meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>6.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Development unit members shall not participate in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; Monday<br/>professional development activities.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>6.3.3.3 During each school week of the 2010-2011 school year and thereafter, Child<br/>Development Programs shall not bank 20 minutes of instructional time during<br/>Tuesday through Friday.</p>
<p>6.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weekly-banked minutes will be utilized for professional development on the non¬<br/>holiday Monday, immediately following the week in which they were banked. If more<br/>time is banked than is used for professional development, the over-banked instructional<br/>minutes will be returned to teachers in the form of a shorter instructional day on the<br/>last workday before Winter Break and Spring Break. If more than one &quot;shorter<br/>instructional day&quot; is necessary to compensate teachers for the over-banked<br/>instructional minutes, then the second to the last day before Winter Break and/or<br/>Spring Break will also be used. On these days, unit members may leave the site fifteen<br/>(15) minutes after the end of the instructional day.</p>
<p>6.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District representatives and/or the site administrator shall lead professional<br/>development activities on &quot;A Mondays.&quot; Teachers shall lead individual or small group<br/>professional development activities on &quot;B&quot; Mondays.

<p>Tuesdays through Fridays: Kindergarten = two hundred five (205); Full-Day<br/>Kindergarten and Grades 1-5 = three hundred twenty-five (325); Grades 6-8 =<br/>three hundred sixty-five (365); and Grades 9-12 = three hundred ninety (390).</p>
<p>6.3.10.2 For Child Development Programs, the distribution of instructional minutes shall<br/>not conform to the Banking Time Framework, Section 6.3.10.1 of the<br/>Agreement, and shall conform as follows: Mondays through Fridays: one<br/>hundred eighty (180) minutes per session for two (2) sessions per day.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjunct duties that do not involve the entire staff are by their nature subject to sharing or<br/>distribution among the unit members and staff at each site. The District shall make a reasonable<br/>effort to assign adjunct duties on an equitable basis and with reasonable advance notice. Prior<br/>to the assignment of adjunct duties, volunteers will be sought; if a teacher serves as an annual<br/>club sponsor or in any other adjunct duty during the lunch hour, said service shall preclude the<br/>assignment of other adjunct duties.</p>
<p>6.4.1 If such duties are paid by student body funds or other sources, they shall not be counted<br/>in determining the &quot;equitable distribution&quot; of duties.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall administer the above in a reasonable manner.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have a duty-free lunch period, at a time arranged by site management, of at<br/>least thirty (30) consecutive minutes, exclusive of passing periods, except for student safety<br/>emergencies such as fire drills.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each full time unit member teaching under departmentalized conditions shall be afforded one<br/>scheduled class period as part of the regular basic assignment as a preparation/planning duty<br/>period. In situations involving STAR program testing schedules (or any successor program<br/>thereto), daily preparation/planning may be rescheduled by the site manager provided the unit<br/>member receives the same overall amount of preparation/planning time during a two week<br/>period of rescheduling as he/she would have received in the more traditional student<br/>instructional format. Elementary RSP Teachers will be provided with a preparation/conference<br/>period outside of student instructional hours. Preparation/planning duty time shall be utilized<br/>for professional preparation and planning purposes, unit member/student conferences, unit<br/>member/parent conferences, unit member/administrator conferences, administrative</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>assignments and student testing and guidance team meetings for Special Education Teachers.</p>

<p>6.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;student safety related emergencies, and</p>
<p>6.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substituting for a temporarily absent unit member.</p>
<p>6.7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member at a departmentalized school is required to render substitute<br/>service during his/her preparation period, he/she shall be paid the prorated<br/>amount of the daily substitute rate for a teaching period of substitute service; if<br/>a unit member assigned to a non-departmentalized school, or a<br/>departmentalized school without a preparation period is required to receive<br/>students from a temporarily absent teacher, he/she shall be paid the prorated<br/>amount of the daily substitute as the students he/she was required to receive<br/>bears to the number of students in the absent teacher's class (e.g., receiving 15<br/>of 30 students for a day will result in the payment of one-half of the daily rate of<br/>substitute pay). If administratively feasible, such substituting assignments shall<br/>be on a voluntary basis. Site administrators shall equitably distribute<br/>assignments for substituting for temporarily absent unit members among unit<br/>members with a common preparation/planning duty period.</p>
<p>6.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At middle and high schools with a &quot;Four-by-four&quot; block schedule, the District shall afford<br/>each unit member one class period daily for the purpose of preparation/planning or<br/>collaboration as part of the regular assignment as follows:</p>
<p>6.7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall afford each unit member one class period for the purpose of<br/>preparation/planning on each Monday equal in minutes to the number of<br/>instructional minutes of one Monday class period.</p>
<p>6.7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall afford each unit member one class period for the purpose of<br/>preparation/planning on each alternating day (Tuesday/Thursday or<br/>Wednesday/Friday) equal in minutes to the number of instructional minutes of<br/>one Tuesday-Friday class period.</p>
<p>6.7.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall afford each unit member one cfass period for the purpose of<br/>collaboration on each alternating day (Tuesday/Thursday or Wednesday/Friday)<br/>equal in minutes of one Tuesday-Friday class period. The process of<br/>&quot;collaboration&quot; shall be determined at each school site by the unit members<br/>and the Principal.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Teachers assigned Period 1. 3. 5. or 7 as his/her preparation/planning period</p>
<p>Monday preparation/planning period</p>
<p>Tuesday preparation/planning period</p>
<p>Wednesday collaboration period</p>

<p>6.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any school site wishes to change its Back-to-School Night and/or Open House for the<br/>subsequent school year to a date that is different than the Official Calendar, then the<br/>revised date(s) for Back-to-School Night and/or Open House shall be determined<br/>officially no later than January 31 of the current school year. Revised date(s) for Back-<br/>to-School Night and/or Open House shall be determined by a simple majority (50% plus<br/>1) secret ballot vote of UTP bargaining unit members at the individual school sites as<br/>conducted by the Association. These school-based decisions must take into account the<br/>need to accommodate parents with children at different grade levels, yearly testing<br/>schedules, Board of Education meetings, feeder school considerations, religious</p>

<p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
<p>EVALUATION PROCEDURES<br/>[Ratified by PUSD on 6/26/2014 and by UTP on 9/11/2014]</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of evaluation are to improve instruction, rate employees, and promote<br/>professional growth. The following contract provisions, along with associated board policies and<br/>district-adopted evaluation instruments, are designed to insure that:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cooperative and constructive instructional improvement plan is established by the<br/>evaluator and the evaluatee;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluative criteria, based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession<br/>(CSTP), their application and assessment are consistent throughout the District;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guidance and assistance are integral to the process; and</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due process is assured.</p>
<p>The District retains sole responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of performance of each<br/>unit member, subject only to the following procedural requirements. Accordingly, no grievance<br/>arising under the Article shall challenge the substantive objectives, standards, or criteria<br/>determined by the evaluator or District, nor shall the grievance contest the judgment of the<br/>evaluator; any grievances shall be limited to a claim that the following procedures have been<br/>violated or unreasonably applied.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of the performance of unit members shall be made on a continuing<br/>basis, at least once every year for probationary unit members. Should a unit member be<br/>employed after midpoint of the first year, evaluation for that unit member shall be at the option<br/>of the evaluator. Unit members with permanent status shall be evaluated at least every other<br/>year. Reasons for evaluating permanent unit members more often than the minimum required<br/>are: a new assignment or a significant change in the unit member's program, an unsatisfactory<br/>previous written evaluation, and/or the unit member's current performance has significantly<br/>declined since the most recent written evaluation.</p>
<p>8.2.1 Unit members with permanent status who have been employed at least ten years with<br/>the district, are highly qualified, as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801 (ESEA), and whose<br/>previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, shall be<br/>evaluated at least every five years if the unit member and the evaluator consent to this<br/>schedule. Consent may be withdrawn by either the unit member or the evaluator at any</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>time for any reason. Should the evaluator withdraw consent, the reason(s) will be given<br/>prior to initiating the evaluation process.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the implementation of non-substantive change in the existing evaluation forms,<br/>the District shall consult with the Association regarding possible changes. However,<br/>prior to the implementation of substantive changes to the existing evaluation forms<br/>(i.e., changes that would expand the criteria for evaluation beyond those set forth in<br/>section 8.1 above), the District will negotiate with the Association regarding such<br/>possible changes.</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A joint committee will be established to review/develop evaluation instruments for<br/>support personnel and child development teachers. The committee will be composed of<br/>an equal number of representatives on each side with a goal of implementing the new<br/>evaluation instruments. The committee will begin its work no later than thirty (30) days<br/>following the ratification of this Agreement.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site principal or appropriate supervisor shall acquaint each employee under his/her<br/>supervision with such formal written evaluation procedures and instruments as may be used,<br/>and shall give each employee the name(s) of the administrator(s) who will observe and evaluate<br/>his/her performance. If a subsequent change in the unit member's evaluator becomes<br/>necessary, then the unit member shall be notified on a timely basis by his/her immediate<br/>supervisor.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation time sequence in Section 8.11 shall be followed. The evaluation process shall<br/>take place during one academic year with appropriate follow-up activities.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall consist of a formative (data gathering) process followed by a<br/>summative (evaluative) process. The summative evaluation, using the results of the formative<br/>process, will result in the assessment of the individual's teaching performance.</p>
<p>8.4.1 Formative information gathering</p>
<p>Formative information consists of: formal observations in the classroom conducted by<br/>the unit member's site administrator(s), informal observation by the unit member's site<br/>administrator(s), and analysis and evaluation of instructional and professional activities.<br/>Informal observations and input from supervisors and consultants familiar with the unit<br/>member's work may be used, as may work samples, or any peer, parent or student<br/>input the evaluatee may wish to submit for the evaluator's consideration.</p>
<p>8.4.1.1 Informal information gathering</p>
<p>Informal observations by site administrators and input from supervisors and<br/>consultants familiar with the unit member's work may be used, as may work</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>samples; any peer, parent or student input the evaluatee may wish to submit<br/>for the evaluator's consideration may also be utilized.</p>
<p>8.4.2 Summative evaluation process</p>
<p>The evaluator will analyze all information gathered during the formative evaluation<br/>process, and complete the summative evaluation report. Following completion of the<br/>report, the evaluator shall hold a summative evaluation conference for the purpose of<br/>reviewing with the evaluatee all pertinent evaluative information as well as reviewing<br/>job improvement goals and discussing long- and short-range job improvement goals to<br/>be addressed during the next performance cycle.</p>
<p>8.5 The entire unit member evaluation process shall include the following activities;</p>
<p>8.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A planning conference will be held no later than September 30. The purposes of this<br/>conference shall be:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to review the District established performance areas, District and school wide goals<br/>and objectives, previously established long- and short-range job improvement goals;<br/>and to review the principal's expectations for unit members to support, implement and<br/>adhere to these goals and objectives; and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide an orientation related to evaluation procedures and instruments and<br/>contract provisions.</p>
<p>8.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual planning conference between the evaluate and evaluator will be held no<br/>later than September 30. The purpose of this conference shall be:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to discuss the evaluatee's professional growth plans for the year and establish<br/>appropriate job goals;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to agree on the initial observation date; and</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to review the key elements of each of the six CSTPs,</p>
<p>8.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSTP Goal Selection Process</p>
<p>8.5.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary unit members shall write goals on three of the six<br/>CSTPs. The unit member shall write one goal for each of the three CSTPs<br/>selected. The determination of two standards and two goals shall be the<br/>decision of the unit member and one standard and one goal shall be the<br/>decision of the administrator.</p>
<p>8.5.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members, whose most recent evaluation was overall<br/>&quot;satisfactory,&quot; shall write goals on three of the six CSTPs. The unit members</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>shall write one goal for each of the three CSTPs selected. The determination of<br/>three standards and three goals shall be the decision of the unit member.</p>
<p>8.5.33 Permanent unit members, whose most recent evaluation was overall &quot;needs to<br/>improve&quot; or &quot;unsatisfactory,&quot; shall write goals on three of the six CSTPs. The<br/>unit member shall write one goal for each of the three CSTPs selected. The<br/>determination of two standards and two goals shall be the decision of the<br/>administrator and one standard and one goal shall be the decision of the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>8.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal observations will be conducted as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A completed pre-classroom observation form must be submitted by the unit member<br/>no later than two days prior to the observation date.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-observation conference is optional at the request of either the evaluator or<br/>evaluatee.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observation must encompass one lesson or class period and in no event will be<br/>less than thirty (30) consecutive minutes.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) working days after the observation, a written report shall be<br/>completed by the evaluator and submitted to the unit member and a conference shall<br/>be scheduled to discuss the observation. Unit members shall receive the report at least<br/>one day prior to the conference.</p>
<p>8.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporting data and input may be used to assist in getting a comprehensive view of the<br/>unit member's performance.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator may use appropriate documented input related to the unit member's<br/>performance (based upon his/her observations as well as input from supervisors,<br/>consultants and other management staff in areas of expertise). The unit member may<br/>also request such data and submit these to the evaluator for consideration in drafting<br/>the summative evaluation report.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are encouraged to seek student input via data-gathering instruments<br/>and surveys, mutually developed by the administration and the bargaining unit. Such<br/>data is both optional and voluntary on the part of the unit member. The information is<br/>for input for the unit member and administrator. Unit members and administrators<br/>should take care to assure that students are not involved in the evaluative process of<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of a unit member shall not be based upon information or material which<br/>has been received by the evaluator from other sources, such as parents or citizens,<br/>unless, if requested by the unit member, a discussion has occurred between the unit</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>member and the person(s) who is the source of the data and the data has been<br/>produced in writing by this person(s). The evaluator shall make a reasonable effort to<br/>verify the information and material.</p>
<p>8.5.6 A summative evaluation report must be completed, and a conference held to discuss<br/>the report with the unit member, not later than April 15. Prior to the issuance of an<br/>unsatisfactory summative evaluation, a conference will be held between the evaluator<br/>and evaluatee.</p>

Thereafter, they shall be<br/>allowed on continued coverage pursuant to the terms of the insurance plan selected at<br/>their own expense, provided that they made advance payments of the premium in a<br/>manner reasonably required by the District.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leave protects the unit member by holding a position in the District for the unit<br/>member until the leave expires, and by retaining for the unit member the right to return<br/>to the District in a position of the same position classification at the conclusion of the<br/>leave.</p>
<p>9.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member's immediate supervisor may grant a unit member leave for one-half<br/>day or less provided no paid substitute is required.</p>

<p>9.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member returning from a leave that was granted for a specific length of time shall<br/>return on the agreed-to date or shall be deemed to have resigned from the District. The<br/>District shall notify a unit member granted such leave at least forty-five (45) calendar<br/>days prior to date of return, if the return is during the school year. If the return date is<br/>the beginning of school year, then notice shall be given to the unit member by the<br/>District on or before March 1. The failure to return on the specified date shall be<br/>deemed a resignation. The notice shall be by certified mail at the unit member's current<br/>mailing address on file with the District.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>9.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member whose absence under this section exceeds five (5) working days shall<br/>provide, upon request by the District, a statement from a licensed physician or<br/>practitioner or other appropriate source stating the reason for the absence, including a<br/>release for the unit member to return to District duties without impairment or<br/>restriction.</p>

However, if a school year terminates before the five month<br/>period is exhausted, the unit member may take the balance of the five month period in<br/>the subsequent year.</p>
<p>If the unit member is physically unable to resume his/her District duties at the end of<br/>the 100 day differential pay period described above, he/she shall be placed on a<br/>reemployment list.

<p>9.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time off work must create a financial hardship for the unit member because he or<br/>she has exhausted all personal sick leave, industrial illness and accident leave and/or<br/>any other paid time.</p>
<p>9.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A joint Association-District committee of equal representation must determine and<br/>certify that the unit member is eligible for catastrophic leave because he/she is unable<br/>to work due to the severity of that personal or family catastrophic illness, and only after</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>adequate proof of illness has been provided in accordance with Education Code Section</p>
<p>44043.5, and pertinent rules and regulations of the District.</p>

<p>9.12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers of eligible leave credits are irrevocable, and shall be donated only in full day<br/>increments.</p>
<p>9.12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who receives paid catastrophic leave shall first use any leave credits<br/>that he or she continues to accrue on a monthly basis prior to receiving paid<br/>catastrophic leave.</p>

<p>9.12.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The receipt of a donated sick leave credit through catastrophic leave as defined herein,<br/>when combined with other District income, shall not provide the recipient with a<br/>greater monthly District income/fringe benefit contribution than he/she received<br/>immediately prior to the receipt of catastrophic leave.</p>

<p>9.12.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Board of Education subsequently adopts a catastrophic leave policy for non-<br/>represented certificated employees of the District, and if the terms and conditions of<br/>the policy are parallel to this section, unit members shall be allowed to donate to, or<br/>receive from, said non-represented employees the catastrophic leave credits described<br/>herein.</p>
<p>9.12.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This catastrophic leave section shall not be subject to the provisions of Article V<br/>(Grievance Procedure) of this Agreement.</p>
<p>9.13 Family Care and Medical Leave</p>
<p>It is the intent of this provision to be consistent with Government Code section 12945.2 and the</p>
<p>Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, and it shall be interpreted so that there will be no</p>
<p>violation of those statutes.</p>
<p>9.13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee with more than one year of continuous service with the District, who has<br/>worked at least 1,250 hours during that year and who is eligible for other leave benefits<br/>of this Agreement shall be granted, upon written request, an unpaid family care leave<br/>up to a total of four (4) months in any twenty-four (24) month period, of twelve (12)<br/>weeks per year, pursuant to the provisions contained herein.</p>
<p>For purpose of this section the term, &quot;family care and medical leave&quot; means either: (a)<br/>leave for reason of the birth of a child of the employee, the placement of a child with an<br/>employee in connection of the adoption of the child or foster care of the child of the<br/>employee, or the serious illness of a child of the employee; (b) leave to care for a parent<br/>or spouse who has a serious health condition; or (c) leave because of serious health<br/>condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of<br/>that employee, except for leave taken for disability on account of pregnancy, childbirth<br/>or related medical conditions.</p>
<p>9.13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unpaid family care and medical leave shall be treated as any other unpaid leave.<br/>During an unpaid family care and medical leave an employee shall retain employee<br/>status with the District, and such leave shall not constitute a break in service. An<br/>employee returning from an unpaid family care and medical leave shall have no less<br/>seniority than when the leave commenced.</p>
<p>9.13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee's need for an unpaid family care and medical leave is foreseeable, the<br/>employee shall provide the District with at least thirty (30) days advance notice; for<br/>unplanned absences, the employee shall provide the District with reasonable advance</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>notice of the need for such leave. If the employee's need for such leave is foreseeable<br/>due to a planned medical treatment or supervision, the employee shall make a<br/>reasonable effort to schedule the treatment or supervision to avoid disruption to the<br/>operations of the District.</p>
<p>9.13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District requires that an employee's request for an unpaid family care and medical<br/>leave for the purpose of caring for a child, spouse or parent who has a serious health<br/>condition or for the employee's own serious health condition be supported by a written<br/>certification issued by the health care provider of the family member requiring care.</p>
<p>This written certification must include the date on which the serious health condition<br/>commenced and the probable duration of the condition.</p>
<p>For a leave based upon caring for a child, spouse or parent who has a serious health<br/>condition the written certificate must have an estimate of the amount of time the<br/>health care provider believes the employee needs to care for the individual requiring<br/>care, and a statement that the serious health condition warrants the participation of a<br/>family member to provide care during a period of the treatment or supervision of the<br/>individual requiring care.</p>
<p>For a leave based on the employee's own serious health condition, the written<br/>certification must include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the<br/>functions of his or her position.</p>
<p>If additional leave is required upon the expiration of the time estimated by the health<br/>care provider, the employee must request such additional leave, again supported by a<br/>written certification consistent with the requirements for an initial certification.</p>
<p>9.13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case in which the District has reason to doubt the validity of the certification<br/>provided pursuant to this section, the District may require at the District’s expense, that<br/>the employee, or as appropriate the employee's spouse, child or parent, obtain the<br/>opinion of a second health care provider. The second health care provider may not be<br/>employed on a regular basis by the District. If the opinions of the first and second health<br/>care provider differ, the District may require a third opinion, again at the District's<br/>expense, from a health care provider mutually agreed upon by the District and the<br/>employee. The third opinion shall be final and binding.</p>
<p>9.13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions:</p>
<p>a. For purposes of this section and consistent with current law, the term &quot;child&quot; means a<br/>biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of an employee</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>standing in loco parentis who is either under eighteen (18) years of age or an adult<br/>dependent child.</p>
<p>b. For purposes of this section and consistent with current law, the term &quot;parent&quot; means<br/>biological, foster, in-law, or adoptive parent, a stepparent or a legal guardian.</p>
<p>9.13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee applies for a family care and medical leave, the employee can elect, or<br/>the District may require, the substitution of paid vacation or other paid leaves to which<br/>the employee is entitled. If such paid leave is substituted, the employee is required to<br/>comply with the contractual requirements for use of such paid leave.</p>
<p>9.13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee granted a leave under this provision shall have a right to reinstatement to<br/>his/her former position (if it still exists) with equivalent benefits, pay, and other working<br/>conditions provided by this Agreement; if the former position no longer exists, he/she<br/>shall be placed in an equivalent position, with the equivalent salary, benefits, and<br/>working conditions provided for herein.</p>
<p>9.13.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee taking unpaid family care and medical leave pursuant to this section shall<br/>continue to be entitled to participate in District health insurance benefits to the same<br/>extent and under the same conditions as apply to other active employees receiving said<br/>benefits. The District may recover the premium that it paid as required by this<br/>subdivision for maintaining coverage for the employee under the group health plan if<br/>both of the following conditions occur:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee does not return to District service for a number of days equal to the<br/>duration of the family care and medical leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee's failure to return from leave is for a reason other than the<br/>continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that entitles the<br/>employee to family care and medical leave or other circumstances beyond the control of<br/>the employee.</p>
<p>9.13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family care and medical leave may be taken in one (1) or more periods. Leave may be<br/>taken in increments of at least one (1) day for recurring medical treatment certified by a<br/>health care provider.</p>
<p>9.13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy shall not be construed to entitle the employee to receive disability benefits<br/>under Part 1 (commencing with Section 3201) of Division 4 of Labor Code (Workers<br/>Compensation).</p>

<p>18.3.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of participation in the PAR Program is to assist the<br/>permanent teacher in improving performance. Permanent<br/>teachers who receive an unsatisfactory evaluation on their<br/>Certificated Teacher Summative Evaluation shall be required to<br/>participate in the PAR Program.

<p>93</p>
<p>review report by March 15. The Referred Participant shall have<br/>the right to submit to the Joint Panel a written response to the<br/>Consulting Teacher's report(s), the right to request a meeting of<br/>the Joint Panel, and the right to be represented at this meeting.<br/>The report, with the written response, shall be made available<br/>for placement in the Referred Participant's personnel file, and,<br/>in accordance with Education Code section 44662, subdivision</p>
<p>(d), shall be made available as part of the evaluation of the<br/>Referred Participant.</p>
<p>18.3.1.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By March 31, the Joint Panel shall review reports submitted by<br/>the Consulting Teacher and shall recommend in writing to the<br/>Governing Board through the Superintendent (and provide<br/>copies simultaneously to the Referred Participant, Consulting<br/>Teacher, and Evaluator) one of the following:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the assistance provided through the PAR Program has<br/>been completed and that the Referred Participant is<br/>demonstrating a satisfactory level of performance; OR</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That despite sustained assistance for at least two years in the<br/>PAR Program, the Referred Participant is not able to<br/>demonstrate satisfactory performance, and further assistance<br/>through the PAR Program will not be successful.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That continued participation in the PAR Program is<br/>recommended, The length of continuation in the PAR Program<br/>shall be set by the Joint Panel, but shall not exceed one year and<br/>shall be on a one-time basis. Following this period, the Joint<br/>Panel shall receive a subsequent report(s) from the Consulting<br/>Teacher pursuant to Section 18.3.1.1.4, after which the Joint<br/>Panel shall recommend in writing to the Governing Board either<br/>finding a) or b) in this section. The Joint Panel may instead<br/>recommend an additional year in the PAR Program, which shall<br/>be subject to the mutual agreement between the UTP President<br/>and PUSD Superintendent/designee. In no event shall a<br/>Referred Participant continue in the PAR Program in excess of<br/>three (3) years.</p>
<p>18.3.1.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Referred Participant shall continue in the PAR Program until<br/>he or she receives a satisfactory summative evaluation from his<br/>or her principal or designated evaluator no later than December</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>15. If the December summative evaluation was less than<br/>satisfactory, the Referred Participant shall continue in the PAR<br/>Program until he or she receives a satisfactory summative<br/>evaluation from his or her principal or designated evaluator no<br/>later than April 15. By May 1, the Referred Participant will be<br/>notified by the Joint Panel regarding his or her continued<br/>participation in the PAR Program.</p>
<p>18.3.1.1.7 Any grievance shall be limited to a claim that procedural</p>
<p>provisions of this Article have been violated. The judgment and<br/>recommendations of the Joint Panel and Consulting Teacher<br/>may not be grieved.</p>
<p>18.4 Volunteer Teacher Participants</p>
<p>18.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Voluntary Teacher Participant portion of the PAR program shall be referred to as<br/>Peer Assistance and Support System (PASS).</p>
<p>18.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PASS is designed to serve the Voluntary Participant who does not qualify for the BTSA<br/>program. The purpose of voluntary participation in the PASS program is to assist the<br/>teacher who seeks to improve his or her teaching performance through assistance of a<br/>Consulting Teacher and/or staff development opportunities.</p>
<p>18.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers will request the Joint Panel to assign a Consulting Teacher to provide peer<br/>assistance. The Voluntary Participant's request shall indicate area(s) in which he or she<br/>seeks assistance. The Voluntary Participant may terminate his or her participation in the<br/>PASS program at any time without a requirement to give a reason for the request.</p>
<p>18.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no available Consulting Teachers for a Voluntary Participant, participation in<br/>the PAR program will be made available for professional development opportunities. If<br/>the resources of the PAR program are insufficient to serve all potential Voluntary<br/>Participants for the PASS program, priority shall be given to Permanent teachers who<br/>request the assistance of a Consulting Teacher and/or staff development opportunities.</p>
<p>18.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of voluntary participation is to provide peer assistance; therefore, the<br/>Consulting Teacher shall play no role in the evaluation of the teaching performance of a<br/>Voluntary Participant.</p>
<p>18.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All communication, assessment of participation, and/or reports between the Consulting<br/>Teacher and the Voluntary Participant shall be confidential, and absent the written<br/>consent of the Volunteer, shall not be shared with others, including the site principal,<br/>the evaluator, or the Joint Panel.</p>

Proposed suspensions set forth in this Article may<br/>be appealed by the unit member directly to final and binding arbitration by following<br/>Section 24.3.6 above and thereafter the grievance procedure in Article V, Grievance<br/>Procedure, of the Agreement. The proposed suspension will not be imposed until the<br/>arbitrator's decision is rendered, except for just cause necessitating the immediate<br/>removal of the unit member from the worksite, in which case the unit member shall be<br/>placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the arbitration.</p>
<p>24.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall prevent the District and the Association from agreeing to utilize the<br/>procedure in Sections 5.3.4.1 through 5.3.4.4 in Formal Level Three of Article V,<br/>Grievance Procedure, during this process to discuss the proposed suspension and/or the<br/>bypassing of progressive steps prior to commencement of arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>24.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidentiality</p>
<p>All information or proceedings regarding any action(s) or proposed action(s) pursuant to the</p>
<p>Article will be kept confidential by the parties to the extent required by law.</p>

<p>Chiropractic and Acupuncture Benefits</p>
<p>Additional coverage for your Access+ HMO and Added Advantage POS<sup>SM</sup> Plans</p>
<p>Blue Shield Chiropractic and Acupuncture Care coverage lets you self-refer to a network of more than 3,310 licensed<br/>chiropractors and more than i ,245 licensed acupuncturists. Benefits are provided through a contract with American<br/>Specialty Health Plans of California, Inc. (ASH Plans).</p>
<p>How the Program Works</p>

<p>At the time of your first visit, you'll present your Blue Shield identification card and pay only your copayment. Because<br/>participating chiropractors and acupuncturists bill ASH Plans directly, you'll never have to file claim forms.</p>
<p>If you need further treatment, the participating chiropractor or acupuncturist will submit a proposed treatment plan to ASH<br/>Plans and obtain the necessary authorization from ASH Plans to continue treatment up to the calendar-year maximum of 30<br/>combined visits.</p>
<p>What's Covered</p>
<p>The plan covers medically necessary chiropractic and acupuncture services including:</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial and subsequent examinations</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office visits and adjustments (subject to annual limits)</p>

<p>Blue Shield of California: 80-E $20; Rx 5-20</p>
<p>Summary of Benefits and Coverage: What this Plan Covers &amp; What it Costs</p>
<p>Coverage Period: 10/01/2014-09/30/2015</p>
<p>Coverage for: Family | Plan Type: PPO</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copayments are fixed dollar amounts (for example, $15) you pay for covered health care, usually when you receive the service.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coinsurance is your share of the costs of a covered service, calculated as a percent of the allowed amount for the service. For example, if<br/>the plan’s allowed amount for an overnight hospital stay is $1,000, your coinsurance payment of 20% would be $200. This may change if<br/>you haven’t met your deductible.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount the plan pays for covered services is based on the allowed amount. If an out-of-network provider charges more than the<br/>allowed amount you may have to pay the difference. For example, if an out-of-network hospital charges $1,500 for an overnight stay and<br/>the allowed amount is $1,000, you may have to pay the $500 difference. (This is called balance billing )</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan may encourage you to use preferred providers by charging you lower deductibles, copayments and coinsurance amounts.</p>

<p>Blue Shield of California: 80-E $20; Rx 5-20</p>
<p>Summary of Benefits and Coverage: What this Plan Covers &amp; What it Costs</p>
<p>Coverage Period: 10/01/2014-09/30/2015</p>
<p>Coverage for: Family | Plan Type: PPO</p>
<p>Questions and answers about the Coverage Examples:</p>
<p>What are some of the<br/>assumptions behind the<br/>Coverage Examples?</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs don’t indude premiums.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample care costs are based on national<br/>averages supplied by the U.S.</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human<br/>Services, and aren’t specific to a<br/>particular geographic area or health plan.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient’s condition was not an<br/>excluded or preexisting condition.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All services and treatments started and<br/>ended in the same coverage period.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no other medical expenses for<br/>any member covered under this plan.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-of-pocket expenses are based only<br/>on treating the condition in the example.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient received all care from in-<br/>network providers. If the. patient had<br/>received care from out-of-network<br/>providers, costs would have been higher.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan and patient payments are based on<br/>a single person enrolled on the plan or<br/>policy.</p>
<p>What does a Coverage Example<br/>show?</p>
<p>For each treatment situation, the Coverage<br/>Example hdps you see how deductibles,<br/>copayments, and coinsurance can add up. It<br/>also helps you see what expenses might be left<br/>up to you to pay because the service or<br/>treatment isn’t covered or payment is limited.</p>
<p>Does the Coverage Example<br/>predict my own care needs?</p>
<p>* No. Treatments shown are just examples.<br/>The care you would receive for this<br/>condition could be different based on your<br/>doctor’s advice, your age, how serious your<br/>condition is, and many other factors.</p>
<p>Does the Coverage Example<br/>predict my future expenses?</p>
<p>*No. Coverage Examples are not cost<br/>estimators. You can’t use the examples to<br/>estimate costs for an actual condition. They<br/>are for comparative purposes only. Your<br/>own costs will be different depending on<br/>the care you receive, the prices your<br/>providers charge, and the reimbursement<br/>your health plan allows.</p>
<p>Can I use Coverage Examples<br/>to compare plans?</p>
<p>^Yes . When you look at the Summary of<br/>Benefits and Coverage for other plans,<br/>you’ll find the same Coverage Examples.<br/>When you compare plans, check the<br/>‘Tatient Pays” box in each example. The<br/>smaller that number, the more coverage<br/>the plan provides.</p>
<p>Are there other costs I should<br/>consider when comparing<br/>plans?</p>
<p>^(es. An important cost is the premium<br/>you pay. Generally, the lower your<br/>premium, the more you’ll pay in out-of-<br/>pocket costs, such as copayments,<br/>deductibles, and coinsurance. You<br/>should also consider contributions to<br/>accounts such as health savings accounts<br/>(HSAs), flexible spending arrangements<br/>(FSAs) or health reimbursement accounts<br/>(HRAs) that help you pay out-of-pocket<br/>expenses.</p>
