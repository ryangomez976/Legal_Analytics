Contractual implementation of these two days shall be done in a<br/>manner that qualifies them, to the extent allowed by law, as fully creditable under<br/>the State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) Defined Benefit (DB) Plan (e.g.,<br/>whether there is a need to add such days to the salary schedule for 2014-2015 and<br/>remove them beginning with the 2015-2016 school year). This aligns with the<br/>commitment of the district to continue to provide quality professional development to<br/>bargaining unit members as we continue the path and expectations of Common Core<br/>and the Technology Integration Plan.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the delivery of instruction/services to maximize and support student learning.</p>
<p>The District accepts as a fundamental premise for a successful evaluation program the</p>
<p>necessity for mutual respect and confidence to exist between the Evaluator and those</p>
<p>evaluated. It is understood and agreed by the parties that the principal objective of the</p>
<p>evaluation process is to maintain and improve the quality of education in the District.</p>
<p>Evaluation Procedure #1</p>
<p>1. Employees to be evaluated in a given year shall be informed in writing by their</p>
<p>Immediate Supervisor. A meeting shall be held with these employees within the first<br/>three (3) weeks after the opening of school to discuss and distribute the evaluation<br/>procedure and forms.</p>
<p>2 Site employees shall be evaluated by the Principal or the Principal's administrative</p>
<p>designee. Employees who serve more than one (1) school site shall be evaluated by the<br/>designated Administrator. Master Plan personnel who serve at a single site shall be<br/>evaluated by the site Principal. Employees of Indian Education, Bilingual Education and<br/>other District-wide special programs shall be evaluated by District or Site Administrators.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee being evaluated and the Evaluator shall meet no later than October 15 to<br/>discuss:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus standards to be targeted during the evaluation period.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A schedule of observations, conferences and final evaluation date.</p>
<p>4 Each employee shall develop in collaboration with site administrator a minimum of three</p>
<p>(3) focus standards. The focus standards will be chosen from the California Standards<br/>for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) (See Appendix G-T); one (1) selected by the<br/>Evaluatee, one (1) selected by the Evaluator and a third which shall be mutually agreed<br/>upon. In developing these focus standards, personnel should consider District-wide<br/>goals and their current job assignment. Where prior evaluations have indicated a need<br/>for improvement, the employee shall include focus standards designed to address<br/>identified concerns.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus standards for non-instructional personnel shall be related to job responsibilities.</p>
<p>All focus standards will be entered on the appropriate form and signed by the Evaluator<br/>and the evaluatee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first observation which must occur before winter break, if the Supervisor or the<br/>Evaluator feels there is serious concern about an area of the employee's performance,<br/>the Immediate Supervisor or Evaluator may substitute or add one (1) additional focus<br/>standard to be addressed [not to exceed a total of four (4)]. The focus standard,<br/>evidence of progress, and steps for improvement shall be written on or attached to the<br/>evaluation form. The Evaluator(s), if other than the Immediate Supervisor, shall be<br/>notified of this additional focus standard.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Evaluator is responsible for seeing that the evaluative process is initiated. The<br/>Evaluator and employee are mutually responsible for seeing that the evaluative process<br/>is carried out. The Evaluator shall maintain an up-to-date status report on the progress<br/>of evaluation.</p>
<p>17-1</p>
<p>Employees who do not cooperate in the selection of their focus standards and<br/>procedures shall have their focus standards chosen for them by their Immediate<br/>Supervisor or Evaluator.</p>

<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee shall have the right to request through the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Personnel an additional evaluator from all District Administrators.</p>
<p>Frequency of Evaluations</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of performance of each employee shall be made on a<br/>continuing basis. Probationary and temporary employees shall be evaluated every year<br/>for the first two (2) consecutive years of employment in the District and at least every<br/>other year thereafter. Employees with permanent status shall be evaluated at least<br/>every other year except as indicated in #4 below (5-Year Evaluation Cycle).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees employed after November 1 or reassigned after October 1 will meet with<br/>their Supervisor and set focus standards, evidence of progress, and check point dates<br/>as appropriate to the evaluatee's job description and the time remaining in the school<br/>year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two (2) formal observations shall take place prior to the final evaluation report.<br/>Such observations shall be arranged between the Evaluator and the employee. The<br/>Evaluator shall base his/her evaluation of an employee on information, Including but not<br/>limited to, that collected through direct observation and assessment of and conference<br/>with the employee. Any information obtained by means other than by direct observation<br/>by the Evaluator that is to be placed in the evaluation report, shall be identified as to the<br/>event, person(s) observing event, Evaluator's source of information, time, place and date<br/>of occurrence. In the event the information is not documented as here required, it shall<br/>not be placed in the evaluation report. These observations shall be written by the<br/>Evaluator, discussed and signed by both parties at a conference.</p>
<p>4 Notwithstanding the above, a unit member may be evaluated every five (5) years<br/>provided the unit member (1) has permanent status; (2) has been employed by the<br/>District for at least ten years; (3) is highly qualified as defined in 20 U.S.C. Section 780, if<br/>serving in a position that requires this designation under state and/or federal law; (4)<br/>had an immediately preceding evaluation meeting or exceeding standards (proficient or<br/>above); and (5) the unit member and evaluator agree in writing to the five (5) year<br/>evaluation cycle. The unit member or evaluator may withdraw from the agreement no<br/>later than October 1 of any school year in which case the unit member shall be<br/>evaluated that year. This provision shall not preclude a supervisor from making informal<br/>observations at any time. (See “5-Year Evaluation Cycle Agreement, attached as<br/>Appendix V-2”)</p>
<p>Evaluation Procedure #2</p>
<p>As an alternative, tenured teachers (in agreement with their Supervisor) shall be given the<br/>option of choosing a self-directed evaluation process.

<p>orienting personnel to the evaluation.</p>
<p>Evaluation Reports</p>

After the conference, the Evaluator will give the employee a<br/>duplicate copy of the summary or written report signed by the Evaluator and the<br/>employee. The signature of the employee shall not imply either agreement or<br/>disagreement with the evaluation report. If the employee is in disagreement with the<br/>content of the report, he/she will so state in writing and this statement will become a<br/>permanent part of the evaluation report,</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual evaluation reports filed in the District Office will contain no statement which<br/>has not been made available to the evaluatee prior to its being placed in his/her<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Evaluator will confer with the employee and make specific recommendations in<br/>writing relative to techniques and procedures for improving noted areas of concern.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who receives an evaluation report which suggests substantial areas of<br/>concern shall be entitled to an evaluation on the subsequent year. The employee's<br/>Evaluator shall make specific recommendations for improvement and provide assistance<br/>in implementing such recommendations, including but not limited to, a reasonable<br/>released time for the employee to visit and observe other similar classes in other<br/>schools. If subsequent remedial action eliminates the areas of concern, this will be<br/>noted and attached to the previous negative evaluation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the employee's evaluation is unsatisfactory and dismissal is recommended,<br/>all due process requirements contained in the Education Code will be followed. Second<br/>year probationary employees who will not be re-elected shall be notified by March 15.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Final Summary Evaluation will be a composite made by those evaluators who have<br/>observed the employee's work.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials in personnel files of employees, which may serve as a basis for affecting the<br/>status of their employment, are to be made available for the inspection of the person<br/>involved. Every employee shall have the right to inspect these materials upon request,<br/>provided that the request is made at a time when such person is not actually required to<br/>render services to the District. Such material is not to include ratings, reports, or records<br/>which: (1) were obtained prior to the employment of the person involved, (2) were<br/>prepared by identifiable examination committee members, or (3) were obtained in<br/>connection with a promotional examination.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature, except material mentioned in Section 2 above, shall<br/>not be entered or filed unless and until the employee is given notice and an opportunity<br/>to review and comment thereon. An employee shall have the right to enter and have<br/>attached to any such derogatory statement his own comments thereon. Such review<br/>shall take place during normal business hours, and the employee shall be released from<br/>duty for this purpose without salary reduction.</p>
<p>4 Upon written authorization by the employee, a representative of the Association shall be<br/>permitted to examine and/or obtain copies of materials at cost in such employee's<br/>personnel file.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is derogatory material in the employee's personnel file about which the employee<br/>is concerned, the employee may request a review of the material by the Superintendent;<br/>and the Superintendent will determine its disposition. In most cases, derogatory material<br/>will not be removed in less than four (4) years from the date of the material.

<p>Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a written claim by one (1) or more employees, or by the Association<br/>when so authorized in writing by the employee(s), that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of a specific provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; is a person or persons and/or the Association or representative thereof, as<br/>indicated above, making the claim.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;party in interest&quot; is any person who might be required to take action or against whom<br/>action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Day&quot; is any day the District Office is open</p>
<p>General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to a grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any employee prior to<br/>initiating the formal grievance process to discuss the matter informally with the<br/>Immediate Supervisor or any appropriate member of the Administration to whom it<br/>applies and to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by the Association,<br/>provided that the adjustment is consistent with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits<br/>specified at each level should be considered to be maximums; and every effort should<br/>be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be modified by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all the<br/>steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school year and if left unresolved<br/>could result in harm to the grievant, the time limits set forth herein will be reduced by<br/>mutual agreement so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school<br/>year or as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievant shall attend all meetings scheduled to hear his/her grievance when physically<br/>able to do so.</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, when authorized in writing by an affected employee or employees, may<br/>initiate a grievance which affects one or more employees in a single building or<br/>employees in more than one building at Level II.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>Administration at the level above the Principal or Immediate Supervisor, the grievant<br/>shall submit such grievance in writing to the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel and<br/>the Association directly and the processing of such grievance will be commenced at<br/>Level II.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at Levels II and III of the grievance procedure will be in writing<br/>setting forth the decision and the reasons, and will be transmitted promptly to all parties<br/>in interest and to the President of the Association.</p>
<p>19-1</p>
<p>9 When it is required that an employee of the District be absent from his/her duties</p>
<p>pursuant to these procedures, he/she shall not suffer any loss of pay. Authorization for<br/>such absence must be obtained from the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance<br/>will be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of<br/>the participants.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievance form is in the Appendix of this contract.</p>
<p>12 During these proceedings and until a final determination has been reached, all<br/>proceedings shall be confidential.</p>
<p>13. A decision rendered at any step in these procedures becomes final unless appealed<br/>within the time limit specified, providing the grievant is physically able to do so. If a<br/>decision is not given within the time limit, an appeal may be taken directly to the next<br/>level. The grievant shall continue to discharge assigned duties and comply with the<br/>direction of the administration while the grievance is being resolved as long as<br/>compliance does not endanger the health, safety or property of the person.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by<br/>himself/herself or, at his/her option, by a representative selected by the Association. If<br/>an employee is not represented by the Association or its representative, the District shall<br/>not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of<br/>the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a<br/>response.</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee's request for transfer shall bear the signature of that<br/>employee's present Administrator. Such signature is an acknowledgment<br/>only that the Administrator has been informed of the employee's desire for<br/>transfer consideration. Such signature does not necessarily imply<br/>approval or disapproval of the Administrator nor may the acknowledgment<br/>be withheld by the Administrator.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Office shall notify appropriate Administrators of employee<br/>requests for transfer.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Office shall give the employee and appropriate<br/>Administrators official notification of the disposition of the voluntary<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a voluntary transfer is denied, the employee shall be provided, upon</p>
<p>20-2</p>
<p>written request, the specific reasons in writing for the denial. Specific<br/>reasons for the denial of the position shall be developed by the Principal<br/>and transmitted by the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel to the<br/>employee within five (5) days of the request for reasons.</p>
<p>Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>All involuntary transfers under this section shall occur within the same level (i.e., K-8, 6-<br/>12) of previous District experience. Exceptions to same level provision may be made if<br/>mutually agreed upon by the teacher concerned and the District.</p>
<p>Employees being transferred shall receive assistance from the District in the relocation<br/>of personal instructional equipment and materials necessary to the new assignment. In<br/>transfers occurring due to school closures, a teacher shall receive the equivalent of one</p>
<p>(1) working day released time for preparation for moving. If the school closure decision<br/>is reached during the summer, any teacher may request and receive one (1) day for<br/>moving prior to the opening of school to be compensated at the daily substitute rate.

Once a displaced<br/>employee selects a position or is placed from current vacancies, that person shall no<br/>longer be considered displaced, but may request consideration for voluntary transfer<br/>should future vacancies occur.</p>
<p>a. Involuntary Transfers for Proaram/Enrollment</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer may be made by the District at any time because of a change<br/>in enrollment from a reduction in program. Teachers who are involuntarily<br/>transferred shall have the option to return to their previous position if that<br/>position is reopened within five (5) school days of the involuntary transfer.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of school closure, the Administration shall consult with the<br/>Association within five (5) days of such decision regarding the timeline to<br/>be followed in the implementation of the involuntary transfer procedures.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary (6-12)</p>
<p>A list of all the vacant assignments shall be made available to each<br/>employee being considered in involuntary transfer. An employee<br/>may request the positions for which credentialed, in order of<br/>preference, to which transfer is desired. An employee must be<br/>given a conference and/or a written statement regarding the<br/>reasons for the involuntary transfer a minimum of twenty (20) days<br/>prior to the transfer. District seniority shall be the determining factor<br/>in an involuntary transfer for program provided a qualified employee<br/>is available within the administrative unit to fill the vacancy created<br/>by the person being transferred.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary (K-8)</p>
<p>Prior to August 1, a determination shall be made as to the number<br/>and identity of employees at the elementary level who may be<br/>transferred for program and affected employees shall be informed.<br/>When it is necessary to transfer employees to non-classroom<br/>assignments, the appropriate number of classroom teachers with<br/>least seniority in the District will be transferred to these<br/>assignments. No teacher shall be involuntarily transferred if there is</p>
<p>20-3</p>
<p>another teacher within that administrative unit with less District-wide<br/>seniority who is credentialed to fill the vacancy. A list of all the<br/>vacant assignments shall be made available to each employee<br/>being considered for involuntary transfer. An employee may<br/>request the positions for which credentialed in order of preference to<br/>which transfer is desired. Requests shall be considered in order of<br/>seniority. If no like or comparable (i.e., K-8, 6-12) vacant position is<br/>available, the like or comparable position held by the least senior<br/>employee in the District will be offered. In no case will an employee<br/>&quot;bump&quot; another employee with greater District seniority. If the<br/>position is accepted, the provisions of Article 20, Section 3,<br/>(Involuntary Transfer for Program) will not apply to the displaced<br/>teacher and that teacher will be assigned to an available vacancy.</p>
<p>An employee must be given a conference and/or a written statement<br/>regarding the reasons for the involuntary transfer a minimum of<br/>twenty (20) days prior to the transfer.</p>
<p>(c) A unit member not subject to involuntary transfer may request to<br/>take the place of the unit member being involuntarily transferred.</p>
<p>The approval or denial shall be at the discretion of the site<br/>principal/program administrator.</p>
<p>b. Involuntary Transfer for Performance</p>
<p>A transfer may also be consummated by the District if it has been determined, in<br/>accordance with the evaluation process that an involuntary transfer is necessary<br/>to improve performance.</p>
<p>Prior to the transfer, the District shall fulfill its obligation to evaluate such<br/>employee in accordance with the procedures outlined in Article 17, Evaluation of<br/>Employees.</p>
<p>The employee will be informed by written statement from the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Personnel of the nature of the transfer and the reason for its<br/>initiation.</p>
<p>4 Involuntary Transfer bv the Superintendent</p>
<p>If procedures in this article do not result in a personnel adjustment felt to be necessary<br/>by the District, the Superintendent will make the necessary transfer. Prior to the<br/>initiation of such a transfer, and after all the above voluntary and involuntary transfer<br/>procedures have been exhausted, a review of the specific situation will be conducted<br/>with input from both the Superintendent and the Association's Executive Board. A<br/>written statement of the findings will be forwarded to the employee and the Association<br/>within three (3) days. Action on the transfer will not be taken until five (5) days after the<br/>initial notification to the Association’s Executive Board.</p>
<p>20-4</p>
<p>21.</p>
<p>Class Size</p>
<p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grades TK-5, the District will maintain an average class size of twenty-eight (28)<br/>students; and except under the conditions outlined below, no regular class shall exceed<br/>an enrollment of thirty (30) students and no combination class shall exceed an<br/>enrollment of twenty-eight (28) students. At Martinez Junior High School, the District will<br/>attempt to maintain an average class size of thirty-two (32), and a maximum teacher<br/>load of one hundred sixty-two (162) pupils. At Alhambra High School, the District will<br/>attempt to maintain an average class size of thirty-three (33), and a maximum teacher<br/>load of one hundred sixty-seven (167) pupils. Maximum teacher loads for part-time<br/>teachers shall be prorated. Input from department heads and faculty members shall be<br/>considered in an effort to distribute equitably student load per teacher, while ensuring<br/>the rights and educational opportunities of students.</p>
<p>Exceptions to the above secondary maximums may occur in unusual situations, such as<br/>new students who need particular courses and/or credits based upon provisions of law,<br/>college entrance or graduation requirements, and/or changes in particular personnel<br/>during the school year.</p>
<p>It is the District's intent not to implement these exceptions in a discriminatory manner or<br/>to use them to systematically alter the class size and maximum teacher loads contained<br/>in this article.</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In secondary industrial arts, fine arts, laboratory sciences, world language and computer<br/>lab classes, the District will limit class size to the actual number of identified work<br/>stations. Identified work stations will be mutually agreed upon by the building<br/>Administrator and Department Chairperson or Lead Teacher with input from the teacher<br/>before the beginning of school. Identified work stations are areas equipped with<br/>appropriate functioning software and equipment. In those cases where agreement<br/>cannot be reached, the matter will be referred to the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Personnel and an Association designated representative who will develop a<br/>recommendation for the Superintendent. The teacher station shall not be used as a<br/>student station. The decision of the Superintendent will be final.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will limit Special Education full-day classes to the maximum set forth in Title<br/>V regulations, but will strive to keep special day class enrollment to fifteen (15) students<br/>or less. Each building Administrator must consider equal distribution among regular<br/>classes as well as the enrollment in those classes before mainstreaming Special<br/>Education students, taking into account each student’s emotional stability, academic<br/>ability, and physical limitations. Placement will be determined by the IEP team which<br/>may include the receiving teacher. Information from the IEP meeting will be shared with<br/>the classroom teacher within five school days from the student’s first day of school for<br/>Resource Specialist students, and prior to placement of an SDC student. Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Personnel will identify a case manager for the purpose of notifying all<br/>necessary personnel. The District will strive to keep the class size for each session of<br/>the Martinez Early Intervention Preschool Program to no more than (10) students and<br/>the total case load for each MEIPP teacher no more than sixteen (16)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of full inclusion is predicated on the right of all students to receive in a non-<br/>discriminatory fashion a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive<br/>environment. Full inclusion is one (1) of the options in the continuum of educational<br/>services and instructional delivery models available to students with disabilities as<br/>determined by an IEP. Full inclusion exists when students with disabilities attend age</p>
<p>21-1</p>
<p>appropriate regular education classes in their home school, for the same number of<br/>instructional minutes as their peers.</p>
<p>Full-inclusion students will be identified by the site IEP team. Full inclusion of these<br/>students in the regular classroom shall be according to the following guidelines:</p>
<p>a The District shall initially seek a volunteer from the affected site before assigning<br/>a full-inclusion student to a class roster.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who is assigned one (1) or more full-inclusion students shall be notified<br/>as early as possible regarding the enrollment of such a student in his/her class.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the first day of attendance of a student previously identified by the District<br/>as a full-inclusion student, the teacher shall be informed of the student’s medical<br/>needs, receive a copy of the District’s medical emergency plan for that student<br/>and a copy of the student's IEP.</p>
<p>d The District will provide the following to a teacher who has been assigned a full-<br/>inclusion student:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff Development</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate curricular and adaptive instructional materials and equipment<br/>as specified in the IEP</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support from a District specialist or resource teacher specialist</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the District may offer the following to a teacher who has been<br/>assigned a full-inclusion student:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of a classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aide</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra materials</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transition support through release time by both the former teacher and<br/>the full-inclusion teacher</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary level during any specific class period, unless the teacher of the<br/>full-inclusion student agrees otherwise, his/her class roster shall be the last roster<br/>to reach maximum class size for that grade level or subjects at the school site<br/>(see example).</p>
<p>Example: Three (3) college preparatory classes offered at the same period<br/>Class A = Full-inclusion student on class rolls</p>
<p>Class B &amp; C = Filled to their maximums before Class A would be filled to its<br/>maximum &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ _</p>
<p>5. In certain specific instances where the education program would not be impaired, an</p>
<p>exception may be made in the maximums defined in this article if mutually agreed upon<br/>after discussion by the Association/employee(s) and the Principal. If the Association and<br/>the employee(s) disagree with each other, the position of the employee(s) will prevail.</p>
<p>The following are choices offered by the District that are available to the employee in an<br/>overload situation, but do not limit the employee, nor the Principal, from exploring other<br/>solutions that might be more appropriate to a particular school site's unique situation.</p>
<p>This arrangement would continue as long as the overload condition exists (maximum of<br/>thirty-one (31) students in regular K-5 classroom, one hundred sixty-three (163) or 37<br/>students in an individual classroom in junior high, and one hundred sixty-eight (168) or</p>
<p>21-2</p>
<p>38 students in an individual class in high school, and twenty-three (23) students at<br/>Vicente Martinez High School.</p>
<p>a One (1) hour of aide time for each day that the overload situation exists [after the<br/>fifteen (15) day period between the twenty-first (21<sup>st</sup>) day of student contact to<br/>May 1 per item 8 of this article is exceeded], or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten dollars ($10) per elementary student or five dollars ($5) per day per student<br/>for elementary specialist (elementary specialists are not voluntary) or five dollars<br/>($5) per day per secondary student, with the exception of Vicente Martinez High<br/>School, which is five dollars ($10) per day. When payment is the chosen solution<br/>to an overload situation, the Board of Education must give approval prior to<br/>authorization of payment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a teacher volunteers to receive an overload student, he/she may not<br/>reverse that decision.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher volunteers to accept an overload student, the teacher will get credit<br/>for the option chosen from the first day the student reports to class and each day<br/>thereafter as long as the class enrollment exceeds thirty (30) at Elementary<br/>schools in K-3 classrooms, and for the term of this Agreement only, thirty two<br/>(32) in 4-5 classrooms, thirty-six (36) at MJHS, and thirty-seven (37) at AHS.</p>
<p>If Option &quot;b&quot; is chosen by the teacher, and at a later date [not to exceed ten (10)<br/>days] the Board of Education does not approve of monetary payment as the<br/>solution, the teacher will receive payment for those days that the student was in<br/>the class prior to the Board's decision.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no volunteers for the overload student, the Association and District<br/>negotiating teams will meet to review other IBB options that would not disrupt the<br/>educational setting and try to prevent the District the cost of opening an<br/>additional class or sections.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size will be modified within the first thirty (30) days that will allow for growth<br/>at each grade level for residents of the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the District is to maintain a class size of twenty-three (23) students per<br/>teacher at Vicente Martinez High School. If the class size goes over twenty-three (23),<br/>the other provisions of the class size article relative to overload situations shall take<br/>effect.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this article shall not apply in the following;</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A change in statutory provisions or legal requirements</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental classes</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional large group classes, such as physical education, choral music,<br/>instrumental music, and drama. Class size for instrumental music will be<br/>determined by the site administrator, in collaboration with the instrumental music<br/>teacher. Freshman P.E. at Alhambra High School shall have a maximum of<br/>thirty-seven (37) students so long as the Health curriculum is being taught<br/>through P.E. classes and this method of delivery meets State Health curriculum<br/>requirements. However, other P.E. classes at Alhambra High School and<br/>Martinez Junior High shall not exceed forty-five (45) students. If there are over<br/>forty-five (45) students after the 20<sup>lfl</sup> day of school, Section 5 of this article shall</p>
<p>21-3</p>
<p>apply.</p>
<p>8. In implementing the provisions of this article on class size maximums, the Principal shall<br/>make arrangements and/or adjustments in the local school program or initiate the<br/>transfer of overload students as soon as possible. At the beginning of the school year,<br/>the Principal must resolve an overload within twenty (20) school days from the day the<br/>overload occurs. From the twenty-first (21<sup>st</sup>) day of student contact to May 1, the<br/>Principal shall resolve each overload within fifteen (15) school days of the day it occurs.<br/>The resolution of a class overload occurring after May 1 is not mandatory.</p>
<p>9 After consultation with appropriate certificated staff members, the Principal will develop<br/>any necessary combination classes and request volunteers to teach those classes. If<br/>there is no volunteer, the assignment to the combination class will be made on a rotating<br/>basis.</p>
<p>21-4</p>

<p>5f. MATERNITY LEAVE - PAID</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>Maternity leave shall be granted to pregnant employees.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>Any pregnant employee covered by this Agreement</p>
<p>22-4</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter from the employee's physician verifying pregnancy and approximate<br/>delivery date shall be filed in the Personnel Office.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have her physician verify, in writing, that period of time that<br/>she is unable to perform the functions of her assignment. For absence from duty<br/>on the contract days occurring during this period, the employee may utilize sick<br/>leave and receive compensation (e.g., differential pay) as expressed under Sick<br/>Leave, Article 22.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests for maternity leave must be approved by the Board.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity leaves may be granted without pay if requested by employee.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves of absence for pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth and recovery<br/>therefrom shall not constitute a break in service in meeting the conditions of<br/>tenure eligibility, and shall be treated as a condition of illness and shall fall under<br/>sick leave provisions.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a certificated employee shall serve seventy-five percent (75%) of the<br/>school year in order to receive credit for a full year of service for tenure and<br/>salary provisions (retirement credit relates to actual amount earned).</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an unlawful employment practice, in the absence of bona fide occupational<br/>qualifications, for school boards to discriminate against pregnant employees or<br/>applicants for employment. Examples of such unlawful practice would be<br/>discriminating in hiring, employing or terminating, selection for a training program<br/>leading to employment, reassignment or promotion, compensation, terms,<br/>conditions or privileges of employment.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written statement will be developed by the Superintendent and given to the<br/>employee prior to the maternity leave stating that the employee will return to the<br/>same assignment as held prior to the commencement of the leave. This<br/>assumes the same assignment still exists and that the leave does not exceed<br/>two (2) semesters, including the semester in which the leave is granted.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>An employee working full time for a full-contract year shall be annually entitled to ten<br/>(10) days of leave of absence for the purpose of sick leave utilization. An employee<br/>working less than full time shall be entitled to sick leave in the same ratio that their<br/>employment bears to full-time employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>An employee exercising this leave of absence provision shall notify the District of his/her<br/>need to be absent from service as soon as known. It is expected that the employee will<br/>notify the District Office in sufficient time to secure substitute services. The notification<br/>described herein shall also include an estimate of the expected duration of the absence.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements</p>
<p>An employee becoming aware of the need for absence due to surgery, maternity, or<br/>other predictable or previously scheduled cause shall submit a statement from the<br/>attending physician as far in advance of the initial disability date as possible. The<br/>physician's statement shall include the beginning date of disability, the cause of the<br/>disability, if appropriate, and the anticipated date of the return to active service. The<br/>District may require, with the approval of the Association President, and if circumstances<br/>justify, medical verification for absences of less than five (5) days.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a period not to exceed five (5) days</p>
<p>A written statement verifying absence. Such a statement shall be on forms<br/>prescribed by the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a period of over five (5) but less than thirty (30) days<br/>A written statement from a doctor verifying illness or injury.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each employee with a written statement of: (1) his/her<br/>accrued sick leave total, and (2) his/her sick leave entitlement for the school year<br/>by the last work day in August of each year during the contract period.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first ten (10) days of sick leave, an employee who continues to be<br/>absent for purposes of this policy shall be eligible to receive differential pay<br/>(difference between employee's per diem amount and the cost of the substitute)<br/>for a period not to exceed five (5) continuous school months. Any unused sick<br/>leave credit may be used by the employee for sick leave purposes without loss of<br/>compensation. In order to qualify for differential pay, an employee shall first<br/>utilize all accumulated sick leave credit and in no event shall days of differential<br/>pay when combined with days of sick leave utilization exceed one hundred ten</p>
<p>(110) days in any school year. Only one (1) increment of differential pay shall be<br/>allowed for any single and continuous absence that extends into the next school<br/>year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new differential pay period may be initiated for a different illness or accident<br/>within the school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to Service</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall not be allowed to return to service and shall be charged with<br/>one (1) additional day of sick leave absence if the employee fails to notify the<br/>District of intent to return to duty by 4:00 p.m. on the preceding workday; and if<br/>by such notification failure, a substitute is secured.</p>
<p>5L VOLUNTARY LEAVE - UNPAID</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for voluntary leave of absence, without compensation, may be granted<br/>by the Board based upon the value to the District, urgency of the request and the<br/>employment record of the employee making the request.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that a voluntary leave of absence is granted for the convenience<br/>of the employee. The employee granted a voluntary leave is entitled to a job in<br/>the District within the scope of his/her credential upon return.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District does not receive the written statement of the intent to return by<br/>February 1, the District will notify the employee by special service or in writing,<br/>certified mail, return receipt requested, that the employee will be deemed to have<br/>resigned unless a written statement with the intent to return is received within ten<br/>days of delivery or attempted delivery of the notice.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement will be developed by the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel and<br/>given to the employee prior to the granting of a leave as to the employee's<br/>position in the District upon return from leave.</p>
<p>22-11</p>
<p>23. Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of this Article is to provide support for any bargaining unit member or<br/>employee of the District when that employee or a member of his or her family suffers<br/>from a catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic illness or injury means an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate<br/>an employee or a member of the employee’s family for an extended period of time and<br/>which requires the employee to take extended time off work after exhaustion of all<br/>accumulated leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this agreement, all bargaining unit member employees of the Martinez Unified<br/>School District may become members of the Catastrophic Leave Bank by voluntarily<br/>contributing, on a one time basis, one (1) sick leave day for the establishment and<br/>operation of the bank. Only contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the bank. All<br/>donations of eligible leave credits to the bank are irrevocable.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual enrollment period is during the month of February. Employees who elect to<br/>join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first becoming eligible, have a waiting period of<br/>ninety (90) days after joining before they can withdraw from the bank. Eligible<br/>employees must notify the Personnel Office, using the appropriate form, of their desire to<br/>participate in the bank. New employees with more than ten (10) days of transferable<br/>sick leave days from another district may donate one (1) day of sick leave within the first<br/>thirty (30) calendar days of employment if they wish to participate. The maximum anyone<br/>can contribute to the bank is two (2) sick leave days.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cumulative number of days that any one person can be granted from the bank shall<br/>be in units of no more than thirty (30) days. Employees may submit requests for<br/>extensions of withdrawals as their prior grants expire. An employee's withdrawal from<br/>the bank may not exceed a period of twelve (12) consecutive months. Members of the<br/>bank may request to withdraw from the bank after all available leave has been<br/>exhausted and ten (10) days of differential pay have been received. A member who<br/>withdraws credits from the bank will be paid at his/her regular daily rate of pay.<br/>Catastrophic Leave will not be granted for periods of disability when monies are being<br/>paid to the unit member under Worker’s Compensation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee will be established to review and either approve<br/>or deny all requests. The Committee will consist of one (1) administrator and one (1)<br/>member of the Martinez Education Association.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave applicants must make application through the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank Committee by completing the appropriate form. Employees applying to withdraw<br/>credits or extend Catastrophic Leave will be required to submit a doctor’s statement<br/>indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the probable length of absence from<br/>work. Members of the committee shall keep information regarding the nature of the<br/>illness confidential. If an employee has drawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank days<br/>and requests an extension, the committee may require a medical review by a physician<br/>of the committee’s choice at the employee's expense. When the Catastrophic Leave<br/>has ended, employees shall donate one (1) day to the bank when it becomes available<br/>to the employee.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 15 of each school year, the District shall notify the committee of the<br/>following:</p>
<p>23-1</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of accumulated days in the bank on June 30 of the previous<br/>year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days contributed by employees for the current year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of participating employees.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days available in the bank.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once membership in the bank is established, membership continues from year-to-year<br/>unless the member notifies the Personnel Office, in writing, of their intent to withdraw<br/>from the bank. Such withdrawal from the bank must occur during the February<br/>enrollment period or when additional days are solicited to replenish the bank and will not<br/>result in reinstatement of the time contributed to the bank.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unused days contributed to the bank will be carried over from year-to-year. When the<br/>total number of days in the bank is reduced to thirty (30) days or less, the committee will<br/>inform the Catastrophic Leave Bank membership that a special assessment of one (1)<br/>sick leave day per member will be made to replenish the bank.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of participation in the bank will be included in the annual sick leave<br/>accounting update provided by the district to each employee.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the<br/>bank shall be returned to current members of the bank proportionately.</p>
<p>23-2</p>
<p>13. MARTINEZ UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>CATASTROPHIC LEAVE BANK REQUEST FOR WITHDRAWAL</p>
<p>This bank may be drawn upon by district employees who have exhausted all paid leave as a<br/>result of the catastrophic illness or injury of the employee, or the employee’s family member.</p>
<p>The amount of leave drawn from the bank by an applicant shall be approved by a majority of the<br/>members of the Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the above provisions and the provisions outlined in the Catastrophic Leave Article in</p>
<p>all bargaining unit contracts, I request that_days &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be withdrawn from the bank</p>
