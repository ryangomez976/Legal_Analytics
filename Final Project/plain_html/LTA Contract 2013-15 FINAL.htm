Should the unit member disagree with the rationale for the<br/>transfer (using criteria established in Section 9.5(1)), the member can submit<br/>a rebuttal and request a meeting with the Superintendent.</p>
<p>(1) Should the unit member object to the transfer, a conference will be<br/>held, within five (5) days of receipt of the objection, with the<br/>Supervisor and a Representative designated by the Superintendent<br/>to resolve the matter. The Association shall have the right to have a</p>
<p>Page | 19</p>
<p>representative present at this conference if requested by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>(2) Should the unit member still object to the transfer after the second<br/>conference, the District shall have the discretion to implement the<br/>transfer over the objections of the unit member, provided the<br/>District has confirmed, in writing, the reason originally given for the<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal circumstances, a unit member who is to be involuntarily</p>
<p>administratively transferred or reassigned for the following trimester or<br/>school year shall be notified of the change at least twenty (20) days prior to<br/>the end of the current trimester or school year. Unusual circumstances<br/>include, by way of illustration and not limitation, unanticipated: summer<br/>retirements, enrollment fluctuations, and budget reductions.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher who is involuntarily moved to a different grade and keeps<br/>the same classroom will be compensated at his/her daily rate for one<br/>day.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher who is involuntarily reassigned to a different classroom<br/>will be compensated his/her daily rate for four (4) days.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher who is involuntarily transferred to a different school will<br/>be compensated his/her daily rate for four (4) days.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher is involuntarily transferred/reassigned to a different grade<br/>level they will be provided two (2) release days to meet with and/or<br/>observe other classroom teachers. The release days and selected<br/>classroom teachers must be mutually agreed on by the teacher and<br/>his/her principal.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the District shall provide packing supplies, packing and<br/>moving of materials.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absent unusual circumstances, the affected employee will not be<br/>referred to the assistance phase during the first year of transfer for<br/>practice not consistent with minimum CSTP standards. Evaluation may<br/>be requested by the teacher. This does not apply to probationary<br/>teachers; nor is the intent to preclude observation and assistance.</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is involuntarily transferred/reassigned they may not<br/>be involuntarily transferred two (2) consecutive years except for<br/>section 9.6 #1-9.</p>
<p>Page | 20</p>
<p>9.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In situations where an administrative transfer/reassignment is made in order<br/>to fill a vacancy, the District shall consider the following factors when<br/>selecting a person to be transferred/reassigned:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall teaching experience.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized skills and talents.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional participation.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credentials.</p>
<p>9.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When two (2) or more unit members are considered equal after applying the<br/>above-factors, the District shall recommend the unit member with the least<br/>seniority. Any tie in seniority shall be resolved by lottery.</p>
<p>9.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member being administratively transferred/reassigned shall be given<br/>serious consideration for any subsequent vacancy prior to consideration of<br/>voluntary transfer/reassignment requests if one (1) or more vacancies exist<br/>and the unit member requests said consideration.</p>
<p>9.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrative transfer/reassignment shall not be punitive or disciplinary<br/>in nature.</p>
<p>9.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members returning from leave shall be afforded all rights provided under<br/>this article.</p>

<p>10.8</p>
<p>Alternative Evaluation</p>
<p>The District and the Loomis Teachers Association (LTA) share the belief<br/>that offering alternatives to the traditional evaluation system will improve<br/>excellence in instruction by promoting the professional growth of<br/>experienced teachers.</p>
<p>10.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants</p>
<p>The following certificated personnel will be eligible to participate in<br/>an alternative evaluation system:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All permanent certificated employees.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation will be voluntary by the permanent certificated<br/>unit member with the approval of the Site Administrator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no limit on the number of participants at each<br/>site</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative evaluation option, if mutually agreed upon,<br/>shall take the place of the traditional evaluation methods as<br/>outlined in Article 10 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers whose participation in the alternative evaluation<br/>program is judged to detract from the teacher's instructional<br/>and professional performance may be reassigned during the<br/>year to the traditional evaluation process as outlined in<br/>Article 10 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between<br/>the District and LTA.</p>
<p>f Teachers who do solely online instruction must do Alternative<br/>Evaluation.</p>
<p>10.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal Setting</p>
<p>The certificated employee will develop goals as the foundation for<br/>his/her alternative evaluation option. During the goal setting<br/>conference, the Site Administrator and the certificated employee<br/>will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree on the goals and the selection of the alternative<br/>evaluation option.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop timelines for completion.</p>
<p>Page | 26</p>
<p>c. Review how the alternative evaluation option will enhance<br/>student learning.</p>
<p>10.8.3 Alternative Evaluation Options</p>
<p>The certificated employee should select alternative evaluation</p>
<p>options which are in close alignment with his/her annual goals. The</p>
<p>District wide approved alternative options may include but are not</p>
<p>limited to the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare and analyze a portfolio of three students' work<br/>correlated to the teacher's goal. Share the analysis with the<br/>Administrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare a teacher portfolio correlated to the teacher's goal.<br/>Share the analysis with the Administrator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analyze a video tape of a lesson you have taught and share<br/>video and analysis with administrator.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a standards based unit with activities, resources,<br/>pacing guide, and criterion for evaluation, and carry it<br/>through the process.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentor a colleague through the BTSA or Peer Assistance<br/>Review process. Documentation of this activity shall include<br/>teacher's own personal learning from being a coach and its<br/>application to the CSTP.</p>
<p>f Teachers may also form a collaborative learning group</p>
<p>including teachers, staff, and/or Administrators. The group<br/>will meet to discuss teachers focus questions, educational<br/>growth areas, curricular programs, and teaching practices.<br/>The meetings will be held multiple times throughout the<br/>school year and the findings will be shared with the<br/>Administrator at the end of the year.</p>
<p>10.8.4 Collaboration</p>
<p>The District and LTA believe the most effective professional growth<br/>occurs through collaboration.</p>
<p>The teacher and the Site Administrator will work together in the<br/>selection of the options and the development of the specific<br/>activities.</p>
<p>Page | 27</p>
<p>All participants in the alternative evaluation option will be<br/>encouraged to share the progress and results of their alternative<br/>individual or educational team activities with other colleagues. The<br/>time and format for this collaboration will be developed at each<br/>individual site.</p>
<p>10.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines</p>
<p>The certificated employee will submit written alternative evaluation<br/>plan/goals. Timelines are to be predetermined by the participants<br/>and the Site Administrator.</p>
<p>10.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Report</p>
<p>Prior to the end of the year, the teacher and administrator will<br/>meet to review the progress of the selected teacher activities. Both<br/>the teacher and the Administrator will provide a written response.<br/>Upon satisfactory completion of the selected activities, a form<br/>indicating completion of the alternative evaluation plan and<br/>meeting District standards will be included in the personnel file.</p>
<p>10.9 Personnel File Contents and Inspection</p>
<p>10.9.1 Materials in personnel files of unit members which may serve as a<br/>basis for affecting the status of their employment are to be made<br/>available for the inspection of the person involved.</p>
<p>Such material is not to include ratings, reports, or records which:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were obtained prior to the employment of the person<br/>involved;</p>

<p>Page | 28</p>
<p>10.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every unit member shall have the right to inspect such materials<br/>upon request, provided that the request is made at a time when<br/>such person is not actually required to render services to the<br/>employing district.</p>
<p>10.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature, except material mentioned in<br/>the second paragraph of this section, shall not be entered or filed<br/>unless and until the unit member is given notice and an opportunity<br/>to review and comment thereon. A unit member shall have the<br/>right to enter and have attached to any such derogatory statement,<br/>his/her own comments thereon. Such review shall take place during<br/>normal business hours, and the unit member shall be released from<br/>duty for this purpose without salary reduction.</p>
<p>10.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a unit member demands a hearing after having been<br/>served with a notice of the District's intention to dismiss, evidence<br/>of records regularly kept by the District concerning the unit<br/>member may be introduced; but no decision relating to the<br/>dismissal or suspension of any unit member shall be made based on<br/>charges or evidences of any nature relating to matters occurring<br/>more than four (4) years prior to the filing of the notice.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>13.1</p>
<p>13.2</p>
<p>13.3</p>
<p>13.4</p>
<p>13.5</p>
<p>(See Article III for definitions of &quot;grievance&quot;, &quot;grievant&quot;, and &quot;day&quot;)</p>
<p>The purpose of the procedure is to attempt to secure equitable solutions to<br/>grievances at the lowest possible level. All parties agree that these procedures<br/>will be kept formal and confidential.</p>
<p>Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>grievant to discuss a grievance informally with his/her immediate Supervisor,<br/>or to have the grievance adjusted, prior to Level III, without intervention of<br/>the LTA, provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of<br/>this Agreement. Any proposed resolution at Levels II or III shall not be agreed<br/>upon by the District until the LTA has been provided a copy of the written<br/>grievance and of the proposed resolution and been allowed an opportunity to<br/>respond.</p>
<p>All time periods specified within this Article shall be considered maximums;<br/>however, nothing prevents the parties from extending the time limit by<br/>mutual consent.</p>
<p>A formal grievance, when initiated, shall be in writing on an approved form<br/>(Appendix E), and shall be filed with the Site Administrator. The form shall be<br/>mutually developed and approved by the LTA and the District to show the<br/>following:</p>

<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remedy sought by the grievant; and</p>
<p>g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signature of the grievant.</p>
<p>Page | 40</p>
<p>In processing grievances, the parties will make a good faith effort to avoid<br/>interruption of normal services to District operations.</p>
<p>LEVEL I</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Initiation of Grievance. The grievant shall first discuss the grievance<br/>with his/her Site Administrator with the objective of resolving the matter<br/>informally. This shall occur within fifteen (15) days of when the grievant<br/>learned of the alleged grievable occurrence of action.</p>
<p>13.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Initiation of Grievance. If the grievant is not satisfied with the informal<br/>disposition of the grievance, he/she may communicate the grievance in<br/>writing to his/her Site Administrator within ten (10) days of the informal<br/>meeting. The Site Administrator shall make a written decision and attach it to<br/>the original written grievance with a copy sent to the grievant within ten (10)<br/>days of receipt of the written grievance.</p>
<p>Level II</p>
<p>13.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision of the Site Administrator,<br/>he/she may appeal to the Superintendent in writing within ten (10) days of<br/>the decision rendered and include a statement of the reasons for the appeal.<br/>Appeals to the Superintendent shall be heard by the Superintendent or<br/>designee within ten (10) days of receipt of the appeal.

The Board shall review the grievance within thirty (30) days and<br/>sustain, deny, or otherwise modify the Superintendent's decision.</p>
<p>Level IV</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant and/or the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of<br/>the grievance or if no disposition has occurred within forty (40) days after<br/>appeal to Level III, the grievant may request the Association to submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>13.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association proceeds to arbitration, it shall notify the District in writing<br/>within ten (10) days after the Level III decision, or within forty (40) days after</p>

The selection of the<br/>arbitrator and the arbitration proceeding shall be conducted under the<br/>Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>The arbitrator's decision will be in writing and will set forth the findings of<br/>fact, reasoning, and conclusions of the issues submitted. The arbitrator shall<br/>have no power to add to, to subtract from, or to change any of the terms or<br/>provisions of this Agreement. Jurisdiction shall extend solely to claims of<br/>violations of specific written provisions of the Agreement and involve only the<br/>interpretation and application of the Agreement. The decision and award shall<br/>be based upon the joint submission agreement of the parties with respect to<br/>the specific interpretation and application of the Agreement. In the absence<br/>of an agreed-upon joint submission agreement, the arbitrator may formulate<br/>the issue or issues to be decided after hearing from each of the parties in the<br/>presence of the other party. The decision of the arbitrator will be submitted<br/>to the Association and to the Superintendent and will be final and binding<br/>upon the parties. If any question arises as to the grievance, such question will<br/>be ruled upon at the arbitrator's discretion.</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to, per<br/>diem expenses, his/her travel and subsistence expense and the cost of any<br/>hearing room, will be borne equally by the Board and the Association. All<br/>other costs, except for release time for the grievant(s), Association<br/>representatives, and witnesses, will be borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>TIME LIMITS</p>
<p>Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day following receipt of<br/>the grievance, grievance appeal, or written decision.</p>
<p>Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the<br/>time limits specified at each level should be considered to be maximums and<br/>every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits may,<br/>however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>

<p>13.17</p>
<p>13.18</p>
<p>13.19</p>
<p>13.20</p>
<p>13.21</p>
<p>In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this procedure by the end of the school year and, if<br/>left unresolved until the beginning of the following school year could result in<br/>harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein will be reduced<br/>so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or<br/>as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p>RIGHTS OF REPRESENTATION</p>
<p>A unit member alleging a grievance may be represented at all stages of the<br/>grievance procedure by himself/herself or, at the grievant's option, by an<br/>Association-designated representative. Except for health reasons, the grievant<br/>shall be present in conference at all levels.</p>
<p>NO REPRISALS</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by any<br/>member or representative of the administration or the Board against any<br/>aggrieved party, any party in interest, any member of the Association, or any<br/>other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>MISCELLANEOUS</p>
<p>The Association, either in its own behalf, or in behalf of the affected teachers,<br/>may initiate a grievance which affects more than one (1) unit member at Level<br/>II.</p>
<p>Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal a grievance to the next step<br/>within the specified time limits shall preclude any further appeal on the<br/>grievance. Failure by the District to respond within the specified time limits<br/>shall authorize the grievant to proceed to the next step in the procedure.</p>
<p>The filing of a grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the District<br/>to proceed in carrying out its administrative responsibilities Subject to the<br/>final resolution of the grievance. In the event the alleged grievance involves<br/>an order, requirement, or other directive, the grievant shall fulfill or carry out<br/>such order, requirement, or other directive pending the final resolution of the<br/>grievance, except where unusual or abnormal safety hazards have been<br/>determined to exist.</p>

<p>The teacher shall notify the Superintendent in writing of the projected date<br/>on which the leave is expected to commence and the probable date on which<br/>the teacher shall resume duties, such notice to be given not less than thirty<br/>(30) days prior to the expected commencement date of such leave. The<br/>Superintendent shall waive such notice upon receipt of a request from the<br/>teacher's physician stating that such leave must commence for medical<br/>reasons less than thirty (30) days from the date of notice.</p>

<p>Under current California law, teachers are not exempt from jury duty.</p>
<p>When called for jury duty or for attendance in a court of civil or criminal<br/>proceeding when the teacher is not a party litigant, the employee will be<br/>granted a leave of absence with pay.</p>
<p>Teachers receiving compensation for jury or court duty shall submit to the<br/>District their jury warrant(s), excluding mileage and meals.</p>
<p>Compensation from jury or court duty not requiring leave from regular<br/>assigned hours shall not be paid to the District.</p>
<p>INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT &amp; ILLNESS LEAVE</p>
<p>A teacher who is absent from duty because of an illness or injury defined as<br/>an industrial accident or industrial illness under provisions of the Worker's<br/>Compensation Insurance Law shall be granted paid Industrial Accident and<br/>Illness Leave for each such accident or illness. This paid leave applies while the<br/>teacher is receiving temporary disability benefits from Worker's<br/>Compensation. The provisions of the paid Industrial Accident and Illness Leave<br/>are described below.</p>
<p>When an industrial accident or illness occurs at a time when the full sixty (60)<br/>days will overlap into the next fiscal year, the teachers shall be entitled to only<br/>that amount remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the injury or<br/>illness occurred for the same illness or injury; the allowable leave shall not be<br/>accumulative from year-to-year.</p>
<p>Industrial Accident or Illness Leave will commence on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>Payment for wages lost on any day shall not exceed the normal wage for the<br/>day, when added to an award granted the staff member under the Worker's<br/>Compensation laws of this State.</p>
<p>Industrial Accident Leave will be reduced by one (1) day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of a compensation award made under<br/>Worker's Compensation.</p>

<p>When entitlement to Industrial Accident or Illness leave has been exhausted,<br/>entitlement to other sick leave will then be used, but if any teacher is<br/>receiving Worker's Compensation, the teacher shall be entitled to use only so<br/>much of the teacher's accumulated or available sick leave, accumulated<br/>compensating time, vacation, or available leave which, when added to the<br/>Worker's Compensation award, provide for a full day's wage or salary.</p>
<p>The Board may, by rule or regulation, provide for such additional leave of<br/>absence, paid or unpaid, as it deems appropriate; and during such leave the<br/>teacher may return to the teacher's position without suffering any loss of<br/>status or benefits.</p>
<p>During all paid leaves of absence, whether Industrial Accident Leave as<br/>provided in this section, Sick Leave, Vacation, compensated time-off or other<br/>available leave provided by law or the action of the Board, the teacher shall<br/>endorse to the District wage loss benefit checks received under the Worker's<br/>Compensation Laws of the State. The District, in turn, shall issue the teacher<br/>appropriate warrants for payment of wages or salary and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>When all available leaves of absence, paid or unpaid, have been exhausted<br/>and if the teacher is not medically able to resume the duties of the teacher's<br/>position, the teacher shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a re¬<br/>employment list for a period of thirty-nine (39) months. Where available,<br/>during the thirty-nine (39) month period, the teacher shall be employed in a<br/>vacant position in the class of the teacher's previous assignment over all other<br/>available candidates except for a re-employment list established because of a<br/>lack of work or funds, in which case the teacher shall be listed in accordance<br/>with appropriate seniority regulations.</p>
<p>Any teacher receiving benefits as a result of this Section shall, during the<br/>period of injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless the<br/>Board authorizes travel outside the state.</p>
<p>A teacher who has been placed on a re-employment list as provided herein,<br/>who has been medically released for return to duty and who fails to accept<br/>any appropriate assignment shall be deemed to have resigned.</p>
<p>OTHER LEAVES</p>
<p>14.38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board, upon a written request stating in full the teacher's reasons, may grant<br/>paid or unpaid leaves. These leaves may include but would not be limited to<br/>those involving study, temporary leave without pay for up to one (1) year, and for<br/>in-service.</p>
<p>14.39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher's request must be filed at least thirty (30) days prior to the<br/>commencement of the desired leave; this provision could be waived in case of<br/>personal emergency.</p>
<p>14.40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may grant, providing the District's insurance carrier(s) have no<br/>restrictions, a continuation of benefits to the teacher at his/her cost. If the leave<br/>granted is paid, the teacher shall not suffer a break in service. Neither shall<br/>he/she lose annual increment credit if he/she has worked seventy-five percent<br/>(75%) of the year or more.</p>

<p>FRINGE BENEFITS</p>
<p>16.24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher benefits are set forth in Appendix C-l and Appendix C-2. The master</p>
<p>contract between the District and the insurance carriers through the Joint<br/>Powers Agreement, School Insurance Group (SIG) are on file in the District<br/>Office and are available for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inspection.</p>
<p>16.25 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan Limitations</p>
<p>Eligible employees are restricted in choosing only those plans made available<br/>by SIG and are further restricted in choosing only those plans made available<br/>by the collective bargaining agreement. Eligibility is determined by SIG, the<br/>insurance carrier, and this contract. Enrollment, including new family<br/>members, will be in accordance with SIG rules. Failure to properly follow<br/>these rules may result in the employee having to wait until the next available<br/>period for coverage.</p>

<p>COBRA</p>
<p>The parties agree that current employees, once they have terminated<br/>employment, according to PL 272 (COBRA) may continue the benefits agreed<br/>to in this article in accordance with Law, SIG, and District procedures.</p>
<p>MEDICARE COVERAGE</p>
<p>The parties agree to provide an election (hereinafter &quot;Division&quot;) so that<br/>current employees who were eligible for coverage under the State Teachers<br/>Retirement System (STRS) as of March 31,1986 and who have not otherwise<br/>been mandated into Medicare coverage, may elect whether or not they wish<br/>to have contributions made by them and on their behalf for purposes of<br/>establishing eligibility for Medicare coverage.</p>
<p>After June 3, 1993, the Governing Board shall pass an appropriate resolution<br/>indicating its intent to offer &quot;Medicare only&quot; coverage for eligible employees<br/>pursuant to appropriate procedures for conducting a Division; and, thereafter,<br/>the Governing Board will enter into an appropriate agreement or amendment<br/>to agreement with the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) allowing<br/>for the provision of &quot;Medicare only&quot; coverage for eligible employees who<br/>have elected such coverage.</p>
<p>The parties understand that the election is on a one (1) time only basis.</p>
<p>For employees electing &quot;Medicare Only&quot; coverage, the District will contribute<br/>an amount equal to one point four-five percent (1.45%) of monthly or tenthly<br/>wages until such time as the employee's annual salary for that year has been<br/>paid or has reached the statutory maximum, whichever occurs first. A<br/>matching one point four-five percent (1.45%) of wages shall be deducted from<br/>the employee's salary for purposes of contributing to eligibility for &quot;Medicare<br/>Only&quot; coverage. The District's contribution shall not exceed one point four-<br/>five percent (1.45%) and any increase in the employer-required contribution<br/>shall be assumed by the employee unless and until negotiated otherwise.</p>
<p>Contributions began November 1, 1993 pay period. By so doing, the parties<br/>intend to provide four (4) quarters' coverage for that calendar year in light of<br/>their current understanding that contributions based upon Two Thousand<br/>Eighty Dollars ($2,080) of covered earnings will provide four (4) quarters</p>
<p>toward eligibility in anyone (1) calendar year. Neither the Association nor the<br/>District assumes any liability or responsibility in the event that fewer than four</p>
<p>(4) quarters are generated as a result of beginning contributions effective<br/>November 1, 1993.</p>
<p>16.32 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize that final State and Federal approval of the necessary<br/>agreements may be as far away as a year to eighteen (18) months following<br/>ratification of this Agreement. Accordingly, the parties agree, if necessary, to<br/>escrow the deductions and contributions described in Article 16.30 above<br/>until such time as final approval requires such past and future contributions to<br/>be forwarded directly to the Social Security System. Any interest accruing to<br/>such escrow account shall be applied toward the District's contribution to pay<br/>and reimburse PERS for the administrative costs which may periodically be<br/>billed to the District. After such interest is exhausted, the District will assume<br/>sole responsibility for payment of such costs.</p>

Questions arising as to the application and/or interpretation of this<br/>clause shall be specifically excluded from the grievance/arbitration clause of<br/>this collectively negotiated Agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;Catastrophic illness or injury&quot; is defined as an illness or injury that<br/>is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of<br/>time or that incapacitates a member of the employee's family<br/>which incapacity requires the employee to take time off from work<br/>for an extended period of time to care for that family member and<br/>taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the<br/>employee because he/she has exhausted all his/her sick leave and<br/>other paid time off, excluding differential leave,</p></td></tr>

<p>All unit members on active duty with the District are eligible to</p></td></tr>

<p>c)</p></td><td>
<p>Unit members who elect not to join the Bank upon first becoming<br/>eligible must wait until the next date of assessed contribution (See</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>below Section 21.2 g.) and then must contribute at least two (2)<br/>days of sick leave or the actual assessment, whichever is greater.<br/>The contribution, on the appropriate form, shall be authorized by<br/>the unit member and continued from year to year until canceled by<br/>the unit member</p>
<p>Cancellation occurs automatically whenever a unit member fails to<br/>make his/her contribution or assessment. Cancellation, on the<br/>proper form, may be effected at any time and the unit member<br/>shall not be eligible to draw from the Bank as of the effective date<br/>of cancellation. Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to<br/>the Bank shall not be returned if the unit member effects<br/>cancellation.</p>
<p>Contributions shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each<br/>school year. Unit members returning from extended leave which<br/>included the enrollment period and new hires will be permitted to<br/>contribute within thirty (30) calendar days of beginning work. The<br/>District shall supply enrollment forms for the Bank to all new unit<br/>members and those unit members returning from leave. ***ln time<br/>of special need, and pursuant to the Committee's approval, any unit<br/>member may contribute to the bank during the school year.</p>
<p>Unit members wishing to participate in the Bank shall make an<br/>initial contribution of two (2) days the first year of participation.<br/>Part-time employees will have their contribution prorated, After the<br/>employee's initial year of participation in the Bank, annual<br/>contribution will be (1) day of sick leave. (Ed. Code 44043.5)</p>
<p>An additional day will be required of Bank members if the number<br/>of days in the Bank falls below the number of members in the Bank.<br/>Bank participants who are drawing from the Bank at the time of the<br/>assessment will not be required to contribute to remain eligible to<br/>draw from the Bank. If a Bank participant has no remaining sick<br/>leave at the time of the assessment, he/she need not contribute<br/>the additional day(s) to remain a participant in the Bank.</p>
<p>If the number of days in the Bank at the beginning of a school year<br/>exceeds 200 days, no contribution shall be required of returning<br/>unit members. Those unit members joining the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank for the first time and those returning from leave shall be<br/>required to contribute one day to the Bank.</p>
<p>21.3</p>
<p>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE BANK</p>
<p>Bank participants whose sick leave is exhausted may request a withdrawal</p>
<p>from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who have exhausted sick leave and other paid time off,</p>
<p>but still have differential leave available, are eligible for a<br/>withdrawal from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten (10) duty days of illness or disability must be covered<br/>by the participant's own sick leave, differential leave, or leave<br/>without pay the first time the participant qualifies for a withdrawal<br/>from the Bank. For subsequent withdrawals within twelve (12)<br/>consecutive months for any unrelated catastrophic illness, the first<br/>five (5) duty days of illness must be covered by the participants own<br/>sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant is incapacitated, applications may be submitted to<br/>the Committee by the participant's agent or member of the<br/>participant's family.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Bank shall be granted in units of no more</p>
<p>than thirty (30) duty days. Participants may submit requests for<br/>extensions of withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A<br/>participant's withdrawal from the Bank may not exceed the<br/>statutory maximum period of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from</p>
<p>the Bank will be required to submit a doctor’s statement indicating<br/>the nature of the illness or injury and the probable length of<br/>absence from work. Members of the Committee shall keep<br/>information regarding the nature of the illness confidential. A<br/>participant's withdrawal may not exceed the statutory maximum<br/>period of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant has drawn thirty (30) Bank days and requests an<br/>extension, the Committee may require a medical review by a<br/>physician of the Committee's choice at the participant's expense.<br/>The Committee shall choose only a physician who qualifies under<br/>the District-offered insurance policy. Refusal to submit to the<br/>medical review will terminate the participant's continued<br/>withdrawal from the Bank. The Committee may deny an extension<br/>of withdrawal from the Bank based upon the medical report.</p>
<p>g) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which<br/>qualifies the participant for Workers' Compensation benefits unless</p>
<p>Page | 70</p>
<p>the participant has exhausted all Workers’ Compensation leave,<br/>his/her own sick leave, and provided further that the member signs<br/>over any Workers' Compensation checks for temporary benefits to<br/>the District. If there are any Workers' Compensation checks signed<br/>over to the Board, the Bank will not be charged days, or if charged,<br/>will be reimbursed the number of days for which the Workers'<br/>Compensation payment is equivalent to a regular day of pay at the<br/>negotiated rate for that participant. If the District challenges the<br/>Workers' Compensation claim, the participant may draw from the<br/>Bank, but upon settlement of the claim in favor of the employee,<br/>the Bank shall be reimbursed the days by the District.</p>
<p>h) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Committee may reasonably presume that the applicant</p>
<p>for a draw may be eligible for a Disability Award or a Retirement<br/>under STRS or, if applicable, Social Security, the Committee may<br/>request that the draw applicant apply for disability or retirement.<br/>Failure of the draw applicant to submit a complete application,<br/>including medical information provided by the applicant’s physician,<br/>within twenty (20) calendar days will disqualify the draw applicant<br/>from further Bank payments. Any requests for additional medical<br/>information from STRS or Social Security shall be submitted within<br/>ten (10) days or the participant's entitlement to Bank payments<br/>shall cease. If denied benefits by STRS or Social Security, the<br/>applicant must appeal or entitlement to the Bank shall cease.</p>
<p>i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal<br/>request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide days and<br/>the District is under no obligation to pay the participant any funds<br/>whatsoever. If the Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or<br/>an extension of withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the<br/>request, they shall notify the participant, in writing, of the reason<br/>for the denial.</p>
<p>j) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become effective immediately upon the</p>
<p>exhaustion of sick leave and the waiting period provided for in<br/>Sections 21.2 c, 21.2 f, and 21.3 b, whichever is greater. For<br/>example, if a participant contributed when first eligible to<br/>contribute (Section 21.2 f) and had ten (10) days of accumulated<br/>sick leave when the illness began (Section 21.3 b), he/she shall<br/>begin withdrawing upon the eleventh (11th) duty day, if otherwise<br/>eligible. If the participant had fifteen (15) days of sick leave at the<br/>beginning of the illness, he/she shall begin withdrawing days on the<br/>sixteenth (16th) duty day. If the participant had five (5) days of sick</p>
<p>Page | 71</p>
<p>leave at the beginning of the illness, he/she shall begin withdrawing<br/>days on the eleventh (11<sup>th</sup>} duty day.</p>
<p>21.4 Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall have the responsibility of maintaining the<br/>records of the Bank, receiving withdrawal requests, verifying the<br/>validity of requests, approving or denying the requests, and<br/>communicating its decisions, in writing, to the participants.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's authority shall be limited to administration of the<br/>Bank. The Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests<br/>complying with the terms of this Article.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reviewed and decisions of the Committee</p>
<p>reported to the applicant, in writing, within ten (10) duty days of<br/>receipt of the application.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not<br/>disclose the nature of the illness except as is necessary to process<br/>the request for withdrawal and defend against any appeals of<br/>denials.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 5 of each school year except 2010/11 school year, the<br/>District shall notify the Committee of the following</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of accumulated days in the Bank on June<br/>30th of the previous school year.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days contributed by unit members for the<br/>current year.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of participating unit members.</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days available in the Bank.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tenth (10th) day of each calendar month, the District shall<br/>notify the Committee of the following:</p>

<p>Page | 72</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of unit members who have cancelled<br/>participation.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days in the Bank at the beginning of the<br/>previous month.</p>

<p>v. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days awarded during the previous<br/>month and to whom they were awarded</p>
<p>vi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days remaining in the bank on the last<br/>day of the month.</p>
<p>21.5 If the Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the Bank shall<br/>be returned to the then current members of the Bank proportionately.</p>
