<p>SECTION F: Part-time Health Benefits</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees and the certificated bargaining unit agree that health benefits given to full<br/>time teachers shall be offered to part time teachers with the following conditions and restrictions: The<br/>board and the certificated unit agree that the only intent of this section is to allow part time teachers to<br/>participate in the health insurance program and in no way gives or implies an entitlement to any monetary<br/>or other benefit to any part time teacher who elects to not take insurance.</p>

<p>(For example, if a part time teacher is contracted for 75% of the school year and the benefit<br/>limit is $11,000, the teacherwould be entitled to a total district contribution of .75 X $11,000 =<br/>$8,250 toward health benefits-October 1, 2013- September 30, 2014).</p>

The time limits specified may, however, be extended<br/>by mutual agreement; the time shall begin the day following the alleged event.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in<br/>this grievance procedure by the end of the school year that the time limits set forth herein will be<br/>reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon</p>

<p>a.
