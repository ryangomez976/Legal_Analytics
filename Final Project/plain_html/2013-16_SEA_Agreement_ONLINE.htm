<p>6.2 Health and Welfare Benefits</p>
<p>Health and Welfare Benefits are set forth in Appendix “B” attached.</p>
<p>6.2.2 District and Unit Member Shared Contribution for Health Premiums.<br/>[Modified 2007/</p>
<p>6.2.2.1 The District shall assume and pay for the cost of dental,<br/>vision and life insurance benefits, for the employee only,<br/>provided in the Agreement through the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>6.2.2.2 The District shall assume and pay for the full cost of health</p>
<p>(medical) insurance benefits provided in the Agreement, together with<br/>employee automatic payroll deductions as necessary, through<br/>December 31,2014, for health insurance premiums as follows:</p>
<p>6.2.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall assume and pay for the full cost of<br/>health (medical) insurance benefits provided in the<br/>Agreement for the employee only, prorated for part-<br/>time employees who work at least half-time.</p>
<p>6.2.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall assume and pay for seventy percent<br/>(70%) of the full cost of health (medical) insurance<br/>benefits provided in the Agreement for the employee’s<br/>dependents (i.e., one dependent or family coverage).</p>
<p>The employee shall contribute the remaining thirty<br/>percent (30%) of the cost of dependent coverage<br/>through automatic payroll deduction.</p>
<p>6.2.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For eligible part-time employees (see section 6.2.2.2.1),<br/>the District’s 70% contribution level shall be prorated<br/>by the same percentage representing the part-time<br/>employee’s full-time equivalency (FTE). For example:</p>
<p>For a half-time (.5 FTE or 50% employee), the District<br/>would assume and pay for one-half the cost of the<br/>employee’s own health premium and one-half of the<br/>70% contribution for dependent coverage (equal to<br/>35% of the cost of dependent coverage). The employee<br/>would contribute one-half his/her employee health<br/>premium, and the remaining 65% of the premium for<br/>dependent coverage.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>6.22.2 A The parties agree that their common interest is to</p>
<p>contain the overall cost of health and welfare benefits<br/>while preserving a quality health plan. Accordingly,<br/>the parties acknowledge and agree that, depending on<br/>the demographics of the bargaining unit regarding<br/>health coverage (employee only and dependent<br/>coverage), aggregate cost savings may be achieved by<br/>changing the manner or design by which premiums<br/>are assessed and paid to the insurance carriers, i.e.,<br/>composite or tiered rate structures. The parties agree it is<br/>in their mutual interest to maximize cost savings in this<br/>manner. The District will collaborate and consult with<br/>the Association through the Health and Welfare<br/>Insurance Committee prior to deciding to implement<br/>changes in premium design.</p>
<p>6.2.2.2.5 The parties agree to pursue aggressively changes in</p>
<p>plan design, e.g., co-pays, deductibles, prescription co¬<br/>pay configurations, etc., so as to contain, mitigate and<br/>offset increases in health and welfare benefit<br/>premiums. Such changes shall be explored through<br/>the Health and Welfare Insurance Committee, which<br/>shall issue recommendations to the District and<br/>bargaining units for consideration and potential<br/>adoption.</p>
<p>6.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member who works less than full time but at least half time, shall have his<br/>benefits pro-rated.</p>
<p>6.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who have been RIF’d shall have their health and welfare benefits paid<br/>for by the District until September 30 of the year in which they are RIF’d.</p>
<p>This provision expresses the full and complete understanding between the parties<br/>with respect to the subject of the economic effect of a RIF of employees occurring<br/>during the term of the Agreement.</p>
<p>6.3 Miscellaneous Compensation</p>
<p>6.3.1 Per Diem - “per diem” as used in this Agreement shall mean the unit member’s<br/>annual salary divided by the total number of work days.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members assigned additional work days shall be compensated on a per diem<br/>basis or receive compensatory time. This decision shall be made in collaboration<br/>between the teacher and the supervisor, with the supervisor making the final<br/>decision.</p>
<p>6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation - Certificated employees using their personal automobiles to<br/>transport students on field trips or who are assigned to more than one school per<br/>day shall be reimbursed for all such travel at the rate currently allowed by IRS<br/>Regulations for all driving done on such travel or between arrival at the first<br/>working assignment and the departure from the last assignment.</p>
<p>6.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who complete a professional growth seminar will be paid at the<br/>hourly rate of .000375 of base salary (Base salary is the first /lowest step on the<br/>teachers fully credentialed final salary. Appendix A-l), upon submitting to the<br/>District proof of completion of such seminar. “Professional Growth Seminar” shall<br/>mean a class, course, workshop, conference, or seminar which is sponsored by the<br/>District after contract hours. Unit members must submit Form “F” (Professional<br/>Growth Stipend) to the Human Resources Department on or before June 10 of the<br/>year in which the activity occurred. [Modified2000]</p>
<p>Unit members who elect to be paid for completion of a professional growth seminar<br/>shall not, simultaneously, utilize such seminar for purposes of receiving a career<br/>increment pursuant to Section 6.1.2.4.</p>
<p>6.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra Duty/Adjunct Compensation (After School Hours) [New2003/</p>
<p>All adjunct hourly pay shall be .0009 of base salary. (Base salary is the first/lowest<br/>step on the fully credentialed teacher salary schedule, Appendix A-l). This shall<br/>also be the standard for reimbursement for teachers who substitute during their<br/>preparation period.</p>
<p>See Appendix A-3 for the Adjunct Duty Stipend Chart for 2014-2015. An updated<br/>schedule will be distributed annually.</p>
<p>6.3.5.1 The parties acknowledge that unit members perform professional<br/>duties and responsibilities that do not always fall within the regular<br/>work day as defined by this Article.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>6.3.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this section is to set forth compensation, either by<br/>stipend or hourly pay (as set forth in Appendix A-3, Adjunct Stipend Chart)<br/>for some of these duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>6.3.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in committees not required by law is voluntary.</p>
<p>“Voluntary” means the decision to participate on any committee is<br/>entirely at the initiative and discretion of the teacher.</p>
<p>6.3.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow teachers to participate in committee work for the<br/>District or school site, committees are established on a District or<br/>school-wide basis. Participation on District or site committees is<br/>voluntary as defined in this Article.</p>
<p>6.3.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to receive the stipend provided in Appendix A-3, teachers<br/>must attend at least 80% of all scheduled meetings of each committee for<br/>which they volunteer, and remain in attendance for at least 80% of the<br/>schedules duration of each meeting. Attendance records will be maintained.</p>
<p>6.3.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written prior approval by an administrator of assignment to a<br/>committee, adjunct duty or other activity listed on Appendix A-3 is<br/>necessary to receive the stipend or hourly compensation for such<br/>activity. If it is a District sponsored workshop, prior approval by a<br/>principal is not necessary.</p>
<p>6.3.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that we will annually review the aggregate cost of<br/>adjunct duty compensation.</p>

The employer shall not<br/>agree to a resolution of the grievance until the exclusive representative has received a copy<br/>of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a<br/>response.</p>
<p>7.3 Procedure</p>
<p>Level I - School Principal or Immediate Supervisor</p>
<p>7.3.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance will first be discussed with the Principal, or immediate supervisor of<br/>the aggrieved, with the objective of resolving the matter informally. The aggrieved<br/>and/or the immediate supervisor may have not more than two (2) representatives<br/>present with him at this informal meeting.</p>
<p>7.3.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition of the</p>
<p>grievance, he may submit the claim as a formal grievance in writing to the<br/>Principal. If the aggrieved has not filed a claim within the ten (10) days after<br/>speaking with the Principal informally, the grievance will be deemed to have been<br/>waived. If a formal grievance has been filed, the aggrieved may: (1) discuss the<br/>grievance personally; (2) request that a representative(s) accompany him; or (3)<br/>request that a representative(s) act(s) on his behalf (See Section 7.4.7 regarding<br/>forms).</p>
<p>7.3.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days after receipt of the written grievance by the Principal,</p>
<p>the Principal or his designee shall meet with the aggrieved and representative(s) in<br/>an effort to resolve the matter and shall render a written decision to the aggrieved<br/>and representative within ten (10) days after the Level I meeting.

Within ten (10) days after receipt of a copy of the grievance and the<br/>Principal’s proposed resolution, the exclusive representative shall transmit to the<br/>Principal its written response.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Such response shall indicate agreement or disagreement with the Principal’s<br/>proposed resolution. Supporting written rationale shall accompany a position of<br/>disagreement. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the exclusive representative’s<br/>response to the grievance, the Principal shall render a written decision to the<br/>aggrieved and send a copy to the exclusive representative.</p>
<p>7.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II - Superintendent or His Designee</p>
<p>7.3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level I, or</p>
<p>if no decision has been rendered within ten (10) days after presentation of the grievance in<br/>writing, the aggrieved or his representative may forward the written grievance to the<br/>Superintendent within five (5) days after the decision at Level I, or fifteen (15) days after<br/>the grievance was presented, whichever is later.</p>

Within ten (10)<br/>days after meeting with the aggrieved and his authorized representative, if the aggrieved is<br/>not represented by the exclusive representative, the Superintendent shall transmit a copy of<br/>the grievance and his proposed resolution of it to the exclusive representative. Within ten<br/>(10) days after receipt of a copy of the grievance and the Superintendent’s proposed<br/>resolution, the exclusive representative shall transmit to the Superintendent its written<br/>response. Such response shall indicate agreement or disagreement with the<br/>Superintendent’s proposed resolution. Supporting written rationale shall accompany a<br/>position of disagreement. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the exclusive<br/>representative’s response to the grievance, the Superintendent shall render a written<br/>decision to the aggrieved and send a copy to the exclusive representative.</p>
<p>7.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III - Arbitration</p>
<p>7.3.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level II, or</p>
<p>if the time limits expire without issuance of the Superintendent’s written reply, the<br/>aggrieved may request the Association to submit the grievance to Arbitration. In such<br/>cases, the parties shall attempt to mutually agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) days<br/>receipt by the District of the Association’s request for Arbitration. In the absence of such<br/>agreement, the parties shall request a list of arbitrators from the California State Mediation<br/>and Conciliation Service (CSMCS). /Modified2013/</p>
<p>7.3.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No party in interest shall be permitted to assert any grounds or evidence before the<br/>arbitrator which was not previously disclosed to the other party. The arbitrator shall<br/>consider only those issues which have been carried through prior steps as required by the<br/>provisions of this procedure.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>7.3.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not render any award which conflicts with or alters this<br/>Agreement. It is understood, however, that the arbitrator shall interpret the<br/>Agreement in accordance with the accepted rules of contract construction.</p>
<p>7.3.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party shall bear the full cost for its representation in the arbitration. The cost<br/>of arbitration shall be divided equally between the employer and the aggrieved.</p>
<p>7.3.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any party requests a transcript of the proceedings, that party shall bear the full cost</p>
<p>for that transcript. If the parties request one (1) transcript, the total cost of the transcript shall<br/>be divided equally between the employer and the aggrieved.</p>
<p>7.3.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absent mutual agreement (See Section 7.3.3.1) an arbitrator shall be selected by the<br/>following procedures:</p>
<p>7.3.3.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A representative of the Association or the aggrieved, if not<br/>represented by the Association, and the employer’s representative</p>
<p>shall select the arbitrator from the CSMCS list by eliminating names until<br/>one name remains. The first option of elimination shall alternate. The one<br/>remaining name shall be the arbitrator. The process of striking names shall<br/>occur within ten (10) days of receipt of the list from CSMCS by both<br/>parties.</p>
<p>7.3.3.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All grievances reaching the arbitration level shall be numbered. The odd-<br/>numbered grievances will give the employer first elimination; even-<br/>numbered grievances will give the other party first elimination.</p>
<p>7.3.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the arbitrator has been selected, hearings shall commence at the convenience<br/>of the arbitrator. Hearings shall be confined to working days.</p>
<p>7.3.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses will be assured that their testimony will be kept confidential unless they choose<br/>to make it public.</p>
<p>7.3.3.9 The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth the arbitrator’s</p>
<p>findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator<br/>will be without power or authority to make any decision which requires the<br/>commission of an act prohibited by law or which is in violation of the terms of<br/>this Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to include<br/>in any award such financial reimbursement or other remedies the arbitrator judges<br/>to be proper. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties<br/>and a copy will be submitted to the Superintendent, the aggrieved and the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>7.3.3.10 All costs for the service of the arbitrator, including but not limited to, per diem</p>
<p>expenses, the arbitrator’s travel and subsistence expenses, and the cost of any hearing<br/>room will be borne equally by the employer and the aggrieved. All other costs will be<br/>borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>7.4 General Provisions</p>
<p>7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the</p>
<p>number of days indicated at each level should be considered as a maximum and every<br/>effort should be made to expedite the process. The time specified, however, may be<br/>extended by mutual consent.</p>
<p>7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through</p>
<p>all the levels in this grievance procedure by the last working day of the school year, the<br/>time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the grievance procedure may be<br/>completed prior to the end of the school year, or as soon thereafter as it is practical.</p>
<p>7.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the unit may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure</p>
<p>up to arbitration by (1) himself, (2) legal counsel, and/or (3) a representative(s) of the<br/>Association. The member of the unit may change counsel and/or representative(s) at any<br/>level during the grievance process as long as the change is communicated in writing to the<br/>other party within a reasonable time.

<p>8.1.2.1 Staggered Program</p>
<p>8.1.2.1.1 In accordance with past practice, the District will continue to offer</p>
<p>the use of a staggered program at grades K-3 at each school site, unless the<br/>staff and principal at each school site determine this to no longer be the<br/>most appropriate form of instruction for primary students. (See Section<br/>3.21 for definition of “staggered”)</p>
<p>The provisions of Section 8.1.2.1 (and subsections) of the negotiated<br/>Agreement relating to the “staggered program” shall not apply to<br/>any grade levels participating in the State-funded Class Size</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Reduction (“CSR”) Program, as determined by the Governing<br/>Board. If the Governing Board decides to discontinue participation<br/>in the CSR Program, the provisions of Section 8.1.2.1 (and subsections)<br/>shall automatically apply to classes no longer participating in CSR.<br/>(Note: The November 21, 1997 legal opinion from the State Department<br/>of Education regarding this matter is attached to this Agreement as<br/>Appendix K.) [Negotiated!998/</p>
<p>8.1.2.2 Kindergarten Program</p>
<p>8.1.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective with the 2001-2002 school year, as space allows at<br/>individual schools, the District standard for kindergarten will be a full day<br/>(310 minutes of student contact) program as detailed below:</p>
<p>8.1.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is insufficient space at school sites for all kindergarten<br/>teachers to have full day kindergarten, decisions about kindergarten room<br/>assignments and program configuration shall be determined through<br/>consensus among the kindergarten teachers and the site administration. In<br/>the event consensus is not reached, the site administrator will make the<br/>decision.</p>
<p>8.1.2.2.2 There will be a student assessment period of five (5) weeks</p>
<p>at the beginning of each school year. The schedule of this assessment period<br/>will be determined through consensus among the kindergarten teachers and<br/>site administration. The student contact during this assessment period would<br/>be no less than 200 minutes.</p>
<p>8.1.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual children may be exempted from the requirement of full<br/>day kindergarten if requested by the parent or recommended by the<br/>classroom teacher and approved by the site administrator.</p>
<p>The District recognizes that it is within the scope of the teacher’s<br/>professional responsibility to make recommendations to parents<br/>regarding the length of the kindergarten day as it relates to the needs<br/>of their child. [Modified 2003/</p>
<p>8.1.2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that teachers have professional discretion</p>
<p>to determine the daily schedule, within the requirements of the District<br/>adopted curriculum and standards.</p>
<p>8.1.2.3 Teacher Learning Days</p>
<p>8.1.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree that there is a need for<br/>ongoing, in depth site-based teacher collaboration time.</p>
<p>Therefore, we agree to implement Teacher Learning Days at<br/>the Elementary Level.</p>
<p>8.1.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Teacher Learning Days” (Section 3.24) are defined as days</p>
<p>when students are dismissed early for the purpose of providing time for<br/>teacher collaboration. It is the intent of both parties that during this time<br/>teachers engage in collaborative school, grade or department level teams<br/>that focus on implementing each site school plan. This time is not meant<br/>to be used as individual teacher planning time or staff meeting time.</p>
<p>8.1.2.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of each Teacher Learning Day shall be determined<br/>through collaboration between the site administrator and the teachers at<br/>that site. Collaboration means that the administrator and teachers at the<br/>site will meet together to come to a mutually agreed upon decision. The<br/>expectation is that all teachers will have a voice.</p>
<p>8.1.2.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 1-3 will add 5 minutes to each “standard day” (for a total</p>
<p>of 315 instructional minutes) with the exception of their weekly prep time<br/>early release day. Grades 4-5 will add 5 minutes to each “standard day”<br/>(for a total of 315 instructional minutes), Monday through Friday. The<br/>Kindergarten instructional day will not change. On the second Tuesday of<br/>each month (except November and June) all K-5 students will be<br/>dismissed at 12:30 or 12:45, dependent on site bell schedule. The<br/>afternoon of these days will be used for site-based teacher learning time.</p>
<p>8.1.2.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time spent in teacher collaboration on Teacher Learning<br/>Days shall be 90 minutes.</p>
<p>8.1.2.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that all teachers will attend the trainings or<br/>meetings specific to their level. In collaboration with the site<br/>administrator, sub-groups of teachers, for example, Speech and Language<br/>Specialists, Resource Teachers and Special Day Class Teachers, may<br/>agree to meet in District wide grade level teams.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>8.1.2.3.7 Each site will determine, through collaboration between the</p>
<p>teachers and site administrator, a method for maintaining records of the<br/>grade, school or department level meetings held on Teacher Learning<br/>Days. This should include, but not necessarily be limited to, a statement of<br/>purpose, meeting norms, a brief summary of discussion or actions and<br/>next steps. A copy of this record will be shared with the site<br/>administrator following each Teacher Learning Day.</p>
<p>8.1.3 Preparation Time and Instructional Support</p>
<p>8.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All before and after school time shall be set aside for school-wide and<br/>individual preparation and planning, except that the employer shall require<br/>the building-based certificated employee(s) to attend regularly scheduled</p>
<p>faculty meetings. Teachers may use after school time for District-approved in-<br/>service training, fModified 2003/</p>
<p>8.1.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the before and after school time established for planning and<br/>preparation, full-time certificated employee(s) shall have preparation time. This<br/>time shall be set aside for school based and/or grade level planning. The<br/>preparation time shall be as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades K-3 self-contained and subject area specialists, 1 !4 hours per<br/>week. K-l combination classes, for purposes of this Article, are<br/>first grade classes;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For kindergarten teachers, who are not in a full day program, such<br/>preparation time shall be conducted apart from the student contact<br/>day, in accordance with past practice;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 4-5: 2 hours per week; /New 20011</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6-7-8 on the average of one period a day;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any week which has fewer than five (5) working days, if a teacher’s<br/>regular preparation period is scheduled to occur on a non-working day, such<br/>preparation period shall not be rescheduled;</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District returns to a K-6 elementary school configuration, the<br/>preparation time for 6th grade teachers shall be the same as 4-5 teachers;<br/>/Negotiated 1997]</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>g. The parties agree that there may be situations in which middle school</p>
<p>teachers voluntarily forego their preparation period to teach an additional<br/>class in lieu of hiring additional staff. The parties also agree that this is not<br/>precedent setting and is a disfavored method of staffing that the District will<br/>make every reasonable effort to avoid. In any event, a teacher who<br/>voluntarily foregoes his/her preparation period in these circumstances shall<br/>receive per diem/hourly pay or the contractual hourly rate, whichever is<br/>higher. /New 2007/</p>
<p>8.1.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All regular education 4/5<sup>th</sup> grade teachers will be provided a minimum of<br/>ninety (90)minutes per week of instructional aide time. The responsibilities<br/>of the aide will be decided by the individual teacher and may include such<br/>things as instructional support, clerical support, helping with paperwork,<br/>working with individual or small groups of students. /New 20011</p>
<p>8.1.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All preparation time shall be conducted at the school unless otherwise<br/>approved by the principal.</p>
<p>8.1.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make every effort to contain the number of individual<br/>teacher preparations at the middle schools consistent with economic<br/>and staffing necessities. /New 2003/</p>
<p>8.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch Period</p>
<p>8.1.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated employee(s) shall be entitled to a duty-free daily lunch period of not<br/>less than thirty (30) minutes. /Modified 2003/</p>
<p>8.1.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any certificated employee(s) who travels from one school to another shall<br/>be allowed a full lunch period of at least thirty (30) minutes plus travel time.</p>
<p>8.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent Conferencing</p>
<p>Parent/teacher conferencing, at the K-5 level, shall take place in a five (5) day</p>
<p>conference week during November. Conferencing days are 180 minutes</p>
<p>of instruction each. Any variance from this schedule (e.g., to provide</p>
<p>for a spring conference period) is subject to Appendix I “Contract Waiver for</p>
<p>Restructuring.”</p>
<p>8.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Minimum Days</p>
<p>Other minimum days may be established by the District Superintendent.</p>
<p>8.2 Job Sharing [Revised 2011/</p>
<p>8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees, at their own option, may apply to participate in job</p>
<p>sharing. Job sharing assignments shall be filled only by certificated employees who have<br/>jointly requested to work together.</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants must submit a written proposal for job sharing to the Human Resources<br/>Administrator. The proposed work schedule must include: assignment, duties, and the<br/>advantages to the instructional program.</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptance of employees into the job sharing program shall be at the discretion of<br/>the Board of Education.</p>
<p>8.2.3.1 Commencing with the 2007-2008 school year, in order to be eligible to</p>
<p>apply for an initial job share, employees must be permanent employees or if<br/>returning from leave, have previously established permanent status in the Sunnyvale<br/>School District and whose most recent evaluation contains “proficient” or<br/>“distinguished” ratings in all six (6) standards of the Formal Evaluation. If<br/>employee was on Alternative previous evaluation must be satisfactory or exemplary.</p>
<p>8.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the District approves of the job sharing plan and enters into a written job<br/>sharing plan with the participants, participants in the job sharing plan will be placed<br/>appropriately on the Teachers’ Salary Schedule and will receive a pro-rated salary based on<br/>the portion of the teaching assignment they fulfill.</p>
<p>8.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants in the job sharing plan will receive a pro-rated amount of the<br/>District-paid fringe benefits provided full-time teachers and a pro-rated number of sick<br/>leave days based on the percentage of the full-time regular teaching</p>
<p>assignment they fulfill. Participants in the job sharing plan who contract to work for at<br/>least fifty percent (50%) of a full year’s assignment in one school year will receive one (1)<br/>full year’s step advancement on the salary schedule provided that the requirements of<br/>Section 8.2.8 below are met. Participants in the job sharing plan who are employed for less<br/>than fifty percent (50%) of a full year’s assignment will receive one (1) year’s advancement<br/>on the salary schedule, at the end of that school year during which their accumulated<br/>service over the preceding three (3) school years has reached fifty percent (50%) or more of<br/>a full year’s assignment.</p>
<p>8.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants shall be placed appropriately on the teachers’ salary schedule, receive</p>
<p>one step increment on that schedule as provided in Section 8.2.5 and 8.2.8, and be given<br/>appropriate added increments for advance degrees, tenure, or longevity.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>8.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing participants will contribute to the State Teachers’ Retirement System<br/>and will receive appropriate credit for service toward retirement.</p>
<p>8.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A participating teacher who contracts for at least fifty percent (50%) of a full year’s service<br/>will receive credit each year for one full year’s advancement on the salary schedule when<br/>on duty for seventy-five percent (75%) of the total working days required by the terms of<br/>his annual job sharing contract of employment.</p>
<p>8.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities of an assignment may be divided and/or allocated according to a</p>
<p>plan designed by the job sharers, with the concurrence of the Human Resources<br/>Administrator. One of the participants shall be present at all faculty meetings and required<br/>staff development activities (subject to section 8.2.10 below) and shall assume<br/>responsibility for sharing pertinent information with the non-attending participant, who in<br/>turn shall assume responsibility for implementing or applying the outcomes of the staff<br/>development to the same degree expected of all teachers.</p>
<p>8.2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise directed by the immediate supervisor, participants will attend all<br/>regular parent conferences pertaining to a particular student, if both participants have had<br/>instructional contact with that student during the grading period in question.</p>
<p>8.2.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants will attend all staff development activities that occur</p>
<p>during the portion of any day on which they render service according to the<br/>approved job sharing plan.</p>
<p>8.2.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All participants will attend Back-to School Night.</p>
<p>8.2.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants will attend Open House activities that occur during the portion of any<br/>day on which they render service according to the approved job sharing plan.</p>
<p>8.2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants will be responsible for adequate planning with their partners and for<br/>short-and long-range lesson plans.</p>
<p>8.2.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a job sharer leaves for illness, etc., the remaining partner will be encouraged to</p>
<p>take over. If the partner is not able to take over, the District will attempt to substitute with<br/>personnel available within the District.</p>
<p>8.2.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants in a job sharing plan shall sign annual agreements covering the portion of the<br/>teaching assignment they elect to fulfill. Participants shall not lose the full-time tenure<br/>they have accumulated in the District.</p>
<p>8.2.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s commitment to the teacher electing to work in job sharing will be</p>
<p>for that teacher’s percent of full-time employment in the future. However, with respect to<br/>any certificated employee who has entered into a job sharing plan the following provisions<br/>shall apply:</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>If one job sharing participant, either during the term of the job sharing plan or after its<br/>termination date, dies, resigns, retires, or for any other reason permanently ceases to be a<br/>participant, the other participant shall increase his hours/days of service from part-time to<br/>full-time if the District is unable to obtain a replacement employee, satisfactory to the<br/>District, for the employee who is no longer a participant.</p>
<p>The District shall give written notice to the remaining job sharing participant of the fact<br/>that the District has not found a replacement, informing the participant that he is reassigned<br/>to full-time status. The effective date of such reassignment, if made during the teaching<br/>year, shall be twenty (20) working days following the date of such notice. If made during<br/>the summer period, the effective date of such reassignment shall be thirty (30) calendar<br/>days or twenty (20) working days following the date of such notice, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>8.2.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the job sharer wishes to increase from part-time to full-time, such increase will<br/>depend upon the staffing needs of the District and the employee’s qualifications. In the<br/>event a job sharer requests to return to a full-time teaching assignment, the District shall<br/>grant such a request before hiring personnel from outside the District to fill a position for<br/>which the job sharer is qualified and has requested. In the event that more than one job<br/>sharer requests the same position, the criteria to be followed shall be that established in the<br/>administrator initiated transfer. (See Section 11.2.2)</p>
<p>8.2.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request to return to a full-time assignment must be submitted to the Human<br/>Resources Office on or before February 1 of the school year preceding the school year in<br/>which the full-time assignment would take place.</p>
<p>8.2.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharers will be expected to be on duty full-time for three (3) of the first five (5) student<br/>instructional days in order to meet with parents and formulate their yearly instructional<br/>plan. Job sharers will also be on duty at the end of the school year on any day which they<br/>render service according to the approved job sharing plan.</p>
<p>8.2.18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For members of the bargaining unit who elect to participate as a job sharer, the</p>
<p>first year of the job sharing shall be considered a trial period, with the option of returning<br/>to full-time service guaranteed the following year. However, if a job sharer informs the<br/>District, in writing, not later than May 1 of such job sharer’s first year of job sharing that he<br/>will not have the same job sharing partner for the second year, then the first two years of<br/>job sharing shall be considered a trial period, with the option of returning to full-time<br/>service guaranteed following the second job sharing year. Those electing not to give notice<br/>would no longer have the option of returning to full-time service upon request but would<br/>be subject to the provisions of Sections 8.2.14, 8.2.15, and 8.2.16. Notice of an election by<br/>a participant not to continue with the job sharing plan beyond the trial year shall be given<br/>to the District no later than June 1.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>The District shall have the option of terminating the job sharing plan, effective at the end<br/>of the trial year. If the job sharer is denied after the trial year, within ten (10) days of the<br/>denial the principal shall give a written statement of reasons regarding why the application<br/>was not renewed. Any such denial shall be based solely on educational reasons and shall<br/>not be discriminatory, punitive, or arbitrary in nature. In the event the District does so elect<br/>to terminate the job sharing plan, the District shall have the right to reassign either or both<br/>of the job sharing participants to full-time service for the following school year, upon<br/>giving written notice to such participant(s) no later than June 1.</p>
<p>8.2.19 Renewal Procedures: The following provisions apply to participants who have not<br/>completed at least more than three (3) school years in a job share arrangement by the end of<br/>the 2006-2007 school year. If a current participant with more than three (3) school years in<br/>a job share changes job share partners for any reason, he/she will be considered to be in a<br/>new job share and therefore subject to the following provisions:</p>
<p>8.2.19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job share participants shall be required to apply for renewal every</p>
<p>three (3) years. The three (3) years shall include the one (1) year trail period set<br/>forth in section 8.2.18 above (trail year plus two years). However, if a participant<br/>changes partners after the first year, the three (3) years shall include only the second<br/>trail year pursuant to section 8.2.18 above (two trial years plus two years). The<br/>application for renewal shall be for a one or two year period. If the job share is<br/>denied, or offered for a shorter duration than requested, within ten (10) days of the<br/>denial/offer the principal shall give a written statement of reasons regarding why<br/>the application was not renewed as requested. Any denial of the request shall be<br/>based solely on educational reasons and shall not be discriminatory, punitive, or<br/>arbitrary in nature.</p>
<p>8.2.19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for renewal of job shares shall be submitted to the Human Resources<br/>Administrator no later than March 1 of the third year of the initial job share or<br/>March 1 of any subsequent year in which a renewal is being submitted. The<br/>application shall comply with the provisions of section 8.2.2 above.</p>
<p>8.2.19.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will notify applicants in writing by April 30 of the third year of the<br/>initial job share or April 30 of any subsequent year in which a renewal has been<br/>submitted as to whether the application for renewal has been accepted or denied.</p>
<p>8.2.19.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions regarding acceptance into the program, including denials or renewals,<br/>shall be subject to Article VII - Grievance Procedure, through but not beyond Level<br/>II (Superintendent/Designee). This shall not, however, preclude the Association<br/>from pursuing a grievance to arbitration based on an allegation that the District is<br/>denying all job shares as a matter of policy.</p>
<p>8.2.20 Statement of Philosophy and Implementation Efforts</p>
<p>8.2.20.1</p>
<p>8.2.20.2</p>
<p>8.2.20.3</p>
<p>The District supports options for teachers such as job sharing. The<br/>District believes that students, staff and the District may benefit from this program.<br/>Students benefit from having program options as a result of having two highly<br/>qualified teachers assigned to their classroom. Teachers benefit from having time to<br/>participate in both personal and professional activities. The District benefits by<br/>being able to retain highly qualified and competent teachers.</p>
<p>The decision to enter a job share should not be taken lightly. The coordination,<br/>collaboration and team effort require both time and energy from both partners in the<br/>job share program. Participants must ascertain that they have compatible<br/>philosophies and teaching styles to assure continuity, consistency and success for<br/>students, as well as to have a satisfying, professional experience.</p>
<p>In order to promote the success of the job share program, consistent<br/>with sections 8.2.20.1 and 8.2.20.2 above, the District and the Association agree to<br/>collaborate on activities designed to educate all parties concerned regarding the<br/>program. These activities may include, but are not limited to, such things as:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual jointly sponsored informational meetings to describe the criteria,<br/>expectations, contractual requirements, etc. of the program, as well as to<br/>describe the elements of successful partnership models.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-sponsored workshops for job share participants (focusing on teaching in<br/>job share arrangements), with stipend credit for participants and presenters.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A job faire (may be in conjunction with informational meeting) for potential<br/>job share partners to meet.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use of District email to search for potential job share partners.</p>

<p>8.3 Work Year</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year shall consist of 181 teaching days, three (3) duty days and three (3) staff<br/>development days, for a total of 187 work days for all members of the unit.</p>
<p>If the staff development days are eliminated or reduced by State action, the days shall be<br/>removed from the teachers’ duty year, and the salary schedule shall be reduced accordingly,<br/>(i.e., .5% per day) to reflect such elimination or reduction. [Negotiated 2000]</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sixth and seventh graders at the middle schools, the first instructional day shall be the<br/>day prior to the first day that K-5 and 8<sup>th</sup> grade students are scheduled to return to school.<br/>This day shall be a minimum day. The last school day for sixth and seventh graders at the<br/>middle schools shall be the day prior to the last day K-5 and 8<sup>th</sup> grade students are<br/>scheduled to be in attendance at school. The last day of school for K-5 students shall be a<br/>minimum day.</p>
<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calendar for the 2014-2015 school year is attached hereto as Appendix C.</p>
<p>8.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all work days in excess of 187, unit members shall be paid a per diem rate,<br/>using a divisor of 187.</p>
<p>8-4 Teacher-in-Charee</p>
<p>When an employee is designated a teacher-in-charge for a period of half day or more, a<br/>substitute teacher will be provided for his class. Notification shall be given to the teacher<br/>whenever possible. (See Appendix A-3 for Adjunct Duty Stipend Chart)</p>

<p>CLASS SIZE<br/>[Revised 2013J</p>
<p>9.1 Class Size Limits</p>
<p>9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student to teacher staffing ratio shall be 30:1 (K-5) except for those grade<br/>levels participating in the State-funded class size reduction program as determined<br/>by the Governing Board (see Section 8.1.2 and Appendix K). Said ratio shall not<br/>be determined by rounding to the whole number. In the event that such staffing<br/>ratio is exceeded, the District shall cause the staffing ratio to be reduced to 30:1.</p>
<p>The District shall do so within one school month after the date on which the monthly<br/>school enrollment consolidation report is posted. The ratio shall not include preparation<br/>teachers or special education teachers. This commitment shall not apply to the month of<br/>September due to the uncertainties of pupil registration during that month.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class size limits for any one class shall be set forth below. In the event a new</p>
<p>class needs to be established to meet class size requirements, it shall be established within<br/>twenty (20) working days.</p>
<p>Except as may occur pursuant to this section, commencing with the 2012-2013 school year,<br/>no K-3 class shall exceed 24 students so long as the District is participating in the state<br/>Class Size Reduction Program in any or all such grades and/or elects to maintain the class<br/>sizes set forth in this section even if the state Class Size Reduction Program no longer<br/>exists or is funded. This revision to the Agreement arises from the joint interest and<br/>purpose of mitigating if not precluding the need for laying off unit members by easing<br/>staffing restrictions in grades K-3.</p>
<p>9.1.2.1 To further meet the interest and purpose stated in section 9.1.2 above,</p>
<p>class size may rise to 25 students, subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p>a. ) All classes at the impacted grade level at the site shall already have 24 students</p>
<p>on the class roll.</p>
<p>b. ) All other options shall have been explored.</p>
<p>c. ) A teacher shall receive ten dollars ($10.00) for each day s/he has 25 students on</p>
<p>his/her class roll, provided that:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This payment shall not apply to the first twenty (20) days of student<br/>instruction at the beginning of the school year.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a 25<sup>th</sup> student is on the class roll as of the twenty-first day of student<br/>instruction, the teacher shall be entitled to this payment retroactive to the<br/>first day on which there were 25 students on the class roll.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected teachers shall receive this payment as soon as practicable but<br/>not later than the end of the month following the month in which<br/>entitlement to the payment occurred.</p>
<p>iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall meet and consult with the appropriate grade level<br/>team before deciding where to place a 25<sup>th</sup> student.</p>
<p>9.1.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding any reassignments or transfers that may occur as a result of the<br/>adjustment in class size set forth above:</p>
<p>a.) The parties affirm that current contract sections 11.3.4 and 11.4-11.4.4<br/>(Transfers), and sections 11.5-11.5.3 (Reassignments) continue to apply; and</p>
<p>b) The parties shall meet and consult regarding implementation issues that<br/>may arise in conjunction with this section.</p>
<p>9.1.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section (9.1.1 through 9.1.2.3) shall not be modified for the 2012-<br/>2013 or 2013-2014 school years except pursuant to the provisions set forth in<br/>Article XXV of this Agreement.</p>
<p>9.1.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, Fifth Grades: 32 (i.e., combination classes shall have the cap of the lower<br/>grade)</p>
<p>9.1.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth grade classes shall be staffed at 32:1 with an absolute maximum of 34. (See<br/>section 9.2.4). The 6<sup>th</sup> grade PE class size average shall not exceed the average of<br/>the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade PE classes. The average is calculated by totaling all 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th<br/></sup>grade PE students at the site and dividing that number by the total number of 7<sup>th<br/></sup>and 8<sup>th</sup> grade PE classes at the site. If at any time an individual 6<sup>th</sup> grade PE class<br/>size exceeds 38 students for a period of 30 or more school days then the parties will<br/>meet to address methods of providing additional support or reducing class size.<br/>[Negotiated 2000]</p>
<p>9.1.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, Eighth Grades: 35 - Except for Spanish, French, Chorus, P.E., Band and<br/>Orchestra, which may vary in the class size limit depending upon the course, the<br/>facilities and the plans.</p>
<p>9.1.3 Special Education</p>
<p>Resource Specialists - (as specified by California State Law)</p>
<p>Special Day Classes - (as specified by California State Law)</p>
<p>Current class size limitations for Special Education may be found in Appendix E.</p>
<p>9.2 Class Size Adjustment Procedure tGrades 4-5)</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>9.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal class size adjustments for grades 4 and 5 shall be made by the principal within<br/>twenty (20) days.</p>
<p>9.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If internal class size adjustments for grades 4 and 5 have been made by the principal and<br/>there are students to be assigned that would force the maximum class size limit to be<br/>exceeded at the applicable grade level, the following options, including but not limited to,<br/>shall be considered:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may bus the overflow pupil to another school site.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may assign a classroom aide and the aide shall remain as long as the<br/>class exceeds the class cap as outlined in section 9.1.2.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may reassign students on intra- or inter-district attendance agreements<br/>to their home school, if such an assignment would bring the affected class(es) to<br/>within the maximum class size limits and such action is deemed advisable by the<br/>principal.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination classes should be established by the principal, if this procedure will<br/>bring the affected class(es) within the maximum class size limit at the applicable<br/>grade level.</p>
<p>9.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be necessary to exceed the class limits during the school year although class limits<br/>will always be kept within the legal limitations as established by the Education Code.</p>
<p>9.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When class size maximum limits at the grades 4 and 5 level are exceeded and none of the<br/>procedures in Section 9.2.2.1 or 9.2.2.2 are acceptable, the principal shall discuss the<br/>problem with teachers of the affected classes and explore alternative approaches to resolve<br/>the problem.</p>
<p>9.3 Combination Classes /Modified2014/</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this section is to set forth the parties’ agreement to</p>
<p>provide accommodations in working conditions for those certificated employees teaching<br/>combination classes, in regular education, grades K-5 or special education, grades K-8.</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that as an accommodation, combination class teachers shall</p>
<p>be permitted four release days per year for the purpose of planning and preparation, not to be<br/>used in less than one-half day increments.</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These release days shall not accumulate from year to year. A release day must</p>
<p>be used throughout the school year. If not used, the District will pay the teacher the current<br/>substitute rate for the full day not used in that year.</p>
<p>9.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The release day will be scheduled per the regular administrative process used<br/>to schedule substitutes.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>9.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to establish a subcommittee, the purpose of which is to</p>
<p>explore and make non-cost recommendations regarding the selection of combination teachers,<br/>criteria to place students in combination classes, the implementation of curriculum, and the<br/>strategies to provide support to the combination class teachers including site duties and<br/>responsibilities such as yard duty as well as first priority for computer and library time, and<br/>other such accommodations. The subcommittee’s recommendations shall not have fiscal<br/>impact, or in any manner suggest changes that are more appropriately addressed in the<br/>negotiations forum. In addition, a site plan for addressing combo class issues will be<br/>addressed.</p>
<p>9.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subcommittee will be composed of the Assistant Superintendent of</p>
<p>Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment and the Human Resources Administrator as co-chairs,<br/>two (2) principals and four (4) teachers selected by SEA.</p>
<p>9.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subcommittee will acknowledge that past committees have examined</p>
<p>these issues and will review the past recommendations, etc., and may incorporate best practices<br/>and recommendations, if any, that were previously developed.</p>
<p>9.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra Work Agreements shall be set up for those who choose the substitute rate stipend. A<br/>School Business Agreement shall be accessed for those choosing to use the substitute. All<br/>stipend requests should be submitted prior to June 10 of each school year.</p>

<p>10.1 Illness and Extended Illness Leave</p>
<p>10.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid leaves of absence for illness or accident shall be earned by full-time employees at the<br/>rate of ten (10) days per school year for the ten-month employees and twelve (12) days per<br/>school year for twelve-month employees. Unused days of illness leave shall be<br/>accumulated without limit from year to year.</p>
<p>10.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No additional days of illness leave shall be earned as a result of special summer<br/>employment.</p>
<p>10.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all accumulated illness leave has been used, the employee shall be paid the<br/>difference between his regular salary and the salary paid to his substitute or the amount<br/>which would have been paid. During this differential pay period, the amount withheld<br/>from the employee’s salary shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of his per diem. Such<br/>period shall not exceed 100 working days beginning with the first day of absence due to<br/>illness or accident after complete use of accumulated illness leave. An employee is entitled<br/>to this leave each and every year.</p>
<p>10.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee new to the District may, upon request and verification, be credited for any<br/>unused accumulated illness leave held by him in a California school district where he was<br/>employed during the preceding school year providing such employment was for a period of<br/>one year or more.</p>
<p>10.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees absent due to illness or accident for a period of three (3) days or less<br/>may be required by the District to submit a written declaration as to the cause of the<br/>absence when there is a suspected misuse of sick leave. When the absence exceeds three<br/>(3) days, the District may require, in addition to the declaration, the employee to submit a<br/>signed statement by a physician as to the cause of the absence and the nature of the illness<br/>and the expected date of return to work. The District, at its discretion, may require an<br/>employee to submit a statement from his physician that the employee is well and able to<br/>carry on the particular duties of his assignment.</p>
<p>10.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who have exhausted all Personal Necessity Leave may use accumulated sick<br/>leave days for the purpose of caring for a seriously ill parent, child or spouse.</p>

<p>10.2 Catastrophic Sick Leave [Negotiated 2000/</p>
<p>10.2.1 Bargaining unit members may donate accrued sick leave in one-half day increments to</p>
<p>another bargaining unit member for use by that member as paid sick leave, pursuant to the<br/>requirements of this section. (See forms in Appendix J) Subject to agreement by CSEA and<br/>SCCAMP, any District employee may donate accrued sick leave to any other District<br/>employee who is eligible for Catastrophic Sick Leave. [Modified 2007/</p>
<p>Eligibility For Using Donated Time</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member must be off work full-time or part-time (not actually rendering service<br/>to the District) due to a personal serious health condition or for purposes of caring<br/>for a member of the employee’s immediate family.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member must have exhausted all accrued sick leave (under section</p><h6>10.1.1).</h6>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this section 10.2 and all subdivisions, “serious health condition” is<br/>defined as one that necessitates inpatient treatment, or at least two doctor visits (or<br/>one visit plus a continuing regimen of treatment) and incapacitates the employee for<br/>more than three consecutive days. If the employee is unable to work for more than<br/>three (3) days, he/she is considered “incapacitated.” Permanent, recurring<br/>conditions such as Epilepsy also qualify. Thus, although the definition of a “serious<br/>health condition” is much broader and more inclusive than the definition of<br/>“disability,” it does not typically extend to common ailments such as a cold or the<br/>flu. INew 2007]</p>
<p>There is no minimum or maximum number of days that must be donated, received, or used.</p>
<p>10.2.2 Procedure For Donation of Hours</p>
<p>10.2.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEA shall inform members on a case-by-case basis when the need for<br/>donated time arises.</p>
<p>10.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEA shall be responsible for collecting donated time. Members shall<br/>authorize donations in writing, signed, and dated.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>10.2.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEA shall compile the list of donated time in order of donations<br/>received and submit the list to the District along with supporting<br/>written authorizations.</p>
<p>Once the first-round list is received by the District, no more donations<br/>will be added to the list. In the event that more donations are needed,<br/>the process may be repeated.</p>
<p>10.2.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will convert the donated days to dollar amounts, based on<br/>the pay rate(s) of the donor member. Thereafter, the District will<br/>deduct sick leave from the donor, according to the list, and credit it to<br/>the member on leave, according to the pay rate of the member on<br/>leave.</p>
<p>10.2.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donor members on the list whose days were not used will have their<br/>original authorization forms returned to them as a confirmation that<br/>their donated days were not used.</p>
<p>10.3 Industrial Accident and/or Industrial Illness Leave</p>
<p>10.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accidents and industrial illnesses must be reported immediately to the<br/>employee’s supervisor. The following rules and regulations shall apply to all industrial<br/>accident and industrial illness leaves of absence.</p>
<p>10.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall be for sixty (60) days during which the schools of the District are<br/>required to be in session or when the employee would otherwise have been performing<br/>work for the District in any fiscal year for the same accident.</p>
<p>10.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>10.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>10.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person employed in a position requiring certification qualifications is absent from his<br/>duties because of an industrial accident or illness, he shall be paid such portion of the salary<br/>due him for any month in which the absence occurs as, when added to his temporary<br/>disability indemnity under Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a<br/>payment to him of not more than his full salary.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>10.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for each day of authorized<br/>absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>10.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the employee<br/>shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due him for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>10.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the employee shall be entitled to<br/>the benefits provided in the appropriate code, and for the purposes of each of these sections,<br/>his absence shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the industrial<br/>accident or illness leave, provided that, if the employee continues to receive temporary<br/>disability indemnity, he may elect to take as much of his accumulated sick leave which, when<br/>added to his temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment to him of not more than<br/>his full salary.</p>
<p>10.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the employee shall endorse to the District the temporary<br/>disability indemnity checks received on account of his industrial accident or illness. The<br/>District, in turn, shall issue the employee appropriate salary warrants for payment of the<br/>employee’s salary and shall deduct normal retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>10.3.30 Any employee receiving benefits as a result of this section shall, during periods of<br/>injury or illness, remain within the State of California unless the Governing Board<br/>authorizes travel outside the state.</p>
<p>10.4 Personal Necessity Leave (Deducted From Sick Leave!</p>
<p>10.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave shall be limited to circumstances serious in nature which the<br/>employee can not reasonably be expected to disregard.</p>

<p>10.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave may not be taken to extend vacation or holiday periods. The<br/>Human Resources Department may in its discretion grant exceptions to this rule on a case<br/>by case basis in extremely compelling circumstances. A normal two (2) day weekend does<br/>not constitute a vacation or holiday. /Modified 2011 j</p>
<p>10.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written notice of personal necessity leave shall be submitted on forms prepared by<br/>the Human Resources Department (see Appendix F). Such notice shall be filed<br/>with the employee’s principal or immediate supervisor, for forwarding to the</p>
<p>Human Resources Administrator, at least three (3) working days in advance of the effective<br/>date of the leave, or as soon in advance as possible, given the nature of the leave.</p>
<p>Requests shall be submitted as early as possible and not later than three (3)<br/>working days following the employee’s return to duty.</p>
<p>10.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District, within ten (10) days after the date on which the employee has taken<br/>personal necessity leave, may request that the employee state in writing the factual basis for<br/>such leave.</p>
<p>Within five (5) days following such request, the employee shall furnish the District with a<br/>written statement of the factual basis for such leave.</p>
<p>If the District finds that such factual basis is not true or is not a reason for personal<br/>necessity leave as defined in section 10.4.2, the employee shall not be entitled to a paid<br/>leave for the day in question. If the employee has already been paid for such day, such<br/>payment constitutes an erroneous over-payment of the employee, and the District shall be<br/>entitled to recover the over-payment by payroll deduction from the employee’s next<br/>succeeding pay warrant.</p>
<p>In case of such recovery of over-payment, the District shall restore to the employee the day<br/>of sick leave previously used.</p>

<p>10.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave shall be deducted from the employee’s accumulated</p>
<p>illness leave and limited to ten (10) days per school year. A maximum of ten (10) of these<br/>days may be used under Sections 10.4.2.1, 10.4.2.2, 10.4.2.3 or 10.4.2.4.</p>

<p>10.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial option to reduce illness leave accumulation for purposes of personal<br/>necessity leave is that of the employee, and his submittal of a personal necessity leave<br/>request shall be considered adequate evidence that reduction of illness leave is of his<br/>choice.</p>

<p>TRANSFER<br/>/Revised 2000]</p>
<p>11.1 Introduction</p>
<p>Transfer pertains to the movement of the members of the unit from one school site or facility to<br/>another school site or facility, but does not apply to a change in assignment at a particular school<br/>site or facility nor to the assignment of a member of the unit to a particular classroom, grade level,<br/>or subject area. Changes in assignment for teachers who are assigned to two or more school sites<br/>or facilities shall not be considered a transfer providing they are still performing the same duties<br/>within the position.</p>
<p>1 T2 Types of Transfers</p>
<p>The two types of transfers are: employee-initiated and administrator-initiated.</p>
<p>11-2.1 Employee-initiated transfers require that a member of the unit request, in</p>
<p>writing, to the Human Resources Administrator, a transfer from one school site or facility<br/>to another. Such a request must state the specific reasons for the request and may specify<br/>the school site or facility desired.</p>
<p>11 -2.2 Administrator-initiated transfers shall be at the discretion of the<br/>Superintendent. The Superintendent, or his designee, in a private<br/>conference, shall inform unit members who are administratively transferred<br/>of this action as early as possible. These transfers shall be in the best<br/>interests of the District’s educational program and shall not be punitive nor<br/>disciplinary in nature.</p>
<p>11.3 Procedures For Employee-Initiated Transfer</p>
<p>11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee requests for transfers shall be sent to the Human Resources Administrator<br/>with a copy to the employee’s immediate supervisor. A conference regarding the transfer<br/>shall be held at the request of the employee or the Human Resources Administrator.</p>
<p>11.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal assigned to the specified school where the vacancy exists will review all<br/>employee-initiated transfer requests. The principal will forward a list of all interviewees to<br/>the Human Resources Administrator along with a recommendation concerning the<br/>vacancy. The Human Resources Department will notify all interviewees of their status.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>11.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days, if requested, the Superintendent, or his designee, shall give the<br/>employee a written statement of reasons regarding why the employee’s request for transfer<br/>was not granted.</p>
<p>11.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a school closes, teachers at the school shall have the first opportunity to fill<br/>vacancies for which they are qualified at the school(s) where students from the closed<br/>school are transferred.</p>
<p>11.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall post in all school buildings, and the District Office shall</p>
<p>send to the Association Office, a notice of all vacancies for the ensuing school year. Such<br/>posting shall take place twice a month beginning September 1 and continuing until June 30.<br/>Thereafter, such notices shall be posted and accessed through the Human Resources link on<br/>the District website at: <a href="http://www.sesd.org">www.sesd.org</a>. If a vacancy occurs during the summer, the following<br/>methods of notification, including but not limited to, will occur:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may request a copy of open positions by supplying the Human Resources<br/>Department with a self-addressed stamped envelope with a summer address or<br/>email address.</p>

Certificated<br/>employees who are administratively transferred shall have the right to indicate<br/>preference from a list of vacancies.</p>
<p>11.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an administrative-initiated transfer results from a reduction in enrollment,<br/>service, or an increase in class size, the following criteria will be taken into<br/>consideration in determining who will be transferred:</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>The employee’s credentials, staffing needs of the school. District staffing<br/>needs, experience, desire of the teacher, seniority, and professional<br/>preparation. All other factors being equal, seniority shall govern.</p>
<p>11.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make every effort not to give an administrator-initiated transfer to an<br/>employee for a minimum of three (3) years following such a transfer. In any event, any<br/>certificated employee given an administrator-initiated transfer shall not be given another<br/>administrative-initiated transfer for a minimum of two (2) years without the consent of the<br/>employee, or unless the employee requests a transfer, or as mandated by the closure of<br/>schools, or the elimination of a position.</p>

<p>22.1 Site Based Decision Making</p>
<p>22.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association endorse the practice of Site Based Decision Making<br/>(“SBDM”), as defined in this Article, as a means for promoting collaboration and<br/>meaningful input by all interested stakeholders in decisions affecting their work<br/>environment at the school site. The parties also acknowledge and agree that under this<br/>collaborative model, the principal remains ultimately responsible and accountable for final<br/>decisions.</p>
<p>22.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of SBDM is to provide a framework for consultation between the parties. For<br/>purposes of this Article, “consultation” means participation in identifying and analyzing<br/>solutions to problems for the purpose of influencing decision-making.</p>
<p>22.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties acknowledge that different issues and/or problems will dictate the use of<br/>different levels of SBDM to be determined by the principal. These levels are:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation is for the purpose of soliciting input to influence the Principal’s<br/>ultimate decision; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation is for the purpose of soliciting input and to<br/>participate in shaping the final decision with the Principal; or</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation does not occur, in which case the Principal<br/>should communicate the decision to affected stakeholders.</p>
<p>22.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that each school site will develop and adapt its own form or system of<br/>SBDM to best meet the needs of the site, including the manner in which the parties will<br/>communicate which level of consultation applies to particular decisions (See Section<br/>22.1.3)</p>
<p>22.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall negate or modify any other provisions of this agreement that set forth<br/>a method or form of collaborative decision-making.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIII</p>
<p>RETIREMENT<br/>[Modified 2007]</p>
<p>23.1 Early Retirement</p>
<p>The following Early Retirement provisions specifically apply only to unit members whose first day<br/>of contracted paid service was prior to July 1, 2006.</p>
<p>23.1.1 Eligibility: To be eligible for Early Retirement Benefits, the employee must<br/>meet all the requirements set forth in the following sections:</p>
<p>23.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must be at least sixty (60) years old at the date of<br/>retirement.</p>
<p>23.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have served a minimum of fifteen (15) years of<br/>cumulative service in the Sunnyvale School District in a position<br/>requiring certification.</p>
<p>23.1.1.2.1 A year of service is defined as working at least seventy five</p>
<p>percent (75%) of the number of days required by the employee’s contract<br/>of employment.</p>
<p>23.1.2 Whether an eligible employee’s retirement benefits are fully or partially paid for by</p>
<p>the District will depend on the full-time or part-time service of the employee, and what<br/>level of service was performed within the three (3) years immediately prior to the date of<br/>retirement. Specifically:</p>
<p>23.1.2.1 Fully Paid Retiree Benefits: All of the following conditions must be met</p>
<p>in order for an otherwise eligible employee to receive the retiree benefits described<br/>in Section 23.1.5 below, fully paid for by the District:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have rendered at least fifteen (15) years of<br/>cumulative service as defined above.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service during all of those fifteen (15) years must have been on a full¬<br/>time basis. Full-time service is defined as the full work year as provided in<br/>Section 8.3 and for the full workday as provided in Section 8.1.1.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one (1) year of full-time service must have been within the<br/>three (3) years immediately preceding the date of retirement.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>If the employee meets conditions a) and b), but not c) above, he/she must return to<br/>and render full-time service for the year immediately preceding the date of<br/>retirement in order to receive full benefits. In this circumstance, this means that the<br/>employee would have to render more than fifteen (15) years of cumulative service<br/>in order to qualify for fully paid retiree benefits.</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed to by the parties that if the employee is on a job share<br/>contract pursuant to Section 8.2, such full-time employment shall be granted by the<br/>District if the employee notifies the District in a timely fashion. It is understood<br/>and agreed to by the parties that if the employee is in a part-time employment status<br/>which is not the result of a job share contract, the District has no obligation to<br/>increase the percentage of such employment status.</p>
<p>23.1.2.2 Partially Paid Retiree Benefits: If any of the fifteen (15) years cumulative</p>
<p>service as defined above are less than full-time as defined above, the retiree benefits<br/>provided pursuant to Section 23.1.5 below shall be paid on a percentage that is<br/>equivalent to the employee’s smallest percentage contract during the fifteen (15)<br/>year period.</p>
<p>For example, if an otherwise eligible employee worked eight (8) cumulative years<br/>of a full-time basis, and seven (7) additional cumulative<br/>years on a half-time basis, the District would pay fifty percent (50%) of the<br/>cost of the benefit provided in Section 23.1.5 below. If an otherwise eligible<br/>employee worked eight (8) cumulative years on a full-time basis, followed by four</p>
<p>(4) cumulative years a seventy-five percent (75%), followed by three (3) cumulative<br/>years at fifty percent (50%), the District would pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost<br/>of the benefits provided in Section 23.1.5 below. If the otherwise eligible employee<br/>worked fourteen (14) cumulative years on a full-time basis and an additional<br/>cumulative year at half-time, the District would pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost<br/>of the benefits provided in Section 23.1.5 below.</p>
<p>23.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties to this contract agree that the Early Retirement Scenarios A-E provided herein<br/>accurately reflect the meaning of this Section 23.1 and all subdivisions.</p>
<p>23.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide to an eligible employee, to age sixty-five (65), the benefits<br/>provided under the health and dental care programs in which the employee was enrolled in<br/>the year prior to retirement. “Programs” as used in this section refers to the type of<br/>insurance program in which the employee was enrolled, i.e. HMO or the percentage of<br/>premiums paid for by the District, since this matter is covered by Section 23.1.2.2 above.<br/>If the District changes its health or dental insurance carrier, participants in the early<br/>retirement plan will automatically be changed to the new carrier.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>23.1.5 Retiree Benefits Provided: The District will provide to an eligible employee</p>
<p>the benefits set forth in Sections 23.1 through and including 23.1.4 above provided,<br/>however, that in no case shall the District assume or pay for the full cost of retiree benefit<br/>coverage. Instead, the District shall assume and pay for the cost of retiree benefit coverage<br/>(health, dental, and vision as described in Section 23.1.4) at the same level it pays for<br/>current employee benefit coverage, effective January 1, 2004. Specifically:</p>
<p>23.1.5.1The District shall fully or partially (as set forth in 23.1.5 above) pay<br/>the cost of the retiree’s dental care program.</p>
<p>23.1.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall fully or partially (as set forth in 23.1.5 above) pay the<br/>cost of the retiree’s health (medical) care program for the employee only.</p>
<p>23.1.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall fully or partially (as set forth in 23.1.5 above) pay<br/>seventy percent (70%) of the cost of the retiree’s health (medical) care<br/>program for the employee’s dependents (i.e., one dependent or family<br/>coverage). The employee shall contribute the remaining thirty percent<br/>(30%) of the cost of dependent coverage through direct payment to the<br/>District in a manner and frequency to be determined by the District.</p>
<p>23.1.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For eligible employees who qualify for partially paid retiree benefits, the<br/>District’s 70% contribution level shall be prorated by the same percentage<br/>that is equivalent to the employee’s smallest percentage contract during<br/>the fifteen (15) year period, as set forth in Section 23.1.5.3 above. For<br/>example: For an otherwise eligible employee whose smallest percentage<br/>contract during the fifteen (15) year period was half-time (.5 FTE or 50%<br/>employee), the District would assume and pay for one-half the cost of the<br/>employee’s own health premium and one-half of the 70% contribution for<br/>dependent coverage (equal to 35% of the cost of dependent coverage).</p>
<p>The employee would contribute one-half his/her employee health<br/>premium, and the remaining 65% of the premium for dependent coverage.</p>
<p>23.2 Early Retirement [New 2006J</p>
<p>The following Early Retirement provisions, specifically apply only to unit members whose<br/>first day of contracted paid service is on or after July 2006.</p>
<p>23.2.1 Eligibility: To be eligible for Early Retirement Benefits, the employee must meet<br/>all the requirements set forth in the following sections:</p>
<p>23.2.1.1 The employee must be at least sixty (60) years old at the date<br/>of retirement.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>23.2.1.2 The employee must have served a minimum of twenty (20) years of</p>
<p>cumulative service in the Sunnyvale School District in a position requiring<br/>certification.</p>
<p>23.2.1.2.1 A year of service is defined as working at least seventy five</p>
<p>percent (75%) of the number of days required by the employee's<br/>contract of employment.</p>
<p>23.2.2 Whether an eligible employee's retirement benefits are fully or partially paid for by<br/>the District will depend on the full-time or part-time service of the employee, and<br/>what level of service was performed within the three (3) years immediately prior to<br/>the date of retirement. Specifically:</p>
<p>23.2.2.1 Fully Paid Retiree Benefits: All of the following conditions must be met in<br/>order for an otherwise eligible employee to receive the retiree benefits<br/>described in Section 23.1.5 above, paid for by the District:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have rendered at least twenty (20) years of<br/>cumulative service as defined above.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service during all of those twenty (20) years must have been on a full¬<br/>time basis. Full-time service is defined as the full work year as provided<br/>in Section 8.3 and for the full workday as provided in Section 8.1.1.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one (1) year of full-time service must have been within the three</p>
<p>(3) years immediately preceding the date of retirement.</p>
<p>If the employee meets conditions a) and b), but not c) above, he must return<br/>to and render full-time service for the year immediately preceding the date<br/>of retirement in order to receive full benefits. In this circumstance, this<br/>means that the employee would have to render more than twenty (20) years<br/>of cumulative service in order to qualify for fully paid retiree benefits.</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed to by the parties that if the employee is on a job<br/>share contract pursuant to Section 8.2, such full-time employment shall be<br/>granted by the District if the employee notifies the District in a timely<br/>fashion. It is understood and agreed to by the parties that if the employee is<br/>in a part-time employment status which is not the result of a job share<br/>contract, the District has no obligation to increase the percentage of such<br/>employment status.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>23.2.2.2 Partially Paid Retiree Benefits: If any of the twenty (20) years of</p>
<p>cumulative service as defined above are less than full-time as defined<br/>above, the retiree benefits provided pursuant to Section 23.1.5 above shall<br/>be paid on a percentage that is equivalent to the employee's smallest<br/>percentage contract during the twenty (20) year period.</p>
<p>For example, if an otherwise eligible employee worked seventeen (17)<br/>cumulative years of a full-time basis, and three (3) additional cumulative<br/>years on a half-time basis, the District would pay fifty percent (50%) of<br/>the cost of the benefit provided in Section 23.2.5 below. If an otherwise<br/>eligible employee worked nine (9) cumulative years on a full-time basis,<br/>followed by seven (7) cumulative years at seventy-five percent (75%),<br/>followed by four (4) cumulative years at fifty percent (50%), the District<br/>would pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the benefits provided in<br/>Section 23.1.5 above. If the otherwise eligible employee worked nineteen<br/>(19) cumulative years on a full-time basis and an additional cumulative<br/>year at half-time, the District would pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost of<br/>the benefits provided in Section 23.2.5 below.</p>
<p>23.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties to this contract agree that the Early Retirement Scenarios F-J provided<br/>herein accurately reflect the meaning of this Section 23.2 and all subdivisions.</p>
<p>23.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide to an eligible employee, to age sixty-five (65), the benefits<br/>provided under the health and dental care programs in which the employee was<br/>enrolled in the year prior to retirement. &quot;Programs&quot; as used in this section refers to<br/>the type of insurance program in which the employee was enrolled, i.e. HMO or the<br/>percentage of premiums paid for by the District, since this matter is covered by<br/>Section 23.2.2.2 above. If the District changes its health or dental insurance carrier,<br/>participants in the early retirement plan will automatically be changed to the new<br/>carrier.</p>
<p>23.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiree Benefits Provided: The District shall fully or partially (as set forth in 23.2.2<br/>above) provide to an eligible employee 100% of premiums for employee only, up to<br/>a maximum annual contribution of $10,000 for all benefits (medical, dental, and<br/>vision).</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>23.3</p>
<p>23.4</p>
<p>23.5</p>
<p>23.6</p>
<p>The District and the Association are authorized to negotiate changes, including increases, in<br/>the amount of employee contributions for retiree benefits. Such changes may be<br/>prospective and/or retroactive (i.e. applicable to employees who have already retired),<br/>according to the negotiated agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>Applications for participation in these early retirement programs must be made through the<br/>Human Resources Office ninety (90) calendar days prior to the effective date of retirement.</p>
<p>Retirees Maintenance of Fringe Benefits</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIV</p>
<p>DISCIPLINE<br/>(New Article, January 2009/</p>
<p>24.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just Cause/Due Process</p>
<p>24.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may discipline a unit member only for just cause. Discipline shall<br/>conform to the principles and procedures of progressive discipline.</p>
<p>24.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article is intended, for the purpose of suspension, to replace the provisions of<br/>Education Code Section 44944, but shall not apply to suspensions pursuant to<br/>Education Code Sections 44939, 44940 or 44942. Discipline under this Article<br/>shall not include dismissal or suspensions for more than fifteen (15) working days.</p>
<p>24.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive Discipline</p>
<p>The principles and procedures of progressive discipline will be applied except<br/>where the serious nature of the offense requires bypassing progressive steps.</p>
<p>Whether the serious nature of the offense required bypassing progressive<br/>discipline steps may be submitted to the grievance procedure under Article VII as<br/>described herein. If the recommended disciplinary action is suspension, then<br/>section 24.3.5 shall apply (appeal directly to arbitration). Progressive Discipline<br/>steps will include the following:</p>
<p>24.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal Warning: This is a conversation between the administrator and unit<br/>member separate from ongoing work place dialogue, where the nature of the<br/>conversation would be understood by a reasonable person to be a warning to the<br/>unit member. The administrator may, but is not required to, inform the unit<br/>member prior to or during this conversation that a verbal warning is being given.</p>
<p>24.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Warning</p>
<p>24.2.2.1 The administrator shall deliver the written warning personally to<br/>the unit member. The unit member will sign the written warning<br/>to acknowledge receipt; however this shall not constitute any<br/>admission of or agreement to the matters set forth in the written<br/>warning. The unit member shall be afforded the opportunity to<br/>review and discuss the written warning with the issuing administrator<br/>at the time of delivery or with seven (7) workdays thereafter.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the administrator shall decide with five (5) workdays,</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>Whether to finalize the written warning and whether to copy of the<br/>finalized document will be placed in the unit member’s school file.<br/>This decision shall be communicated to the unit member within the<br/>same five workday time frame. The unit member may file a written<br/>rebuttal for attachment to the finalized written warning within ten (10)<br/>workdays of receipt of the finalized written warning or the conference<br/>with the administrator, whichever is later.</p>
<p>24.2.2.2 If it has been decided that the written warning will be finalized, and<br/>the verbal warning step has been bypassed, a unit member may<br/>request a conference with the Human Resources Administrator’s<br/>decision unless the timeline is unable to be met by the Human<br/>Resources Administrator. The Human Resources Administrator’s<br/>decision regarding deposition of the written warning shall be made<br/>within five (5) days of the conference and shall be final.</p>
<p>24.2.3 Written Reprimand</p>
<p>24.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator shall deliver the written reprimand personally to the<br/>unit member. The unit member will sign the written reprimand to<br/>acknowledge receipt; however, this shall not constitute any admission<br/>of or agreement to the matters set forth in the written reprimand. The<br/>unit member shall be afforded the opportunity to review and discuss<br/>the written reprimand with the issuing administrator at the time of<br/>delivery or within seven (7) workdays thereafter. Thereafter, the<br/>administrator shall decide within five (5) workdays whether to<br/>finalize the written reprimand. A copy of the finalized document<br/>shall be placed in the unit member’s personnel file (subject to section<br/>24.2.3.2). This decision shall be communicated to the unit member<br/>within the same five (5) workday time frame. The unit member may<br/>file a written rebuttal for attachment to the finalized written reprimand<br/>if done within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the finalized written<br/>reprimand or the conference with the administrator, whichever is<br/>later. This timeline shall be extended to be ten (10) workdays after the<br/>Human Resources Administrator’s decision if section 24.2.3.2 is<br/>revoked.</p>
<p>24.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it has been decided that the written reprimand will be issued, a unit<br/>member may request a conference with the Human Resources<br/>Administrator. This conference shall take place within seven (7)<br/>workdays of the issuing administrator’s decision, unless the timeline<br/>is unable to be met by the Human Resources Administrator. The</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Human Resources Administrator’s decision regarding disposition of<br/>the written reprimand shall be made with five (5) days of the conference<br/>and shall be final, unless 1) the written reprimand was the first<br/>disciplinary step and 2) the unit member chooses to challenge the<br/>bypassing of the progressive disciplines steps as specified above.

<p>EDUCATION CODE SECTION 48910</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may suspend any pupil from class, for any of the acts enumerated in Section 48900, for the<br/>day of the suspension and the day following. The teacher shall immediately report the suspension to the<br/>principal of the school and send the pupil to the principal or the designee of the principal for appropriate<br/>action. If that action requires the continued presence of the pupil at the school site, the pupil shall be under<br/>appropriate supervision, as defined in policies and related regulations adopted by the governing board of<br/>the school district. As soon as possible, the teacher shall ask the parent or guardian of the pupil to attend a<br/>parent-teacher conference regarding the suspension. If practicable, a school counselor or a school<br/>psychologist may attend the conference. A school administrator shall attend the conference if the teacher<br/>or the parent or guardian so requests.

<p>CONTRACT WAIVER FOR RESTRUCTURING</p>
<p>APPENDIX 1(a)</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>This Agreement is designed to encourage initiative and innovation at the work site through restructuring.<br/>It is recognized that proposals for restructuring may contain provisions, which conflict with the Collective<br/>Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The following process is intended to provide the necessary flexibility for<br/>restructuring and at the same time protect the CBA.</p>
<p>Submission Process:</p>
<p>Since contract violations may not be apparent, originators are strongly advised to submit any restructuring<br/>proposal for review by the Sunnyvale School District and the Sunnyvale Education Association. In the<br/>event a conflict is identified, a waiver of the applicable section(s) of the CBA is required. Any<br/>restructuring proposal/project which violates the CBA may be grieved for failure to submit a waiver<br/>application.</p>
<p>Including the following information in the proposal will assist in reviewing the proposal for contract<br/>violations and the need for a waiver:</p>
<p>Purpose and description of the restructuring project.</p>
<p>Specific site and/or department(s).</p>
<p>Site support and the method used to demonstrate site support. Either the District or SEA may<br/>require additional evidence of site support.</p>
<p>Possible options for showing evidence of site support:</p>
<p>A petition of commitment signed by_percent of affected staff and_of all</p>
<p>staff. (Percent should demonstrate credible support.)</p>
<p>Secret ballot of affected staff and/or all staff which ensures anonymity.</p>
<p>Statements of support.</p>
<p>Report of minority opinion.</p>
<p>Other.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>APPENDIX 1(b)</p>
<p>Specific timelines for:</p>
<p>Project implementation.</p>
<p>Projection completion.</p>
<p>Evaluation process.</p>
<p>CB A language to be waived, if known.</p>
<p>District/SEA Approval Process</p>
<p>Within fifteen (15) duty days of submission of the proposal to SEA and the District for review, the<br/>originators will be notified of the status of their proposal.</p>
<p>In the event that the District and/or SEA identifies the need for a waiver, the two parties will meet to<br/>address differences, if any, and to possibly develop waiver language specific to the proposal. Either the<br/>District or SEA may request additional information about the proposal.</p>
<p>It is the goal to complete this process within forty-five (45) duty days of submission or as soon thereafter<br/>as practicable.</p>
<p>The District and SEA shall give written notice to the originators of a restructuring proposal and the site<br/>principal regarding whether a waiver has been approved.</p>
<p>Renewal</p>
<p>A waiver for a restructuring proposal may be renewed for an additional period of time by submitting a<br/>petition by the date established in the original waiver.</p>
<p>A petition for renewal must include:</p>
<p>Rationale for continuance of the project.</p>
<p>Specific site and/or department(s).</p>
<p>Results of the project evaluation process.</p>
<p>Site support and method used to demonstrate site support. Either the District or SEA may<br/>require additional evidence of site support.</p>
<p>Possible options for showing evidence of site support:</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>APPENDIX 1(c)</p>
<p>A petition of commitment signed by_percent of affected staff and_of all staff.</p>
<p>(Percent should demonstrate credible support.)</p>
<p>Secret ballot of affected staff and/or all staff which ensures anonymity.</p>
<p>Statements of support.</p>
<p>Report of minority opinion.</p>
<p>Other.</p>
<p>Specific timelines for:</p>
<p>Project continuance.</p>
<p>Project completion.</p>
<p>Evaluation process for the project during the extension of the waiver.</p>
<p>CBA language to be waived, if known.</p>
<p>Waiver Termination or Modification</p>
<p>Waiver termination or modification occurs upon any of the following events:</p>
<p>By the terms of the waiver itself.</p>
<p>By any predetermined event or condition to terminate the waiver as set forth in the<br/>restructuring proposal or by mutual agreement of SEA and the District.</p>
<p>By mutual determination of the SEA and District upon consideration of a petition by the<br/>originators of the proposal and/or any affected member to request a modification or<br/>discontinuance of the waiver. The petition shall include rationale and evidence of support.</p>
<p>Grievabilitv</p>
<p>The following shall be grievable under the Collective Bargaining Agreement:</p>
<p>The waiver application process.</p>
<p>A misapplication of waiver provisions of specific CBA language is grievable.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>APPENDIX 1(d)</p>
<p>The failure of SEA or the District to identify a restructuring proposal as requiring a waiver shall not<br/>preclude the filing of a grievance for an alleged violation of the contract.</p>
<p>Implementation of the restructuring project terms and conditions not within the scope of the contract and<br/>which did not require CBA language to be waived shall not be grievable.</p>
<p>Impact on Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>
<p>It is understood that approved waivers are not precedent setting nor do they establish a status quo. The<br/>waiver is applicable only to the specific site for which the waiver is granted and only for the specified<br/>time, thereby preserving the language for all other sites. Upon expiration of the waiver, the CBA<br/>language which was waived once again applies to that site and/or department.</p>
<p>Review</p>
<p>The parties shall review the waiver process annually between March 1 and April 1 by considering whether<br/>the waiver process as implemented has satisfactorily met the interests of both parties. If either or both<br/>parties believe the process should be modified, the parties will attempt to mutually agree to an amended<br/>process. No new waivers shall be granted after April 1 unless and until such time as the parties mutually<br/>agree to the amended process.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregory DanniS</p>
<p>Breen, O'Donnell, Miller, Brown Sc Dannie<br/>71 Stevenson Street - 19th Floor<br/>Sen FrandUco, California 94105</p>
<p>He: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Opting&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Out&quot; of Education Code Section 46205;</p>
<p>Your file 8125.2.202</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Dannis:</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>■t</p>
<p>You wrote to our office aome time ago with a perplexing question about<br/>opting in and out of the early-late program aa described in Education Code<br/>section 46205, and satisfaction of the longer day /year requirements. After<br/>considerable discussion with staff here in the Department of Education, and<br/>taking into consideration my conversation* with Seth Neulight of your office,<br/>I believe we have reduced this issue to an answer which ! can provide fairly<br/>simply.</p>
<p>Section 46265 provides in part that</p>
<p>“(a) JQns fractional time for school district* conducting eariy-late<br/>instructional program* in kindergarten and gndae 1 to f inclusive, shall be<br/>computed by adoferw Che total amount of instructional time provided fat each<br/>portion of the eariyHtrte instructional program* to Ihs amount of instructional<br/>time offered when all pupils in the dam are scheduled to attend.</p>
<p>(b) This section shall be applicable only if the earfylste instructional<br/>program waa in operation during the 1985*44 fiscal year,... .*</p>
<p>Our opinion is that in order to qualify for um of the section 46205 calculation,<br/>the law requires merely that the district have had such • program In<br/>operation in 1983-84. There is also an exception under which the State<br/>Superintendent may approve the use of that section. The exception la<br/>irrelevant in the instant case because the district you describe already qualifies<br/>under ihs primary requirement — operation during the 1983-84 fiscal year.</p>
<p>The law does not require continuous participation In “eariy-lata* as a<br/>condition for using that program structure to meet the longer day/year<br/>Instructional minutes requirements. Hence, a district using early-late to</p>
<p>APPENDIX K(b)</p>

<p>jjtlify a portion of the annual initrurfonil rvinviu n^uuwwftt could &quot;opt<br/>out&quot; of eajly*late, and satisfy the instructions! time requirement with ft<br/>different program schedule, but still be eligible to &quot;opt back in&quot; to the early<sup>-<br/></sup>late program structure et • later time.</p>
<p>We believe it is understood, however, that, whatever class schedule is used,<br/>the annual minutes of instruction cannot fall below 36,000 for kindergarten<br/>and 50,400 for grade* 1 - 3, or the total minutes of instruction for those grades<br/>during the 2962-63 base year - whichever is greater. Failure to meet those<br/>instructional time atandarda results in serious fiscal penalties.</p>
<p>I have enclosed the page* from the class size reduction question and answer<br/>document which addreci the longer day/year issue in general, in case they are<br/>of intereat to you.</p>
<p>I hope this analysii will be of assistance in resolving your question. I<br/>apologize deeply for the length of time it ha# taien for thlsresponse. If you<br/>have additional queationa, I can be reached directly at (916) 657-9454.</p>
