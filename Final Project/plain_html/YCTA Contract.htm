<p>4.1.1 The below listed procedures will be implemented when one (1) or more of the<br/>following conditions exists which necessitates staffing reductions which have not<br/>been accomplished through resignations, retirements, administrative transfers, or<br/>other administrative actions. The District will consult with the Association when<br/>it becomes known that one of these conditions is anticipated.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-wide program changes</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School closings</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decrease in school enrollment</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will meet with affected staffs to:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explain staffing allocations, contractual provisions for<br/>assignment/transfer, and the below described procedures;</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;announce vacant positions in the school/program and staffing needs;<br/>and</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notify staff of the number of positions that will be eliminated<br/>(number of displaced positions). The total number of displaced<br/>teachers is limited to the total net number of “displaced” positions in<br/>the school or program.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association President shall receive timely notification of the<br/>time, location and date of the meeting.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, the District will review a list of all unfilled new and vacant</p>
<p>teaching positions with staff at the affected sites.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each site will be provided with a list setting forth the District-wide<br/>seniority of unit members at that site. Seniority, for purposes of this<br/>Article, shall be as defined in Article 3 - Transfers, Section 3.1.5 (this<br/>shall not include service pursuant to an emergency/provisional<br/>credential or as a substitute).

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of volunteers exceeds the number of displaced<br/>positions, and a volunteer (with the appropriate credentials,<br/>qualifications, etc.) resolves the excess, District-wide seniority will<br/>be the determinant.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are an insufficient number of volunteers to eliminate the<br/>surplus, teachers (with the appropriate credentials, qualifications,<br/>etc.) shall be displaced in reverse order of District-wide seniority.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the position selected by the volunteer to be displaced is no longer<br/>available, because it was selected by a more senior displaced teacher,<br/>the volunteer may rescind their displaced teacher status.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School program changes which result in the change of assignment for a<br/>teacher who has taught a specific content area or grade level in the same<br/>District school for twenty (20) or more consecutive years.</p>
<p>4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affected school site principal will meet with staff to explain staffing<br/>allocations/assignments, contractual provisions for assignment/<br/>reassignment/transfer, and these procedures.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will announce vacant positions in the school and notify staff of<br/>the number of individuals who may be displaced in accordance with these<br/>procedures.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are displaced will, at their request, be transferred to any<br/>currently advertised new or vacant position in the school or District at the<br/>specific grade level (and content area) from which he/she is displaced, for<br/>which he/she is qualified.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two (2) or more displaced teachers are qualified under these procedures,<br/>seniority (see Article 3 - Transfers, Section 3.1.5, Seniority) will be the<br/>determinant.</p>

<p>14.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person is absent from his/her duties because of industrial accident or<br/>illness, he/she shall be paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any month<br/>in which absence occurs, as when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity<br/>under Division 4 or Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a payment to<br/>him/her equivalent to his/her full salary.</p>
<p>14.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one (1) day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>

<p>14.8.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the unit member may endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability indemnity checks received because of his/her industrial<br/>accident or illness. Once the decision is made by the unit member, the same<br/>method will be continued while on the leave. If the method is changed, the unit<br/>member will provide sufficient lead-time for the Business Office to process the<br/>warrants. The District, in turn, shall issue the unit member appropriate salary<br/>warrants for payment of the unit member’s salary and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>

<p>14.9 Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>14.9.1 Creation</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to maintain a Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank. (Created July 1, 1993).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall accumulate from school year to<br/>school year (July 1 - June 30).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank without<br/>regard to the daily rate of pay of the Catastrophic Leave Bank participants.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by a committee<br/>comprised of three (3) members appointed by the Association and two (2)<br/>members appointed by the District.</p>
<p>14.9.2 Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members on active duty with at least one (1) year of employment<br/>with the District are eligible to contribute to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires a contribution to the Bank. Only<br/>contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank. Contributions and<br/>withdrawals shall be prorated according to the unit member’s contracted<br/>work day/year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon first<br/>becoming eligible have a waiting period of forty-five (45) duty days after<br/>joining the bank before becoming eligible to withdraw from the Bank. This<br/>forty-five (45) day period does not modify the provisions for withdrawal<br/>specified in Section 14.9.3.c.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial contribution, on the appropriate form, will be authorized by the<br/>Unit Member to initiate enrollment and continuous enrollment shall occur<br/>from year to year until canceled by the Unit Member.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation occurs automatically whenever a Unit Member fails to make a<br/>required assessment. Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to the<br/>Bank shall not be returned if the Unit Member effects cancellation.</p>
<p>YCUSD/YCTA Contract<br/>2010-2011<br/>Final 06/16/11</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be made between July 1, and October 1, of each school<br/>year. Unit members returning from extended leave which included the<br/>enrollment period and new hires will be permitted to contribute within thirty<br/>(30) calendar days of beginning work. The District shall supply enrollment<br/>forms for the Catastrophic Leave Bank to all new unit members and those<br/>unit members returning from leave.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of contribution by each participating Unit Member for each<br/>school year shall be seven(7) hours of sick leave. The Committee may<br/>decide that the annual contribution is not necessary to maintain an<br/>appropriate number of hours in the Bank as determined by the Committee.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee may require, at any time, an additional day of contribution<br/>of participants if the number of hours in the Bank falls below a level to be<br/>determined by the Committee. Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who<br/>are drawing from the Bank at the time of the assessment will not be required<br/>to contribute to remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank participant has no remaining sick leave at the time of the<br/>assessment, they need not contribute the additional hours to remain a<br/>participant in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>14.9.3 Withdrawal from the Bank</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants, whose sick leave is exhausted, may<br/>withdraw from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury. Catastrophic<br/>illness or injury shall be defined as any illness or injury that incapacitates the<br/>unit member for over ten (10) consecutive duty days. Catastrophic illness or<br/>injury shall be defined as any illness or injury that incapacitates a member of<br/>the unit member’s immediate family for over ten (10) consecutive duty days<br/>which requires the unit member to take time off to care for that family<br/>member for no more than thirty (30) duty days in a school year. If a<br/>reoccurrence or a second illness or injury incapacitates a unit member or<br/>member of the unit member’s family within twelve (12) months, it shall be<br/>deemed catastrophic after five (5) consecutive duty days.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must use all sick leave as defined in Article 14 of this Agreement<br/>available to them before they are eligible for a withdrawal from the Bank.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of the first ten (10) duty days of illness or disability must be<br/>covered by the participant’s sick leave, differential leave, or leave without<br/>pay the first time said participant qualifies for a withdrawal from the Bank.<br/>For subsequent withdrawals within twelve (12) consecutive months, the first<br/>five (5) duty days of illness must be covered by the participant’s differential<br/>leave, or leave without pay.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant is incapacitated, applications may be submitted to the<br/>Committee by the participant’s agent or member of the participant’s family.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of<br/>no more than thirty (30) duty days, with a limit of sixty (60) duty days per<br/>year.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the expiration of a Catastrophic Leave allocation period, a recipient<br/>is eligible to apply to extend the leave allocation from the Bank in thirty (30)<br/>day units with no waiting period. Any extension of leave beyond the initial<br/>thirty (30) days allowed is at the discretion of the Committee. A<br/>participant’s withdrawal may not exceed twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank will be required to submit a statement from the<br/>treating physician indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the<br/>probable length of absence from work. Members of the Committee shall<br/>keep information regarding the nature of the illness confidential.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant has drawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank days and<br/>requests an extension, the Committee may require a medical review by a<br/>physician of the Committee’s choice at the participant’s expense. Refusal to<br/>submit to the medical review will terminate the participant’s continued<br/>withdrawal from the Bank. The Committee may deny an extension of<br/>withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank based upon the medical report.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualify<br/>the participant for Worker’s Compensation benefits.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee may reasonably presume that the applicant for a draw<br/>may be eligible for a Disability Award or a Retirement under STRS or, if<br/>applicable. Social Security, the Committee may request that the draw<br/>applicant apply for disability or retirement. Failure of the draw applicant to<br/>submit a complete application, including medical information provided by<br/>the applicant’s physician, within twenty (20) calendar days will disqualify<br/>the draw applicant from further Catastrophic Leave Bank payments. Any<br/>requests for additional medical information from STRS or Social Security<br/>shall be submitted within ten (10) days or the participant’s entitlement to<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank payments will cease. If denied benefits by STRS<br/>or Social Security, the applicant must appeal or entitlement to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall cease.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a<br/>withdrawal request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide days<br/>and the District is under no obligation to pay the participant any funds</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>whatsoever. If the Committee denies a request for withdrawal (or<br/>reapplication), because of insufficient days to fund the request, they shall<br/>notify the participant, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the exhaustion of sick<br/>leave or the waiting periods provided for in Sections 14.9.2.c. and 14.9.2.d.,<br/>whichever is greater. For example, if a participant contributed when first<br/>eligible to contribute (Section 14.9.2.c) and had ten (10) days of accumulated<br/>sick leave when the illness began (Section 14.9.3.c), he/she shall begin<br/>withdrawing upon the eleventh (11th) duty day if otherwise eligible. If the<br/>participant had fifteen (15) days of sick leave at the beginning of the illness,<br/>he/she shall begin withdrawing days on the sixteenth (16th) duty day. If the<br/>participant had five (5) days of sick leave at the beginning of the illness,<br/>he/she shall begin withdrawing days on the eleventh (11th) duty day.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave shall not begin until receipt of written approval from the<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Committee is final and binding upon the participants.</p>
<p>14.9.4 Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee shall have the responsibility of<br/>maintaining the records of the Catastrophic Leave Bank, receiving<br/>withdrawal requests, verifying the validity of requests, approving or denying<br/>the requests, and communicating its decision, in writing, to the participants.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the Bank.<br/>The Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests complying with<br/>the terms of this Article. Withdrawals may not be denied on the basis of the<br/>type of illness or disability.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications shall be reviewed and decisions of the Committee reported to<br/>the applicant, in writing, within ten (10) duty days of receipt of the<br/>application.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose the<br/>nature of the illness except as is necessary to process the request for<br/>withdrawal and defend against any appeals of denials.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 1 of each school year, the District shall notify the Committee of<br/>the following:</p>
<p>(1) The total number of accumulated days in the Bank on June 30th of<br/>the previous school year.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of days contributed by unit members of the current year.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of participating unit members.</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days available in the Bank.</p>
<p>f. By the tenth (10th) day of each calendar month, the District shall notify the</p>
<p>Committee of the following:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of any additional Unit Members who have joined in<br/>accordance with Section 14.9.2 of this Article.</p>

<p>14.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher shall have the responsibility for arranging for the payback of exchange<br/>day(s) with another teacher within twelve (12) calendar months from when the<br/>initial exchange occurred.</p>
<p>14.10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall have no responsibility for any inequities that may arise between<br/>affected teachers based upon the exchange of days pursuant to this provision. The<br/>issue of any perceived inequities that may arise between teachers pursuant to<br/>Section 14.10.1, above shall not be subject to the grievance procedures.</p>

<p>At each comprehensive high school, the administration agrees to make a reasonable effort<br/>to establish a school-wide range of class sizes which provides the best learning environment<br/>possible under the conditions that exist at the time of scheduling. During the school year,<br/>class sizes may vary as students’ schedules change and new students enter. However,<br/>counselors, teachers, and the administration agree to make reasonable efforts to maintain the<br/>best feasible class sizes. A committee composed of unit members, school administrators and<br/>district administrators will meet in October and after the end of the first (1<sup>st</sup>) semester to<br/>review class sizes at each comprehensive high school and make appropriate<br/>recommendations for balancing classes to the appropriate site administration.</p>

<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared teaching requests must be approved by the school principal and submitted to the<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources no later than May 1 of the prior school term.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for shared teaching contracts shall be re-submitted and approved annually.</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared time is defined as any combination of days and/or hours, which will enhance the<br/>educational opportunities for students and accommodate unit members needs.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee requesting to enter into a shared-teaching assignment may submit the name<br/>of a teacher willing to share the assignment with him/her. However, the selections for<br/>anyone entering into this agreement will be at the discretion of the District.</p>
<p>18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health and dental benefits will be paid to the unit member working more than a fifty percent<br/>(50%) contract.</p>
<p>18.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee in a shared teaching arrangement will receive that prorated part of a salary<br/>as his/her fraction of a full working year relates to a full salary.</p>
<p>18.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s contribution to retirement and sick leave benefits for the employee would be<br/>that prorated part of those benefits as his/her workyear relates to a full working year.</p>
<p>18.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee in a shared-teaching arrangement assumes the same commitment as a full¬<br/>time teacher to the following stipulations:</p>
<p>18.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance at staff meetings.</p>

Tandem teachers or those<br/>on a part-time contract who are required to attend a full day inservice, will be<br/>compensated for the additional time spent up to a full daily rate consistent with the<br/>compensation covered by full-time staff.</p>
<p>18.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in student centered meetings (i.e., child study team, SAFE team,<br/>I.E.P.) should be coordinated between the shared-teaching partners so that relevant<br/>information is presented and received.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>18.9 Those employees on a shared-teaching agreement will be responsible for their prorated share<br/>of the hours as stipulated in this contract within Article 6 - Hours. If one of the teachers in<br/>a shared-teaching assignment needs to go on authorized leave, he/she is responsible for<br/>arranging that his/her portion of class time will be covered while on leave.</p>
<p>18.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent is that only the teacher working more than a fifty percent (50%) contract will<br/>receive the health, dental, and vision benefits even though the other teacher, may, in fact,<br/>take the class for several entire days.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 37: CALENDAR COMMITTEE</p>
<p>37.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Calendar Committee shall be established to develop a recommendation for the student<br/>attendance calendar.</p>
<p>37.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall be comprised of six (6) members appointed by the Association and six<br/>(6) members appointed by the District.

<p>37.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calendar Committee shall submit proposed calendars to the District and the YCTA<br/>bargaining team by January 1, for approval.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 38: DISTRICT AND SITE PANELS AND COMMITTEES</p>
<p>The District and YCTA agree that an understanding exists that active panels or committees (whether<br/>ad hoc or prescribed) should not take action nor make decisions that violate collective bargaining<br/>agreements or side letters of agreement.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 39: STAFF DEVELOPMENT DAYS</p>
<p>Note: The parties have jointly determined, based on State decisions regarding education<br/>funding, that there shall be no staff development days in 200912010 and 201012011. As<br/>a result, the salary schedule and work year have been adjusted as specified in Article 39<br/>(the work year for unit members decreased by two (2) workdays for staff development and<br/>the salary schedule decreased by 1.1%). The issue of staff development days will, however,<br/>continue to be a matter of annual negotiations commencing with the 201112012 year.</p>
<p>39.1 Annual Negotiations</p>
<p>39.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the desire and intent of the District and the Association that there is to be</p>
<p>a continuing staff development program in the District, the parties agree that the<br/>staff development programs will be a subject of negotiations during each school<br/>year of this Agreement.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, unless the parties agree otherwise before June 30 of each year for<br/>the coming school year, through the collective bargaining process, the<br/>program shall be effective only for the current school year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, unless the parties agree otherwise before each June 30 through<br/>the collective bargaining process, the provisions of the Side Letter<br/>implementing the program will become null and void on that June 30, and the<br/>work year length will revert to the status quo prior to the agreement on the</p>
<p>YCUSD/YCTA Contract</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>1999-2000 staff development pilot program, and the salary schedule will be<br/>adjusted to reflect the 1998-99 salary schedule plus any subsequently<br/>negotiated percentage increase(s).</p>
<p>39.1.2 Any agreement reached shall be embodied in a Side Letter which is effective only<br/>for the designated year.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 40: RIGHT TO CONSULT ON CURRICULAR ISSUES</p>
<p>40.1 Preamble</p>
<p>40.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GovernmentCode3543.2(a) states that “the exclusive representative of certificated<br/>personnel has the right to consult on the definition of educational objectives, the<br/>determination of the content of courses and curriculum and the selection of<br/>textbooks to the extent such matters are within the discretion of the public school<br/>employer under the law.”</p>
<p>40.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District respects and appreciates the advice and counsel of its teachers in<br/>preparing recommendations related to the selection of textbooks, the content of<br/>courses and curriculum, and in the definition of educational objectives.</p>
<p>40.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the consultation process in such matters, the District and YCTA agree<br/>to establish the following processes and procedures.</p>
<p>40.2 Joint Meet and Consult Committee</p>
<p>Meet and Consult is a joint YCTA and District committee, where the advice and counsel of<br/>teachers can be heard with regards to Curriculum and Instruction decisions for the District.</p>
<p>40.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific committee shall be comprised of teachers who represent certain<br/>populations of students: K-5, 6-8, and 9-12. There may be meetings of just the K-<br/>5, 6-8, or 9-12 subcommittees.</p>
<p>40.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If appropriate, larger groups may be formed, such as K-8 (by combining the K-5<br/>and 6-8 committees) or 6-12 (by combining the 6-8 and 9-12 committees). There<br/>may be times when it is appropriate for the entire committee to meet.<br/>Subcommittees shall be organized to address curriculum and instruction issues<br/>specific to different grade level groupings. The discussion in these specific groups<br/>will allow for the advice and counsel of teachers with direct experience at the<br/>impacted grade levels and will allow more sites to actively participate in the<br/>consultation dialog.</p>

<p>TEACHER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>Appendix A</p>
<p>I. Instructional Guidelines</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruction is the means for implementing the curriculum and consists of teacher-<br/>student interaction leading to achievement of course/unit objectives. Instruction is<br/>the direct responsibility of the teacher.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four (4) concepts of instruction that are important to effective<br/>teaching/leaming:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diagnostic-prescriptive teaching;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher role as guide to learning, utilizing the principles of learning, rather than<br/>as a conveyor of knowledge;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting individual student needs and interests; and</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students’ attitudes toward themselves as learners.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translating these concepts into operational terms of teacher behavior, Yuba City<br/>Unified School District has defined competent instruction as follows:</p>
<p>The teacher:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is proficient in factual content included in unit/course/subject area;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directs instruction to accomplishment of objectives stated in District Course of<br/>Study (as completed);</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepares current lesson plans which include objectives, activities, resources,<br/>and has them available;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can state objectives for a specific lesson in progress and their relation to the<br/>course of study and District goals;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has evidence of how well students can perform objectives before instruction<br/>begins (diagnosis) and is able to formulate and to teach to an instructional<br/>objective based on data obtained from the diagnosis (prescription);</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encourages active involvement of students;</p>
<p>YCUSD/YCTA Contract<br/>2010-2011<br/>Final 06/16/11</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses a variety of activities and materials by which students obtain information<br/>leading to development of objectives;</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provides a variety of activities by which students share knowledge with<br/>classmates and reinforce their own learnings;</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insures that prerequisite learnings are effected prior to more difficult or<br/>complex learnings;</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provides opportunities for students to draw generalizations from facts and to<br/>state them accurately, to distinguish cause and effect relationships, to create,<br/>and to make decisions;</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develops an atmosphere that encourages students’ learning by:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treating all students in a positive manner;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interest/enthusiasm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit/course study;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helping students develop a positive self-image by:</p>
<p>i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;striving for success in every student,</p>
<p>ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emphasizing what students have learned rather than what they<br/>have not learned;</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uses a variety of ways to evaluate student accomplishment of stated objectives;</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provides remedial and enrichment activities as needed;</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provides evidence of students’ achievement;</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintains control in the classroom.</p>
<p>II. Instructional Support Guidelines</p>
<p>A. Direct contact in the classroom comprises the primary responsibilities of teachers.<br/>It is recognized, however, that learning is not limited to the physical limits of the<br/>classroom, and that teachers have a responsibility for mental, physical, and<br/>emotional growth of students at all times that school is in session, including<br/>extensions of the normal school day and other school activities. These teacher<br/>activities include the following:</p>
<p>YCUSD/YCTA Contract<br/>2010-2011<br/>Final 06/16/11</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>The teacher:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintains required pupil records and communicates this information to other<br/>personnel who request and demonstrate a need for said information;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supervises pupils outside the classroom during the regular working day;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conferences with other certificated staff members regarding students;</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attends District and building faculty meetings;</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advises clubs and classes and supervises athletic games and dances on a<br/>voluntary basis as set forth in Article 6.7.</p>
<p>B. It is understood that the teacher is obligated to follow the rules and regulations of the</p>
<p>District, the provisions of the Education Code, and the provisions of the contract</p>
<p>between the School District and the Yuba City Teachers Association.</p>

<p>MEDICAL, DENTAL, LIFE AND VISION BENEFITS PLANS</p>
<p>Appendix D</p>
<p>A. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of Projected Changes</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a change in insurance providers initiated by YCTA after June 30, 2006, costs<br/>associated with the change shall be paid by payroll deduction by members of the<br/>bargaining unit receiving health benefits.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount to be deducted from each affected unit member’s monthly check shall be<br/>computed by dividing the costs by the number of FTE in the bargaining unit (who are<br/>receiving health benefits at that time), divided by twelve (12). Unless another date is<br/>mutually agreed upon, the deduction shall be based upon the number of FTE in October<br/>of the year of the change. Deductions shall occur until the full cost associated with the<br/>change has been repaid by unit members.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible Unit Members</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical, dental, life and vision benefits in the amount stated above will be paid for<br/>certificated unit members on the teachers’ and psychologists’ salary schedules<br/>receiving fifty percent (50%) or more of the full-time salary for which he/she qualifies<br/>on those salary schedules as included in this Agreement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular full-time Children’s Center and Preschool teachers shall receive the medical,<br/>dental and vision benefits for those months that they are employed in the respective<br/>programs.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Establishment of Base Plan</p>
<p>Annually, the Association shall establish as its base plan for medical one of the plans</p>
<p>available through the designated insurance provider. Employees, at their sole discretion and</p>
<p>cost, shall be permitted to “buy up” in accordance with the rules of the insurance provider.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance of Dollars</p>
<p>When negotiations are in progress concerning the District’s required contribution for<br/>insurance premiums, the District shall promptly provide the Association with notice of a<br/>projected rate increase. Within ten (10) working days, the parties shall schedule a bargaining<br/>session to explore options and alternatives. To minimize the impact on unit members, if no<br/>agreement is reached, the District shall allocate a portion of the funded increase to the Base</p>
<p>YCUSD/YCTA Contract</p>
<p>2010-2011</p>
<p>Final 06/16/11</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Revenue Limit to help mitigate the rate increase for active employees (i.e. not Retirees)<br/>while negotiations are in progress.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount to be allocated shall be equal to one-half (Vi) of the funded increase to the<br/>Base Revenue Limit (expressed as a percentage) multiplied times the most current<br/>dollar cost of a one percent (1%) raise to the bargaining unit. The resulting sum will<br/>be:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first, divided by the number of FTE’s enrolled in medical, dental and vision;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second, divided by twelve (12) to arrive at the amount used to supplement the<br/>District’s CAP while negotiations are occurring.</p>
<p>This supplement is an advance for the current fiscal year only (i.e. it will not<br/>permanently increase the CAP except through negotiations).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If required, the unit member shall contribute the difference between the CAP (with the<br/>supplement being paid by the District) and the premium by payroll deduction pending<br/>the results of negotiations.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the final agreement negotiated between the parties does not allocate sufficient dollars<br/>to raise the CAP on the District’s contribution for insurance premiums, the unit<br/>member shall repay the District for dollars advanced pursuant to A.4.a. above.</p>
<p>B. REQUIRED DISTRICT CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PREMIUMS</p>
<p>Effective October 1, 2006:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAP on the District’s contribution for insurance premiums shall be Nine Hundred<br/>Eighty-Seven Dollars and Twenty-Six Cents ($987.26)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should both a husband and wife (or two recognized domestic partners) receive benefits<br/>through the Central Valley Trust (CVT), any savings from the spousal credit shall accrue to<br/>the District.</p>
