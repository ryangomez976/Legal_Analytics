<p>CONTRACT VIOLATION PROCEDURE</p>
<p>1 Definitions</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “contract violation” is a formal written claim by one or more bargaining<br/>unit member or the Association, that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of a provision of this Agreement. A unit<br/>member may file, on behalf of the Cardiff Elementary Teachers’<br/>Association, a contract violation alleging a violation of Association rights<br/>under a specific provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “grievant” is the bargaining unit member, unit members, or the<br/>Association making the claim.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is a day in which the central administration office of the District is<br/>open for business.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate supervisor” is the lowest level administrator having<br/>immediate jurisdiction over the bargaining unit member who has been<br/>designated by the District to adjust contract violations. Beginning at Step<br/>2 of the Contract Violation Procedure, a teacher or teachers filing a<br/>contract violation may choose to be represented by the Cardiff Elementary<br/>Teachers Association.</p>
<p>2. Time Limitation and Waiver</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract violation shall not be valid for consideration unless it is<br/>submitted in writing, on the prescribed form (Appendix A), to the building<br/>principal setting forth the facts and specific provisions of the Agreement<br/>allegedly violated and the particular relief sought within twenty (20) days<br/>after the teacher or teachers through the use of reasonable diligence,<br/>should have had knowledge of the occurrence that gave rise to the<br/>contract violation. Failure to file any contract violation within such period<br/>shall be deemed a waiver thereof.</p>
<p>Failure to appeal a contract violation from one step to another within the<br/>time periods hereafter provided shall constitute a waiver of the contract<br/>violation.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computation of Time: In computing any period of time prescribed or<br/>allowed by procedures herein, the time of the act, event, or default for<br/>which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.<br/>The last date of the period so computed shall be counted, unless it is a<br/>Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until<br/>the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal<br/>holiday.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>C. Filing and Postmark: The filing or service of any notice or document</p>
<p>herein shall be timely if it bears a postmark of the United States mail within<br/>the applicable time period</p>
<p>D Failure by the District or its representatives to issue a decision within the<br/>time periods provided herein shall constitute a denial of the contract<br/>violation and the teacher may appeal to the next step.</p>
<p>Procedure</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step One: Prior to filing a formal written contract violation the grievant<br/>shall first make an effort to adjust the alleged contract violation informally<br/>with his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Two: If the contract violation is not resolved through informal<br/>discussion with the immediate supervisor pursuant to Step One, the<br/>grievant shall submit the prescribed contract violation form within the<br/>twenty (20) day time limitation provided in Section 2.A. of this Article.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after receipt of the written contract violation, the<br/>immediate supervisor shall issue a decision in writing to the employee.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Three: In the event the contract violation is not resolved at Step<br/>Two, the decision rendered may be appealed to the Superintendent within<br/>ten (10) days after the decision at Step Two. The Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee shall set a time to meet regarding the contract violation<br/>within seven (7) days after receipt of the appeal. Within five (5) days after<br/>the meeting, the Superintendent or his/her designee shall issue a decision<br/>in writing to the grievant.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Four: In the event the contract violation is not resolved at Step<br/>Three, the grievant may, within ten (10) days after the decision at Step<br/>Three, submit a request in writing to the Superintendent for arbitration of<br/>the dispute.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant and the District shall attempt to agree upon an<br/>advisory arbitrator. If no agreement can be reached, they shall,<br/>within five (5) days after the request for arbitration, request the<br/>State Conciliation Service to supply a panel of five (5) names, each<br/>party shall alternately strike a name until only one (1) name<br/>remains. The remaining panel member shall be the advisory<br/>arbitrator. The order of the striking shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be<br/>borne equally by the District and the Association. However, if the<br/>Board rejects, in whole or in part, the arbitrator’s recommendation<br/>at Step Five, the District shall pay all fees and expenses of the<br/>arbitrator. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring<br/>them.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render<br/>a decision on the issue or issues submitted to him/her. If the<br/>parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the arbitrator<br/>shall determine the issues by referring to the written contract<br/>violations and the answers thereto at each step and the Agreement.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from or modify<br/>the terms of the Agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations<br/>and procedures of the District.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to<br/>make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all<br/>parties his/her findings and recommendations which shall be<br/>advisory to the parties.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Five: In the event that either party is not satisfied with the<br/>recommendation or recommendations of the arbitrator, that party may<br/>appeal the decision, in writing, within ten (10) days to the Board of<br/>Trustees.</p>
<p>1) The Board alone has the power to render a final and binding</p>
<p>determination of a contract violation. The recommendation of the<br/>arbitrator shall only be advisory and if, upon review of the written<br/>decision, the Board of Trustees determines that it is unable to<br/>render a final determination on record, it may reopen the record for<br/>the taking of additional evidence. The Board shall render a final<br/>and biding decision within thirty (30) days after additional evidence<br/>is taken.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure is not cumulative and this Article shall be the exclusive<br/>provision and remedy for the determination of all contract violations. A<br/>teacher instituting any action or proceeding, either by himself/herself or<br/>through a representative, in a court of law or equity, state or federal, or<br/>before an administrative tribunal, the subject matter of which constitutes a<br/>grievance, shall immediately thereupon waive any and ail rights under this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL DUES OR FEES AND PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bargaining unit members will sign and deliver to the Board, an assignment<br/>authorizing deduction of unified membership dues in the Association. Such<br/>authorization shall continue in effect from year to year unless revoked in writing<br/>by the teacher between July 1 and September 10 of any school year. Pursuant<br/>to such authorization, the Board shall deduct one-tenth (1/10<sup>th</sup>) of such dues from<br/>the regular salary check of the teacher each month for ten (10) months.<br/>Deductions for teachers who sign such authorization after the commencement of<br/>the school year shall be appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end<br/>of the school year. This will remain in effect as long as CETA/CTA/NEA is the<br/>exclusive representative. Any dispute as to dues deduction shall be between the<br/>individual teacher and the Association, and the Association agrees to save and<br/>hold the District harmless from any and all claims against the District by the<br/>teacher arising out of dues deduction under this section.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the Board pursuant to authorization of the<br/>employee for membership dues, the Board agrees to remit such moneys to CTA<br/>accompanied by a list of teachers for whom such deductions have been made.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the District to fulfill<br/>the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon appropriate written authorization from the teacher, the Board shall deduct<br/>from the salary of any teacher and make appropriate remittance for annuities,<br/>credit union, savings bonds, charitable donations, or any other plans or programs<br/>approved by the Board.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the Association or who does not make<br/>application for membership within thirty (30) days from the commencement of<br/>assigned duties within the bargaining unit, as a condition of continued<br/>employment shall become a member of the Association or pay the Association a<br/>fair share service fee. The amount of the fee shall not exceed the dues that are<br/>payable by members of the Association and shall cover the cost of negotiation,<br/>contract administration, and other activities of the Association that are germane<br/>to its functions as the exclusive bargaining representative. Payment of the fair<br/>share service fee shall be made either in a lump sum prior to November 1 of<br/>each year, or through payroll deduction in the same manner as prescribed for<br/>monthly payroll deductions for membership dues.</p>

The length of the<br/>leave of absence, including the date on which the leave shall<br/>commence and the date on which the bargaining members shall<br/>resume duties, shall be determined by the bargaining unit and the<br/>bargaining unit member’s physician. Disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery<br/>there from are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disability<br/>insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with<br/>employment by the school district. All employment policies and<br/>practices of the District shall be applied to disability due to<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and recovery from on the same<br/>terms and conditions applied to other temporary disabilities.</p>

An employee<br/>shall not be provided more than one five-month period per illness or<br/>accident. However, if a school year terminates before the five-month<br/>period is exhausted, the employee may take the balance of the five-month<br/>period in a subsequent school year. No other paid or partial paid illness or<br/>accident leave shall be granted by the District.</p>

If the member does not<br/>return to work during the 24-month or 39-month period, the member shall<br/>be taken off the reemployment list and shall lose all reemployment rights<br/>to the District.</p>
<p>C. Industrial Accident Leaves:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members will be entitled to industrial accident leave<br/>according to the provision in Education Code Section 44984 for<br/>personal injury which has qualified for worker’s compensation.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not exceed sixty (60) days during which the<br/>schools of the District are required to be in session or when the<br/>bargaining unit member would otherwise have been performing<br/>work for the District in any one fiscal year for the same industrial<br/>accident.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to have the bargaining unit member<br/>examined by a physician designated by the District at District<br/>expense to assist in determining the length of time during which the<br/>bargaining unit member will be temporarily unable to perform<br/>assigned duties and the degree to which a disability is attributable<br/>to the injury involved.</p>

<p>5) If the bargaining unit member fails to endorse to the District any<br/>wage loss disability, indemnity check received on account of the<br/>industrial accident or illness as provided above, the District shall<br/>deduct from the bargaining unit member’s salary warrant the<br/>amount such disability indemnity actually paid to and retained by<br/>the bargaining unit member.</p>
<p>D. Personal Necessity Leave: Every bargaining unit member shall be<br/>entitled to use up to eight (8) days of his/her paid sick leave<br/>allotment during each school year in case of personal necessity.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Personal Necessity” means any circumstances that are<br/>serious in nature which cannot be expected to be<br/>disregarded, which necessitate immediate attention and<br/>which cannot be dealt with during off-duty hours without<br/>causing undue inconvenience to the bargaining unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member shall not be required to secure<br/>advance permission to use Personal Necessity Leave in the<br/>cases enumerated below:</p>

<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave cannot be utilized for the<br/>purposes of work slow-down or strike against the District.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>5) Up to two (2) days per school year of the eight (8) days</p>
<p>specified above may be used for personal necessity, without<br/>the unit member having to state a reason to the District, if<br/>the unit member has sufficient days of unused sick leave at<br/>the time. Even though the reason need not be stated, these<br/>days may not be used for the reasons set forth in Section<br/>D(4) above, or for the pursuit of business, financial, or<br/>economic interest of the unit member or for vacation or other<br/>recreational pursuits, except under unusual circumstances<br/>with the advance permission of the Principal.

This leave<br/>shall not be deducted from sick leave.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury and Legal Leave: A bargaining unit member shall be entitled<br/>to as many days of paid leave as are necessary for jury duty and<br/>for required appearances in any legal proceeding involving the<br/>school district in which the District requires the attendance of the<br/>bargaining unit member at the legal proceeding. When possible,<br/>bargaining unit members called for jury duty shall give the District<br/>forty-eight (48) hours advance notice.</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members who elect to reschedule jury duty to other<br/>than non duty days shall receive compensation in the form of<br/>payment that would have been made to a substitute teacher for the<br/>length of jury service.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous - Paid Leaves: Unless otherwise provided in this<br/>Article, a bargaining unit member on a paid leave of absence shall<br/>be entitled to the following:</p>

<p>19</p>
<p>H. Catastrophic Leave:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree to the establishment<br/>of a Catastrophic Leave Bank (“Bank”) for Unit Members.</p>
<p>The intent of this Bank is to provide additional financial<br/>protection to those Unit members of the District who incur a<br/>period of prolonged illness or hospitalization, not to include<br/>routine maternity issues. A catastrophic injury or illness shall<br/>be defined as: any injury or illness which incapacitates a<br/>Unit Member for an extended period of time, based upon<br/>competent medical evidence.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be an eligible participant of the Bank, a certificated<br/>employee must have at least one (1) year of service (at least<br/>75% of the school year), must have at least ten (10) days of<br/>accumulated sick leave, and must donate one (1) day of sick<br/>leave (1 day = current daily hours assigned) during the open<br/>enrollment period and one (1) day each year thereafter, for<br/>five years. A member shall not be required to contribute<br/>after 5 years unless the bank reserve falls below 40 days. At<br/>that point, all members of the Bank must contribute on a<br/>yearly basis until the bank is above 40. No member shall<br/>contribute more than one (1) day to the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank in any one open enrollment period.</p>
<p>New members wishing to enter the Bank will be required to<br/>donate one (1) day during the open enrollment period in the<br/>year they join regardless of the total number of days in the<br/>Bank. Following the initial enrollment, a Unit Member may<br/>only join the Bank during the annual open enrollment period<br/>during the month of September. Employees hired after<br/>September 1 or returning from a approved leave of absence<br/>will have an open enrollment period of thirty (30) days<br/>following the date of employment.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave day contribution will be authorized on the<br/>appropriate form (Appendix F-1) to be completed each year<br/>during open enrollment and continue under the provisions<br/>addressed below or until canceled by the Unit Member. No<br/>sick leave may be surrendered or drawn for the purpose of<br/>summer school.</p>
<p>Donations of sick leave days to the Bank shall be<br/>irrevocable. Sick leave which is donated under this section<br/>shall be deducted from the accrued sick leave authorized<br/>under Section XII.I.A above and shall not be designated to a<br/>specific unit member for his/her exclusive use.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>A Unit Member who wishes to donate sick leave shall submit<br/>a “Certificated Sick Leave Bank Deposit” form (Appendix<br/>F-1) to the Payroll Department. This form authorizes the<br/>donation to the Bank. No withdrawal shall be effective until<br/>approved by the Joint Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank<br/>Committee. The decisions of the Committee shall not be<br/>subject to the grievance procedure, but may be reviewed<br/>upon appeal to the Committee.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Unit Member electing to use the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>shall complete an appropriate form (Appendix F-2) in order<br/>to make a draw on the bank. The Unit Member must submit<br/>this form to the Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee for<br/>processing. The Unit member must provide an attending<br/>physician’s statement which verifies the catastrophic illness<br/>or injury and gives an estimated date of return to work.</p>
<p>In the event that the Unit Member is personally unable to<br/>apply for catastrophic leave, an immediate family member or<br/>Unit Member’s agent may make the request for the<br/>applicant.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall be composed of four (4) members, two</p>
<p>(2) of whom are appointed by the District and two (2) of<br/>whom are appointed by the Association. The Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank Committee shall be responsible for receiving<br/>leave requests, verifying validity of requests, approving the<br/>full or less than full amount requested or denying requests,<br/>communicating its decision to affected unit members and the<br/>Superintendent, and soliciting donations of sick<br/>leave/vacation days from eligible unit members. A Unit<br/>Member dissatisfied with any action or decision made by the<br/>Committee concerning the Catastrophic Leave plan herein<br/>provided, may submit a request for an appeal with<br/>documentation. No request for appeal shall be considered<br/>by the Committee unless the request for appeal is submitted<br/>no later than ten (10) days after the action or decision in<br/>question. The Committee shall have no jurisdiction to hear<br/>any request which is not submitted within the required time<br/>frame.</p>
<p>The Committee shall review timely matters which are<br/>submitted to it. The Committee shall prepare a written report<br/>regarding the matter submitted to it.</p>
<p>The report shall be submitted to the District Board of<br/>Education as an information item.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>The Committee shall be responsible for informing Unit<br/>Members of solicitation for donations earmarked for the<br/>Bank. The decision of the Committee shall not be subject to<br/>the grievance procedure, but may be reviewed upon appeal<br/>to the Committee.</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten (10) days of illness or disability must be covered<br/>by the employee’s own sick leave, differential pay or leave<br/>without pay. After ten (10) days, employees who have<br/>exhausted their fully paid sick leave are eligible for<br/>withdrawal from the Bank. The District shall pay the<br/>employee’s full pay and the Bank shall be charged one sick<br/>leave day. The employee may use the remaining differential<br/>leave after exhausting the Catastrophic Sick Leave<br/>Allotment.</p>
<p>Eligibility for differential pay shall not affect the rate at which<br/>catastrophic leave is used. A unit member who receives<br/>paid leave pursuant to this section shall use any leave<br/>credits that he or she continues to accrue on a monthly basis<br/>prior to receiving paid leave pursuant to this section.</p>
<p>The maximum number of work days allowed for a member of<br/>the Bank for a single catastrophic injury/illness shall not<br/>exceed twenty (20) work days. If there are insufficient days<br/>in the Bank, there is no obligation to grant leave hereunder,<br/>in whole or in part. Neither the District, Association and/or<br/>Committee shall be legally responsible if there are<br/>insufficient days in the Bank to provide a Catastrophic Sick<br/>Leave donation.</p>
<p>The employee who receives leave from the Bank shall<br/>furnish all requested medical information deemed necessary<br/>by the Joint Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank Committee (to be<br/>referred to as the “Committee”, as defined in Section<br/>XII. 1.10). The Committee determines the Unit Member’s<br/>eligibility to receive donated leave under this Section. Upon<br/>request by the Committee, the employee shall submit a<br/>“Certificated Sick Leave Bank Request for Withdrawal” form<br/>(Appendix F-2) for the release of medical information. The<br/>Committee shall be entitled to obtain an independent<br/>medical evaluation to determine an employee’s right to<br/>receive leave from the Bank.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method of Payment: When an employee uses a day from<br/>the Bank, pay for that day shall be at the same rate the Unit<br/>Members would have received had he/she worked that day.<br/>No distinction shall be made as to the differing pay rates of<br/>the donor and the recipient.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting: By October 15 of each year, the Payroll Office<br/>shall provide bargaining unit members with a statement<br/>detailing the number of days withdrawn from the Bank during<br/>the past year and the number of days available in the Bank<br/>as of the first of July of the current year.</p>
<p>9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of Bank: If the Bank is terminated for any<br/>reason, the hours remaining in the Bank shall be equally<br/>distributed to the then-current Unit Members enrolled in the<br/>Bank.</p>
<p>10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who has submitted a request to donate sick<br/>leave, and an employee who receives leave from the Bank,<br/>shall each execute an agreement satisfactory to the<br/>Committee. The agreement will confirm the understanding<br/>of each that the donation of sick leave is voluntary. The<br/>agreement will also provide that each employee agrees to<br/>indemnify and hold the Committee harmless from any<br/>claims, demands, or causes of action related to the donation.</p>
<p>11) If any provision of this Section is held to be unlawful, then<br/>this entire Section shall be null and void. This Section<br/>supersedes any obligation of the District under Education<br/>Code section 44043.5.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIV</p>
<p>PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW PROGRAM</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree that the District in any school year,<br/>beginning on July 1, 2000, may implement the California Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Program for Teachers (PAR Program) under California Education Code<br/>Sections 44500-44508 consistent with the provisions in the Article. As<br/>specifically cited by the Legislature, the PAR Program is intended to be a “critical<br/>feedback mechanism that allows exemplary teachers to assist veteran teachers<br/>in need of development in subject matter knowledge or teaching strategies, or<br/>both.” The District and the Association also agree that the PAR Program in any<br/>school year may be contingent upon the actual receipt by the District of adequate<br/>funding from the State specifically designated for the PAR Program. The District<br/>may take any action so that the District does not lose any funding under the PAR<br/>Program as long as such action is consistent with this Article and there is prior<br/>consultation with CETA Leadership. Pursuant to Education Code Section<br/>44506(c), the District also may expend PAR program funds from the State for<br/>any other allowable purpose which includes, but is not limited to, any program<br/>that supports the training and development of new teachers as long as there is<br/>prior consultation with the CETA Leadership.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any school year which the District determines that a teacher or teachers will<br/>participate in the PAR Program, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a<br/>Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel composed of two permanent<br/>classroom teachers and the Superintendent or designee. The Joint Teacher -<br/>Administrator Review Panel shall schedule its meetings. To have a meeting,<br/>two-thirds (2/3) of the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel must be<br/>present and one (1) member must be the Superintendent or designee.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two permanent classroom teachers shall be selected by the<br/>classroom teachers in a secret ballot election conducted by the<br/>Superintendent and the Association. Classroom teachers at Cardiff<br/>School will select one (1) member, and classroom teachers at Ada Harris<br/>School will select one (1) member. In order to be on the ballot, a<br/>permanent teacher must submit a written communication to the<br/>Superintendent at least three (3) calendar days prior to the election<br/>expressly indicating a desire to be on the ballot, and also expressly<br/>indicating a commitment to perform all the required duties of the Joint<br/>Teacher - Administrator Review Panel for the school year. The<br/>Superintendent or designee and Association President may seek<br/>applications for the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher on the ballot receiving the most number of votes from the<br/>classroom teachers actually voting at each school shall be appointed to<br/>the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel. The ballots shall be<br/>counted by the Superintendent or designee and the Association President<br/>or designee.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel include the<br/>following: Select no more than three (3) consulting teachers by majority vote for<br/>the school year consistent with this Article and applicable law no later than<br/>October 15. The number of consulting teachers shall be determined by the<br/>number of teachers participating in the PAR Program which, in any year, may<br/>require no consulting teachers. As required by Education Code Section<br/>44502(c)(2), before a consulting teacher is selected, the Joint Teacher-<br/>Administrator Review Panel shall conduct at least one (1) classroom observation<br/>of the candidate which shall be arranged and scheduled by the Superintendent or<br/>designee.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review and recommend whether to combine the District’s authorized<br/>Education Code Section 44503(d)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assign each consulting teacher to a specific program participant(s) with<br/>the approval of the Superintendent or designee. If a program participant<br/>disagrees with the consulting teacher assigned to him/her, an appeal may<br/>be made in writing to the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel.</p>
<p>Any such appeal must be made within five (5) calendar days and must<br/>specify the reason(s) for the appeal. The Joint Teacher - Administrator<br/>Review Panel shall make the final decision on whether to continue the<br/>assignment of the consulting teacher.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make confidential written recommendations to the Governing Board<br/>regarding participants in the PAR Program, including forwarding the<br/>names of any participants in the PAR Program who, have sustained<br/>improvement. These written recommendations will be reviewed in closed<br/>session. Members of the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel<br/>shall not disclose the confidential written recommendations except to the<br/>Superintendent or designee and the Governing Board.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annually evaluate the impact of the PAR Program and submit<br/>recommendations for improvement to the Governing Board and the<br/>Association no later than June 15<sup>th</sup>. This annual evaluation may include,<br/>but is not limited to, interviews or surveys of program participants.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any consulting teachers selected by majority vote of the Joint Teacher -<br/>Administrator Review Panel shall meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any permanent classroom teacher who has experience as classroom<br/>teacher for at least five (5) out of the last seven (7) years.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstrated exemplary teaching ability, as indicated by, among other<br/>things, effective communication skills, subject matter knowledge, and<br/>mastery of a range of teaching strategies necessary to meet the needs of<br/>pupils in different contexts.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No disciplinary action by the Governing Board or any administrator within<br/>the last four (4) years including no Notice of Unprofessional Conduct<br/>under Education Code Section 44938(a), no Notice of Unsatisfactory<br/>Performance under Education Code Section 44938(b), and no evaluation<br/>document designating any needs improvement or unsatisfactory<br/>performance.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a member of the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel who<br/>meet all the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of any consulting teachers shall include the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional assistance to program participants to improve teaching skills<br/>and subject matter knowledge. Education Code Section 44500(b)(4)<br/>provides that there shall be a cooperative relationship between the<br/>consulting teacher and the principal with respect to the process of peer<br/>assistance and review. The professional assistance should include, but<br/>not limited to, specific written suggestions for improvement, sample<br/>instructional materials, possible specific lesson plans, and advice on<br/>available resources.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare written peer review reports of program participants and submit<br/>them to the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel no later than May<br/>31<sup>st</sup>. the peer review reports shall be based upon clear performance goals<br/>established at the beginning of the peer review process which shall be in<br/>writing, aligned with pupil learning, and consistent with Education Code<br/>Section 44662 (a provision in the Stull Act.)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer review reports also shall be based on no less than four (4) classroom<br/>observations of at least thirty (30) minutes each for each program<br/>participant, and on no less than two (2) conferences with each program<br/>participant regarding classroom observations. Since the classroom<br/>observations require release time for the consultant teacher, such<br/>observations must be scheduled with the approval of the principal.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent classroom teacher shall become a program participant under any of</p>
<p>the following two (2) conditions:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the previous school year the teacher received any unsatisfactory<br/>rating on an evaluation report completed by an administrator.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher volunteers to participate and the Joint Teacher -<br/>Administrator Review Panel and the Superintendent or designee agrees to<br/>the participation.</p>
<p>If, in any school year, there are no program participants, the<br/>Superintendent or designee, after consultation with CETA Leadership,<br/>may determine to provide professional assistance under the PAR program<br/>generally to all classroom teachers, to reduce or eliminate consulting<br/>teachers, and to utilize PAR Program monies for various activities such as<br/>curriculum development or staff development.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer review reports completed by the consulting teacher shall be placed in the<br/>personnel file of the program participant, the Joint Teacher - Administrator<br/>Review Panel, and the Superintendent or designee. A volunteer program<br/>participant may determine that any peer review report shall be placed in his/her<br/>personnel file. Peer review reports are confidential documents which should be<br/>treated as such. Both the program participant and the Superintendent or<br/>designee may submit a written response which will be attached to the peer<br/>review report in the personnel file prior to the end of the ten (10) day period. A<br/>written response by the program participant is the sole remedy to the peer review<br/>report. A peer review report is not a substitute for an evaluation by an<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee may remove a teacher selected to the Joint<br/>Teacher - Administrator Review Panel, and may terminate the selection of a<br/>consulting teacher, after consultation with the Joint Teacher-Administrator<br/>Review Panel. A replacement shall be selected as soon as possible consistent<br/>with the relevant provision in this Article.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two (2) classroom teachers selected to the Joint Teacher - Administrator<br/>Review Panel and any consultant teachers selected by the Joint Teacher -<br/>Administrator Review Panel are not considered to be either management or<br/>supervisory employees for purposes of the Educational Employment Relations<br/>Act.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two (2) permanent classroom teachers on the Joint Teacher - Administrator<br/>Review Panel will be required to perform duties related to their assignment on<br/>the Joint Teacher - Administrator Review Panel outside of the regular word day,<br/>each teacher shall receive hourly pay for PAR duties performed outside of the<br/>regular work day.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since any consulting teacher will be required to perform duties related to his/her<br/>assignment as a consulting teacher outside of the regular work day, each shall<br/>receive an annual stipend of $1,500 for each teacher who is a participant in the<br/>PAR Program and who is actually served by the consulting teacher for an entire<br/>school year. This amount shall be prorated if the service is for less than an entire<br/>school year. However, if the funding actually received during the school year<br/>from the State specifically designated for the PAR Program is less than budgeted<br/>and anticipated amount, then the stipend will be decreased by an amount<br/>proportional to the decrease in State funding.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program participants shall receive no additional compensation because of their<br/>participation in the PAR Program.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining funds actually received during the school year from the State<br/>specifically designated for the PAR Program may be used by the Superintendent<br/>or designee for various activities such as curriculum development or staff<br/>development, substitutes and other educational activities, as long as there is<br/>prior consultation with CETA Leadership.</p>
<p>Only provisions 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are subject to the Grievance Procedure.</p>
