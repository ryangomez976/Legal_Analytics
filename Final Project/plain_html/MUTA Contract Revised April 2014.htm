<p>ARTICLE VIII: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>Page 10</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose:</p>
<p>Evaluation is one means by which to improve the quality of<br/>education provided to students. It is an ongoing process focused<br/>on the means by which an individual can more effectively<br/>contribute to the educational efforts of the District. It is based<br/>upon an objective and fair assessment of performance.<br/>Evaluation is a self-enlightening activity, which occurs in an<br/>atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Its primary purpose is<br/>to improve instruction.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher evaluation has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five primary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goals:</p>
<p>8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve instruction:</p>
<p>8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To benefit students and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificated staff:</p>
<p>8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain and exceed professional standards:</p>
<p>8.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote ongoing and significant professional growth.</p>
<p>8.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recognize and affirm good teaching practices.</p>
<p>8.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process adopted for the evaluation of Teachers by the Mesa</p>
<p>Union School District emphasizes these goals by recognizing<br/>effective teaching practices and providing constructive<br/>assistance.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By following specific guidelines and clearly observable criteria,<br/>the evaluator and Teacher are able to communicate using a<br/>common frame of reference and mutually understood evaluation<br/>standards. Teachers receive feedback primarily based upon<br/>classroom observations, student performance, and discussion of<br/>instructional planning and implementation.</p>
<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Evaluation Instrument (El) is to explain the<br/>Teacher evaluation process in the Mesa Union School District.<br/>The processes and forms have been formulated jointly by the<br/>Mesa Union Teachers’ Association (MUTA) and the Mesa Union<br/>School District (MUSD) and are to be utihzed along with the<br/>agreements contained in Article VIII, Evaluations, in the<br/>Agreement between MUSD and MUTA.</p>

The CSTP will guide<br/>Teachers as they define and develop their practice. The CSTP<br/>shaU estabhsh the guidelines for analyzing satisfactray<br/>performance of certificated employees.</p>
<p>Standards for Teachers shall be the six standards of teaching<br/>practice contained in the CSTP document.</p>
<p>Administrators and all certificated staff shall be responsible for<br/>maintaining and modeling professional standards at all times.<br/>As administrators observe in classrooms or work settings, they<br/>have the responsibility to identify any concerns related to the<br/>professional standards and to communicate those concerns to<br/>the Unit Member.</p>

Additional visitations may also be<br/>required by the option chosen. A conference between the<br/>evaluator and the Teacher shall be scheduled not more than 10<br/>(ten) school days after any observation, if the observation is to<br/>be used as part of the appraisal procedure.</p>
<p>Administrators have the right and responsibility to observe<br/>classrooms or work settings at any time. As administrators<br/>observe in classrooms or work settings, they have the right and<br/>responsibihty to identify any concerns related to the CSTP.</p>
<p>Self-Asses sment</p>
<p>Each year, all Teachers shall conduct a Self-Assessment. The<br/>Self-Assessment instrument shall be in the Continuum of<br/>Teacher Abdities, which is a continuum of the standards and<br/>sub-standards of the CSTP.

<p>A Teacher shall not be obligated to share his/her Self-<br/>Assessment with anyone.</p>
<p>Teachers shall sign the Self-Assessment completion form (Form<br/>A of El). Each year stating they have completed the Self-<br/>Assessment outlining their goals and objectives for the year.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of administrators to monitor and provide<br/>support to Teachers with respect to their goals and objectives.</p>
<p>Standards Based Evaluation</p>
<p>The formal Evaluation Instrument for Teachers will consist of<br/>four (4) options. A hst of timelines/deadlines and materials<br/>detailing the professional accountability process shall be<br/>distributed to all Teachers at the beginning of the school year.<br/>This professional accountabihty program has four goals:</p>
<p>To improve instruction:</p>
<p>To benefit students and Teachers:</p>
<p>8.12.1.3</p>
<p>8.12.1.4<br/>8.12.2<br/>8.12.2.1</p>
<p>8.12.2.1.1</p>
<p>8.12.2.2</p>
<p>8.12.2.3</p>
<p>.8.12.2.4</p>
<p>Page 15</p>
<p>To maintain and exceed professional standards;</p>
<p>To promote ongoing and significant professional growth.</p>
<p>The options are:</p>
<p>Standards Based Administrative Mandated Evaluation -</p>
<p>This option is for probationary, temporary, emergency, or<br/>categorical (non-permanent) Teachers and requires the Unit<br/>Member and an administrator to jointly develop a working<br/>portfoho, an ongoing collection of evidence that addresses the<br/>goals, based on goals developed from analysis of a self-<br/>assessment of the Continuum of Teacher Abihties, and if<br/>necessary, from previous evaluation. Probationary, temporary,<br/>emergency, or categorical (non-permanent) employees will be<br/>evaluated annually on the Mandated Administrative Option for<br/>their first two years. The first year after tenure is granted<br/>employees will be placed on the Standards Based Administrative<br/>Evaluation Option.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall be completed in sufficient time so<br/>that each Teacher shall receive his/her evaluation no later than<br/>March 15. The evaluator shall make formal observations of not<br/>less than 40 minutes. Probationary, temporary, and emergency<br/>employees with less than two years of teaching experience may<br/>be required to participate in the Beginning Teacher Support and<br/>Assessment Program (BTSA).</p>
<p>Standards Based Administrative Evaluation - This option<br/>is similar to Administrative Mandated with a tenured Unit<br/>Member choosing to investigate student work, abilities and<br/>behaviors. The Unit Member writes a summative self-<br/>assessment and the administrator adds comments. Teachers in<br/>their first year of tenure must use this option.</p>
<p>Standards Based Partner Evaluation - This option is a peer<br/>coaching model in which Teachers collaborate and coach each<br/>other to determine success of professional development goals.<br/>Portfolio Based Evaluation - This option is based on an area<br/>of investigation where a Unit Member develops a portfolio with<br/>reflections to validate professional development. The Unit<br/>Member writes a summative evaluation which the administrator<br/>reviews and may add comments.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XIII: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each June, the District and three (3) MUTA representatives will concur on class<br/>size(s) for the fall with each side providing input to ensure reasonable and<br/>balanced classes.</p>
<p>13.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and MUTA recognize that pursuant to Education Code section<br/>42238.02, and as a condition for receiving additional funding for Transitional<br/>Kindergarten (“TK”) through 3<sup>rd</sup> grade Grade Span Adjustment under the Local<br/>Control Funding Formula (“LCFF”)= the District must make progress (as defined<br/>in Education Code 42238.02) toward maintaining, at each school site, an average<br/>class size enrollment in grades TK-3 of not more than 24 pupils upon full<br/>implementation of LCFF (currently set for 2020). The District and MUTA intend<br/>for the District to be in compliance with this law as interpreted by subsequent<br/>guidelines and regulations of the California Department of Education. The<br/>District and MUTA recognize that as part of the unplementation of Grade Span<br/>Adjustment in TK through grade 3, the parties must negotiate District-specific<br/>annual class size enrollment language for each District school site.</p>
<p>13.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and MUTA agree that effective the 2014-2015 school year, and until<br/>either otherwise negotiated or applicable statutes/regulations are amended to not<br/>require class size maximums, the District shall implement an alternative annual<br/>average class size enrollment for grades TK-3 at each school site within the<br/>meaning of Education Code section 422308.02(d)(3)(B).

<p>13.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any tune the District leams that compliance with the foregoing contractual<br/>provisions will likely result hi penalties which would reduce or eliminate the<br/>additional funding grant for TK-3 Grade Span Adjustment, or for any individual<br/>grade within the Grade Span Adjustment, or if the District determines it will not<br/>receive sufficient funding for TK-3 Grade Span Adjustment, the parties agree to<br/>immediately meet and negotiate to implement a mutually agreed resolution.</p>

<p>kindergarten and first grade classroom. Depending on availability of funds, the<br/>District will have discretion in assigning instructional aide time to primary or split<br/>grade classes which, due to large enrollment, would warrant assistance.</p>
