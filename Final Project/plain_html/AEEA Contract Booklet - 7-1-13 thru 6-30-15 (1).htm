<p>The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on<br/>the issue or issues that were submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p>However, if the District claims the grievance is not arbitrable and should be<br/>dismissed for reasons which do not go to the merits (e g. mootness, untimeliness,<br/>subject matter beyond the scope of the grievance procedure) the District may<br/>cause its claim to be heard and ruled upon by an arbitrator prior to the arbitrator<br/>hearing the merits. If the District plans to invoke this claim, it shall so advise<br/>AEEA prior to the selection of the arbitrator to hear the merits of the alleged<br/>grievance. An arbitrator shall then be selected to hear this arbitrability claim.</p>
<p>The arbitrator to hear the arbitrability claim shall be selected pursuant to this<br/>section. If this arbitrator determines the grievance is arbitrable, he/she shall be<br/>selected to hear the merits unless there is mutual agreement of the parties. If the<br/>arbitrator determines the grievance is not arbitrable, such decision shall<br/>terminate Level IV.</p>
<p>3.3.5 The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, add to, or subtract from the terms of<br/>the Agreement. The District and the Association shall not be permitted to assert<br/>to such arbitration proceeding any ground or rely on any evidence not previously<br/>disclosed.

<p>4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documentation generated through the PAR Program shall be treated as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel</p>
<p>records and shall be confidential to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>5.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Provi sions</p>

<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the majority of the members are unit members, these provisions are not subject to the<br/>grievance procedure contained within the collective bargaining agreement between these parties,<br/>nor to any grievance procedure contained within Board Policies or District Regulations.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the PAR Program may be revised by written mutual consent of the District and<br/>the Association at any time.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Program shall be contingent upon the continuation of direct State funding.</p>

<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the CLP is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in the CLP shall be returned<br/>proportionately to all current and former members of the CLP who are current employees of the<br/>District (as allowable under retirement system rales).</p>
<p>3. Eligibility, Contributions, and Withdrawals</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All full-time, permanent unit members who have been on active duty with the District (with the<br/>exception of breaks in service due to layoff) for at least the last two (2) consecutive years are<br/>eligible to contribute to the CLP.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires contribution to the CLP. Only contributors will be<br/>permitted to withdraw from the CLP. Unit members who elect not to enroll in the CLP upon<br/>first becoming eligible will have to wait until the open enrollment period the following year in<br/>order to become eligible.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will donate and receive a day for a day.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual contribution rate by each participating unit member for each school year shall be one</p>
<p>(1) day or eight (8) hours of sick leave.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial Participation: In order to participate, unit members must have at least twenty (20)<br/>days of accrued sick leave remaining after donating to the CLP.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing Participation: Ongoing participation of existing members shall be permitted<br/>even if the participant's remaining accrued sick leave falls below twenty (20) days after<br/>the required annual donation.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any year a unit member is active in the CLP, the unit member may request to withdraw days,<br/>subject to the terms of the program.</p>
<p>i. An active CLP member is a unit member who has donated in the current school year OR<br/>who has donated for three years and has had his/her donations suspended.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member uses a day from the CLP, pay for that day shall be the same rate the unit<br/>member would have received had the unit member worked that day.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the CLP exceeds 250 actual days, the Committee may suspend donations for one (1) year<br/>for all current members who have contributed for at least three (3) years. Members with less<br/>than three years of contributions will need to continue contributing each year for up to the three</p>
<p>(3) years.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donated days not used in any given year shall be carried over for use in subsequent years and<br/>shall remain a part of the CLP. If, in any given year, the request(s) for utilization exhausts the<br/>number of days in the CLP, the CLP will be closed for the remainder of the year. By mutual<br/>agreement, the District or Association can agree to solicit unit members for an additional<br/>donation of days.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first fifteen (15) days of illness or disability must be covered by the unit member’s own<br/>sick leave, differential leave, vacation, or leave without pay the first time said unit member<br/>qualifies for withdrawal from the CLP. A unit member who receives donated sick leave credits<br/>must use any leave credits, differential pay, including any vacation that he or she continues to<br/>accrue on a monthly basis, prior to receiving/using additional donated sick leave credits from the<br/>CLP.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CLP is available to all active CLP members for use during their work years (12 month unit<br/>members may apply to use the CLP year round; all other employees are eligible according to<br/>their regular work year).</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of time for which donated sick leave credits may be used is 50 days for<br/>any one catastrophic illness. The lifetime benefits from the CLP may not exceed a total of 100<br/>days.</p>
<p>l. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CLP may not be used if the unit member applies for or has purchased any other benefit or<br/>disability insurance policy or income protection program either public or private unless the total<br/>benefit is less than 100% of the unit member’s basic salary. Unit members having any<br/>additional income benefit must apply for that benefit before they are considered eligible for the<br/>CLP. The receipt of donated sick leave credit through the CLP as defined herein, when<br/>combined with other District income, or income protection plan, shall not provide the recipient<br/>with a greater monthly District income/fringe benefit contribution than he/she received<br/>immediately prior to the receipt of catastrophic sick leave.</p>
<p>m. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No days provided to a unit member from the CLP shall extend that unit member’s leave benefits<br/>beyond the current school year, ending annually on June 30.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an immediate family member of the unit member is incapacitated and this requires the unit<br/>member to take time off work for an extended period to care for the family member, the unit<br/>member may use CLP days as deemed by the Committee and request them using the same<br/>procedure as if the request was for the unit member. Immediate family members are defined as<br/>spouse or domestic partner, or the unit member’s children. A unit member’s child shall be</p>
<p>defined as a biological child, legally adopted child, legal ward, or a step child living within the<br/>home of the unit member.</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any fraudulent or inappropriate use of donated days will result in the unit member returning any<br/>resulting overpayment of wages. The overpayment of wages will be converted by the District to<br/>days returned to the CLP. The number of days returned shall equal the number of days<br/>fraudulently or inappropriately used by the unit member.</p>
<p>p. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf or on the behalf of any unit<br/>member, any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind related to any attempt by a unit member to<br/>retrieve donated sick leave used by another unit member pursuant to this provision. The<br/>Association also agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf or on the behalf of any unit<br/>member, any grievance, claim, or lawsuit of any kind which attempts to challenge in any way<br/>the legality or implementation of this document.</p>
