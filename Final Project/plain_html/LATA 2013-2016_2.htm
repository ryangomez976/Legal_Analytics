<p>For those employees in the bargaining unit as set forth in the paragraph below: The Los Altos<br/>School District Board of Trustees (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;School Board&quot;) hereby<br/>recognizes the Los Altos Teachers Association, the California Teachers Association, and the<br/>National Education Association (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Association&quot;) as the exclusive<br/>negotiating representative of certificated employees as defined in Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540<br/>through 3549.3 of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the<br/>Act&quot;) excluding substitutes and hourly employees.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclusive Representative</p>
<p>The School Board recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative of all certificated<br/>employees of the School Board -- excluding substitutes and hourly employees, management,<br/>confidential and supervisory employees, as defined in &quot;the Act,&quot; -- for the purposes of meeting<br/>and negotiating. These exclusions include Management Personnel including Superintendent,<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Business Manager, Principals and Vice Principals. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION AND UNIT MEMBER RIGHTS</p>
<p>2.1 Personal and Academic Freedom</p>
<p>2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic Freedom</p>
<p>Academic freedom shall be guaranteed to all persons covered under this Agreement and no<br/>arbitrary limitations shall be placed upon study, investigation, presentation, and<br/>interpretation of facts and ideas concerning people, society, the physical and biological<br/>world, and other branches of learning.</p>
<p>2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controversial Issues</p>
<p>It is recognized and agreed that the welfare of students is served through the introduction<br/>and open exchange of ideas, materials and positions which might be deemed to be<br/>unpopular or controversial.</p>
<p>2.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of Speech</p>
<p>Freedom of individual expression will be encouraged and fair procedures will be developed<br/>to safeguard the legitimate interests of the schools and to exhibit by appropriate example<br/>the basic objectives of a democratic society. The management team is available to assist<br/>the unit member and provide suitable materials for objective presentation as outlined in<br/>employer's policy #6134. The School Board shall not interfere with the unit member's<br/>freedom of speech or use of materials in the classroom unless such speech or materials<br/>constitute a clear and present danger to the students or the District.</p>
<p>2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary Action</p>
<p>In no event shall the employer take action against a unit member for statements made or<br/>materials used in the classroom unless such statements or materials were specifically in<br/>violation of School Board policies.</p>
<p>2.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Life</p>
<p>The employer shall not interfere with or inquire into the personal life of any member of the<br/>bargaining unit. Each unit member is entitled to full constitutional rights of citizenship; and<br/>the unit member's religious, personal, and political activities will not be grounds for<br/>discipline or discrimination with respect to professional employment, as long as they do not<br/>interfere with the classroom instruction.</p>
<p>2.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupil Grades</p>
<p>Grades given students by a unit member shall be final and not subject to alterations by any<br/>person except that unit member unless fraud, bad faith, incompetency, or mistakes can be<br/>shown on the part of said unit member.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>2.1.7 Recording Devices</p>
<p>Education Code Section 51512 is hereby made a part of this Agreement and supplemented<br/>as follows: No mechanical, electric or photographic device will be installed or used on a<br/>temporary or permanent basis, by means of which any person would be able to listen to or<br/>record procedures without the knowledge and consent of the unit member involved. The<br/>District may continue to use its public address systems for general communication<br/>purposes.</p>
<p>2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Examinations</p>
<p>2.2.1</p>
<p>A pre-employment statement by the applicant's physician or</p>

<p>All unit members shall be required to comply with the provisions of Education Code Section<br/>49406.</p>

<p>4.3.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>This Catastrophic Leave Bank is established pursuant to Education Code section 44043.5.</p>
<p>4.3.10.1 Eligibility</p>
<p>4.3.10.1.1</p>
<p>To qualify for Catastrophic Leave, a permanent unit member must have<br/>suffered an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate him/her for an<br/>extended period of time, or that incapacitates the unit member's spouse, child,<br/>or domestic partner (registered with the State of California) and that<br/>incapacity requires the unit member to take time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time to care for that family member, and taking extended<br/>time off from work creates a financial hardship for the bargaining unit member<br/>because all of her or his sick leave and other paid time off has been<br/>exhausted.</p>
<p>4.3.10.1.2</p>
<p>Unit members with permanent status who have suffered an illness or injury<br/>that is expected to incapacitate him/her for an extended period of time and<br/>have exhausted all applicable paid leaves provided for in the collective<br/>agreement, including differential pay and District provided disability insurance,<br/>may apply for Catastrophic Leave under this Article.</p>
<p>4.3.10.1.3</p>
<p>When unit members with permanent status whose spouse, child, or domestic<br/>partner have suffered an illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate that<br/>spouse, child or domestic partner for an extended period of time, and the unit<br/>member has exhausted all applicable paid leaves provided for in the collective<br/>bargaining agreement, excluding differential pay and District provided<br/>disability insurance, said unit member may apply for Catastrophic Leave under<br/>this Article.</p>
<p>4.3.10.1.4</p>
<p>Unit members who are eligible to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank must also<br/>have a minimum of ten sick leave days available to them either current or<br/>accumulated, after they have made their donation to the bank. The number of</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>sick leave days available to unit members shall be prorated based on the unit<br/>member's full time equivalency.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave, combined with all other available leaves, shall not exceed<br/>a cumulative maximum of one hundred and eighty five (185) days per unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave shall be taken in full day increments. The use of<br/>differential pay will follow, when appropriate, the use of the allocated<br/>Catastrophic Leave days.</p>
<p>4.3.10.1.5</p>
<p>Participation in the Catastrophic Leave Bank is voluntary. Unit members who<br/>wish to participate will donate at least one (1) sick day upon joining. Further<br/>donations may be required when the committee calls for them. Newly tenured<br/>unit members will have thirty (30) calendar days during the month of<br/>September to elect to participate. Only those who donate may receive<br/>contributions from the Bank. If a unit member decides to discontinue<br/>participation in the Bank, the unit member may rejoin during an open<br/>enrollment period during the month of September. Days which are donated to<br/>the bank shall be irrevocable.</p>
<p>4.3.10.2 Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee</p>
<p>4.3.10.2.1</p>
<p>A Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee shall be established that includes three</p>
<p>(3) voting unit members appointed by the Association and one non-voting<br/>consultant appointed by the District. Association appointees shall serve a three<br/>year term. The Committee shall be responsible for administering the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank in accordance with this Agreement and applicable<br/>state law. The Committee's duties are:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving leave requests;</p>

<p>74</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10</p>
<p>TEMPORARY UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>Sections 44918 through 44921 of the Education Code are incorporated into this Agreement and<br/>supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>10.1</p>
<p>A certificated employee who is hired to take the place of a probationary or permanent employee<br/>who is on a leave of determinate length may be designated as a temporary unit member.</p>
<p>10.2</p>
<p>Such unit members shall be entitled to all benefits provided for in this Agreement except for those<br/>described in Article 3, section 3.9.12; and those benefits listed in Article 4 insofar as such<br/>exclusion from benefits is consistent with the law.</p>
<p>10.3</p>
<p>Such unit members shall be paid on the same schedule as full-time teachers.</p>
<p>10.4</p>
<p>Temporary unit members who serve during one school year for at least 75% of the number of<br/>days the regular schools of the district were maintained in such school year and have performed<br/>the duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school district shall be considered<br/>for employment after permanent and probationary full-time unit members who have been<br/>dismissed due to ADA decline or elimination of positions and after placement of all full-time<br/>permanent and probationary unit members returning from leave.</p>
<p>10.5</p>
<p>Temporary unit members who serve during one school year for at least 75% of the number of<br/>days the regular schools of the district were maintained in such school year and have performed<br/>the duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school district shall receive priority<br/>consideration over new applicants in the filling of vacancies for one (1) year following conclusion<br/>of their temporary contract.</p>
<p>10.6</p>
<p>The following criteria shall be used in the placement of such unit members in this order:<br/>Appropriate credential;</p>
<p>Length of service when appropriate; and</p>
<p>Other criteria (cited in Article 5, Transfers) when appropriate.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall require the filling of a vacancy with a temporary unit member when<br/>governing California law allows the vacancy to be filled with a substitute.</p>
<p>10.7.1</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Article a vacancy is a position which will be vacant for at least one</p>
<p>(1) semester and which is currently assigned to a probationary or permanent certificated<br/>employee on leave of absence.</p>
<p>10.8</p>
<p>If the District determines that a temporary teacher is not exhibiting acceptable teaching skills or<br/>otherwise not fulfilling the obligations of the position, then the District shall have the right, after<br/>an evaluation process has been undertaken, to terminate the temporary unit member prior to the<br/>time the temporary period was to be completed. The process to be followed shall be as follows:<br/>After observations and a written evaluation have occurred as delineated in Article 6 of the<br/>collective bargaining agreement, the principal may recommend termination of the unit member to<br/>the Superintendent within three (3) days after the principal has formally and in writing<br/>recommended termination and served such papers on the unit member. The Superintendent will<br/>(if requested by the unit member) hold a meeting among himself, the principal, and employee,<br/>and the employee's representative (if requested by the unit member) to review the written<br/>evaluation and the recommendation for termination. Within twenty-four (24) hours of the<br/>conclusion of the conference, the unit member may request one final observation and evaluation<br/>by the Superintendent or his designee (other than the building principal), a copy of which will be<br/>shared with the employee. Should the Superintendent continue to feel that termination is<br/>necessary, he will recommend termination to the Board of Education in writing with a copy to the<br/>unit member. Within three (3) days of the notification the employee may request a hearing before<br/>the Board of Education to review the evaluations and recommendations of the principal and<br/>Superintendent before final action is taken. This is not intended to imply that the unit member's<br/>contract will not terminate as originally specified. This shall apply to situations where the unit<br/>member is terminated prior to the end of his/her term of employment. It is not intended to place<br/>any restrictions upon the District's right to terminate the unit member at the end of his/her period<br/>of employment.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11</p>
<p>PART-TIME ASSIGNMENT</p>

<p>ARTICLE 23</p>
<p>COLLABORATION</p>
<p>Collaboration is based on shared responsibility and decision making, and flexibility in achieving<br/>the mutual goals of the administration, teachers and the community. This process results in a<br/>range of services for children which can be supported in a number of different environments<br/>ranging from the regular education classroom to the special day class. The areas cited below<br/>support the collaborative process and help develop strong team building in the Los Altos School<br/>District.</p>
<p>23.1 SITE FACILITATORS</p>
<p>The purpose of having site facilitators is to provide unit members with a vehicle to discuss and<br/>make recommendations about issues important to member(s) at the site. It is a way to facilitate<br/>conversation between members and themselves, and between member(s) and the administration.</p>
<p>23.1.1</p>
<p>Unit members at each site will select 2-3 members as site facilitators. Site facilitators will<br/>be selected by a simple majority vote through a closed ballot election.</p>
<p>23.1.2</p>
<p>The term of the selected facilitators will be for one school year beginning from the first<br/>teachers' day of school to the next one. Site facilitators for the next year will be elected at<br/>each school by May 15<sup>th</sup> of the preceding school year. The election process will be the<br/>responsibility of the LATA building representative.</p>
<p>23.1.2.1</p>
<p>Facilitators should serve staggered terms so that there is always at least one<br/>experienced facilitator on the team.</p>
<p>23.1.2.2</p>
<p>Principals will not be present when staff members elect the facilitators.</p>
<p>23.1.3</p>
<p>The individuals selected will receive at least a half day of training provided by the unit (i.e.,<br/>team building, collaboration).</p>
<p>23.1.4</p>
<p>In order to foster collaboration, site facilitators will meet regularly with the site<br/>administrator. Site facilitators will also meet regularly with unit members on their site.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Confidentiality will be maintained at each site.</p>
<p>23.1.6</p>
<p>All district site facilitators will meet together at least once during the school year to discuss<br/>the effectiveness of the program / model.</p>
<p>23.2 INCLUSION</p>
<p>Currently, inclusion in our district means that students with disabilities receive instruction<br/>regularly accessed by non-disabled peers. Students participate consistently in academic and non-<br/>academic school settings as delineated in the IEP.</p>
<p>23.2.1</p>
<p>Inclusion should be handled using a team approach. The Inclusion Team (the psychologist,<br/>classroom teacher, special education teacher, principal, and parents) will work together to<br/>meet the educational needs of the student. Each Inclusion Team will select one member to<br/>be the chair for the academic year.</p>
<p>23.2.2</p>
<p>The success of the program for the special needs student will be evaluated regularly by the<br/>Inclusion Team with attention to the successful functioning of the general education class<br/>as a whole.</p>
<p>23.2.3</p>
<p>Teachers will be provided with the training they need to support the special education<br/>children in their classrooms (i.e., curricular modification, behavior management, etc.)</p>
<p>23.2.4</p>
<p>All para-professionals in classrooms using inclusion will be trained in behavior management<br/>and teaching strategies.</p>
<p>23.2.5</p>
<p>Classroom teachers will be provided planning time to meet with the special education<br/>teacher, psychologist, etc. on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>23.2.6</p>
<p>Classroom teachers will be provided by the district with support materials when needed<br/>(modification of curriculum, appropriate texts, manipulatives, etc.)</p>

<p>Rights and Responsibilities of Part-Time Teachers</p>
<p>APPENDIX C</p>
<p>RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PART-TIME TEACHERS</p>
<p>The following guidelines will be inserted as an appendix to the LATA contract, and should be<br/>followed wherever possible by both teachers and administrators. These guidelines apply to<br/>teachers who are part-time at one school, including teachers who are job sharing, or to teachers<br/>whose assignment is split between two schools. District traveling team members (music, P.E.,<br/>etc.) are not included in these guidelines.</p>
<p>The guidelines were developed by a team of teachers, both part-time and full-time, and<br/>administrators.</p>
<p>Compensation Time for Travel: See LATA Contract, Article 9, section 9.4 which applies to<br/>classroom teachers assigned to more than one school.</p>
<p>Orientation Dav: All part-time teachers should attend the district orientation meeting and any<br/>faculty meeting held that day.</p>
<p>SIP In-Service Davs: As part of their professional responsibilities, all part-time teachers should<br/>attend district and school in-service meetings on professional days. For teachers who are<br/>assigned to two schools, the principals will decide which meeting the teacher should attend.</p>
<p>Teacher Work Days: On teacher work days (e.g. Semester Break), teachers should attend all<br/>meetings and be at school for the same proportion of the total day that they teach.</p>
<p>Back to School / Open House Nights: Part-time teachers should attend these. Teachers who are<br/>assigned to two schools will get a .5 comp day if they must attend Back to School nights on two<br/>different evenings. If the two schools have Back to School night on the same night, the principals<br/>will coordinate the schedule to accommodate traveling teachers.</p>
<p>Staff Meetings: Part-time teachers should attend the same proportion of staff meetings that they<br/>work at school, and the designation of which meetings are essential are left to the principal.<br/>Teachers are responsible for finding out about decisions made when they are not present at<br/>meetings, and principals are responsible for making that information available.</p>
<p>Duties: All duty assignments should be proportional to time worked at that school.</p>
<p>IEP / Conferences: When parents of a student will be present at a conference or an IEP meeting,<br/>part-time teachers will attend the meeting if possible.</p>
<p>Planning and Coordination: As with all teachers, part-time teachers are responsible for arranging<br/>time at school beyond their teaching day to coordinate with other teachers at their grade level<br/>and subject areas.</p>
