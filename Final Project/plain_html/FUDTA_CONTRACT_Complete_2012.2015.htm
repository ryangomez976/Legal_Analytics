<p>Association business on school property at reasonable times.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall grant a leave to the President of the Association or the President’s designee<br/>during the term of office. A request shall be made and granted reasonably in advance. The<br/>Association shall be billed at the cost of the lowest cell on the salary schedule. Each year of the<br/>President's term of office (leave) shall constitute a full year’s employment in the District, and<br/>the President shall be entitled to all benefits and rights granted full-time employees. The<br/>District shall return the Association President from this leave to the same site and assignment<br/>that the President would have held had the person not been on leave, if that person elects to<br/>return.</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to purchase release time, at the appropriate substitute rate<br/>of pay, for a reasonable number of teachers working on Association business.

<p>3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall select any and all unit member representatives to joint<br/>District/Association committees and to any District committees which have unit members on<br/>them as long as this committee membership is not prescribed by law or Code to be selected in<br/>some other manner.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4: DISTRICT RIGHTS</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to manage the school District and to direct its employees and operations is vested<br/>in and reserved by the District and shall be unrestricted except that exercise thereof may not<br/>diminish any lawful right or benefit expressly provided for in this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement supersedes any past practice except as specifically provided for in this<br/>Agreement and it supersedes any previous agreement, oral or written, between any of the<br/>parties hereto or between any of them and any unit members and such is not grievable or<br/>admissible in evidence in any except Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) or court<br/>proceedings.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practices by the District or Association in operating under this Agreement may infer rights<br/>and prerogatives not contained in this Agreement. However, such practices, unless<br/>specifically provided for in this Agreement, may not be asserted in grievance proceedings or<br/>other proceedings as limiting the District's or the Association's right to change practice at<br/>any time, so long as such change does not diminish expressed rights and benefits contained in<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may take action on any matter expressly within this Agreement in the event of<br/>an emergency. An emergency is defined as a sudden, unforeseen situation that is caused by<br/>factors beyond the control of the District and which requires immediate action to avoid<br/>disaster. Any alleged violation of this provision may be grieved directly at the arbitration<br/>level of the grievance procedure of this Agreement.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the District to exercise and/or implement any rights expressly provided for in this<br/>Agreement shall in no way extinguish and/or diminish the District's right to do so in the<br/>future in accordance with the PERB Decision Number 314 (Marysville).</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall have all rights accorded the District by California Education Code and all<br/>applicable laws.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit member who is a member of the FUDTA/CTA/NEA, or who has applied for</p>
<p>membership, may sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of<br/>unified membership dues, initiation fees, and general assessments in the Association.</p>
<p>Pursuant to such authorization, the District shall deduct one-tenth (1/10) of such dues from<br/>the regular salary check of the unit member each month for ten (10) months or as necessary to<br/>complete payment by June 30.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the duration of this Agreement, any unit member who is not a member of the</p>
<p>FUDTA/CTA/NEA or who does not make application for membership within thirty (30)<br/>days of the effective date of this Agreement, or within thirty (30) days from the<br/>commencement of assigned duties, shall become a member of the Association or pay to the<br/>Association a fee in an amount not to exceed the unified membership dues and general<br/>assessments required for Association membership, payable to the Association in one lump¬<br/>sum cash payment. In the event that a unit member shall not pay such fee directly to the<br/>Association, the District shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in<br/>California Education Code 45061 and in the same manner as set forth in Article 5.1.</p>
<p>5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the event a unit member is a member of a recognized sect and cannot conscientiously</p>
<p>support the concept of organizational security because of religious objection, the unit<br/>member shall file a declaration to that effect with both the District and the Association<br/>stating that the deducted fee be directed to the Lions Club Student Optometry Fund, the Red<br/>Cross, or the Fremont Education Foundation.</p>
<p>5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit member shall sign and deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of</p>
<p>the service fee or contribution to the Association or specified charities pursuant to Article 5.3.<br/>Such authorization shall continue in effect until the termination of this Agreement. Pursuant<br/>to such authorization, the District shall deduct such fees or contributions from the unit<br/>member's regular salary check. For audit purposes, the list of unit members authorizing such<br/>deductions shall be made available to the Association.</p>
<p>5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written request by the Association, the District shall be responsible for requiring any</p>
<p>unit member to fulfill the obligations under Articles 5.1,5.2, and 5.3 as a condition of<br/>employment.</p>
<p>5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association agrees to pay to the District all reasonable legal fees and legal costs incurred</p>
<p>in defending against any court action and/or administrative action challenging the legality or<br/>constitutionality of the agency fee provisions of this Agreement or their implementation. The<br/>Association also agrees to pay any judgment or settlement liability arising out of such<br/>challenges. The Association shall have the right to decide and determine whether any such<br/>action or proceeding referred to above shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended,<br/>tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As problems arise, good morale is maintained by sincere efforts of all persons concerned to<br/>work toward constructive solutions in an atmosphere of courtesy and cooperation. The<br/>purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, equitable<br/>solutions to grievances, which from time to time arise. The proceedings used to effect a<br/>solution shall be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance shall be a written complaint by a grievant involving a violation, misapplication,<br/>or misinterpretation of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Grievant<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members, or the Association in the course of</p>
<p>processing a grievance.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the timelines<br/>indicated at each procedure level are maximum, and every effort should be made to expedite<br/>the process. Timelines, however, may be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>6.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance procedural level shall begin the school day</p>
<p>following receipt by the parties of the grievance, grievance appeal, or written<br/>decision.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be recognized at any procedural level commencing with Level One or Level Two, a<br/>grievance shall have been presented at the appropriate level within thirty (30) school days of<br/>the act/omission giving rise to the grievance.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the District to comply with the terms and conditions of Level One and Level Two<br/>shall automatically confer upon the grievant the right to appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the grievant to comply with the terms and conditions for appeal from Level One or<br/>Level Two shall be considered as a waiver of all appeal rights.</p>
<p>6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedural&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;levels&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bypassed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such an action would expedite the process, by</p>
<p>mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance is of such a nature as to require immediate action, the grievant, or the grievant’s<br/>representative, may file immediately to the office or person empowered to act, and said office<br/>or person shall resolve the matter jointly with the grievant or the grievant’s representative. If<br/>the matter is not satisfactorily resolved, it may be appealed using the grievance procedure at<br/>Level Three.</p>
<p>6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed or unresolved on or after May 1 which, if left unresolved until<br/>the beginning of the following school year, could result in harm to a party, the timelines set<br/>forth herein shall be reduced so that the grievance procedure may be exhausted prior to the<br/>end of the school term. The grievance procedure may be continued during the summer, by<br/>mutual agreement.</p>
<p>6.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member may at any time present a grievance to the District and have such grievance<br/>adjusted without the intervention of the Association, the exclusive representative, as long as<br/>the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and is consistent with the terms of the<br/>Agreement, and provided that the District notifies the Association of all grievances upon<br/>receipt. The District shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the Association has<br/>received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the<br/>opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>6.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall<br/>be filed separately from the personnel files of the unit members. All grievance documents<br/>shall be located in the office of the Superintendent and/or in a centralized, secure place that<br/>the Superintendent designates and so notifies the Association.</p>
<p>6.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any claim by a grievant or by the Association that reprisals are occurring for the<br/>filing of grievances or participation in the grievance procedures shall be<br/>investigated by the Superintendent/designee. Within seven (7) working days,<br/>the Superintendent shall respond to the reprisal complaint. The<br/>Superintendent’s response may be appealed to Level Three.</p>
<p>6.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall have equal access to documents and school District records within the<br/>policies of confidentiality that are in conformity with state law and policy, which will assist<br/>in adjusting complaints.</p>
<p>6.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the right of any unit member or the<br/>Association having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member<br/>of the administration and have the grievance adjusted.</p>

<p>grievant may, within five (5) school days of the receipt of the decision from<br/>Level Two, request in writing to the Association that the grievance be<br/>submitted to Arbitration. (Article 6.16 below)</p>
<p>6.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Level&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three):</p>
<p>6.16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance is not resolved at Level Two, and the grievant chooses to pursue<br/>the grievance to Level Three, the Association, by written notice to the<br/>Superintendent within thirty (30) school days after receipt of the Level Two<br/>decision, may submit the grievance to Arbitration.</p>
<p>6.16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time during the thirty (30) school days, at the request of either party,<br/>there shall be a settlement conference for the purposes of reaching a mutually<br/>acceptable agreement prior to Arbitration.</p>
<p>6.16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parties&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mutually acceptable arbitrator. Should they be unable</p>
<p>to agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) school days of the Association's<br/>submission of the grievance to Arbitration, a joint request for an arbitration<br/>panel shall be made to the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The<br/>parties will then be bound by the rules and procedures of the AAA. The parties<br/>may agree to the expedited arbitration procedures of the AAA.

<p>(payout) by the District of more than $20,000 to the grievant or other unit<br/>members similarly situated even if they were not grievants. In cases where the<br/>potential aggregate award exceeds $20,000, the grievant or Association may<br/>seek remedy in any court of competent jurisdiction; the District waives any<br/>requirement for utilization/exhaustion of the grievance procedure in such cases.</p>

<p>10</p>
<p>On the first workday of the school year, the principal shall post a list of Additional Required Time<br/>Assignments that includes hours dedicated to meetings and hours required for supervision of<br/>students at extra-and co-curricular activities.</p>
<p>On the first work day of the school year, or as soon thereafter as possible for itinerant unit<br/>members, a unit member shall sign up for Additional Required Time.

<p>Additional Required Time for secondary sites may only be added to with consent from a majority<br/>of bargaining unit members at each individual secondary site. All Additional Required Time<br/>duties shall have a reasonable/expected time commitment, developed by agreement between<br/>members of site administration and FUDTA site reps, which shall be included when presented to<br/>staff prior to signing up for these Additional Required Time duties.</p>

<p>possible, within the continuous Instructional Day. The special nature of the<br/>multiple school assignments of non-classroom personnel, such as nurses and<br/>speech/language pathologists, shall be taken into consideration when<br/>scheduling SST meetings so that they will not be required to work beyond a<br/>continuous Instructional Day except in unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>Loss of Preparation Period</p>
<p>7.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District may assign a teacher to substitute according to the procedures in</p>

<p>7.9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary</p>
<p>At the start of the school year, the principal shall establish and<br/>post a list of the preparation periods of all unit members at the<br/>site. This list also shall accurately indicate the number of times a<br/>unit member has been required to substitute. The number of<br/>times one has been required to substitute in the previous year will<br/>determine the placement on the subsequent year's list. The<br/>principal will be responsible for ensuring that the appropriate unit<br/>members are notified of their turn in the rotation.</p>
<p>A substitute, who is working at a site that day, shall be offered the<br/>first opportunity to volunteer to fill an unfilled absence before<br/>assigning other unit members. If a substitute is not available, a<br/>unit member may volunteer to fill an unfilled absence. A unit<br/>member who volunteers for substitute duty shall be noted and<br/>shall be offered a position before other unit members are assigned.</p>

<p>*9.1</p>
<p>Transfer</p>
<p>All voluntary transfers and related procedures contained in this Article or this Agreement<br/>shall be implemented, applied and construed so as to be fully compliant with California<br/>Education Code 35036.</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree that seniority is one of the effective criteria for<br/>determining the transfer process.</p>
<p>Transfer is a voluntary request by a unit member for change in assignment between<br/>schools. A unit member shall be given the opportunity to apply for a transfer with or without<br/>giving reasons. A request for transfer must be submitted on the Transfer Request Form,<br/>specifying the grade and/or subject, and site. The Human Resources Department shall<br/>provide the Transfer Request Form. The following information shall be on the Transfer<br/>Request Form:</p>
<p>Transfer requests shall be kept confidential. The principal, and the District supervisor, in<br/>the case of District-assigned personnel, of the unit member seeking a transfer shall not<br/>be informed of the transfer request unless the transfer request has been granted.&quot;</p>
<p>Transfer requests shall be kept on file by the Human Resources Department from time of<br/>submission until September 30. All qualified unit members requesting transfers shall be<br/>offered an interview, for transfers occurring up to and including April 15, to be conducted by<br/>the principal, and should include a department chairperson or grade level representative,<br/>and one (1) other unit member selected by the site unit members, before a position is filled<br/>by the principal.</p>
<p>*9.1.1 The District shall consider the following factors before filling a posted vacancy by</p>
<p>means of a transfer occurring on or before April 15:</p>
<p>9.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available vacancies and number of requests for transfer.</p>
<p>9.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade level, subject field, and position for which the unit member<br/>is best suited by qualifications and experience. The qualifications<br/>and experience that shall be considered include preparation, (i.e.<br/>coursework, training, workshops, professional experience) written<br/>annual evaluations, and length of service as a unit member in the<br/>District. Length of service is defined as the number of years of<br/>continuous service in the District with a regular credential including<br/>leaves of absence for the purpose of further study. Seniority shall be<br/>defined as in Article 21.3.5.</p>
<p>When a transfer involves a change of subject field, the change<br/>may be made only if the unit member meets the qualifications<br/>currently required for that specialty in terms of subject field<br/>preparation and teaching credential.</p>
<p>*9.1.1.3 All the above factors being equal, appropriately credentialed and<br/>certificated unit members who apply for a transfer shall be<br/>selected based upon their seniority within the District and shall be<br/>given preference in granting a transfer request for transfers<br/>occurring up to and including April 15. A transfer candidate unit<br/>member may request reasons, in writing, as to why the person being</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>transferred was selected.</p>
<p>9.1.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pool of Excess Certificated Employees (PECE)</p>
<p>The PECE is created whenever there are displaced permanent or<br/>probationary unit members due to District-wide loss of enrollment,<br/>school closures, class size changes, budget constraints, credentialing,<br/>etc. who will be substituting on a daily basis.</p>
<p>9.1.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer to PECE:</p>
<p>When there is a District-wide need for staff reduction, a unit<br/>member may volunteer to be placed in the PECE even though the<br/>reduction is not at the unit member’s site, provided the following<br/>conditions are met:</p>
<p>9.1.1.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a qualified PECE unit member willing to<br/>exchange and to fill the volunteer unit member’s<br/>position.</p>
<p>9.1.1.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal agrees to the transaction.</p>
<p>9.1.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until such time as all unit members in the PECE have been placed<br/>in a regular position, no person shall be hired from outside the<br/>District unless there is no unit member on the existing staff<br/>with the required credential.</p>
<p>9.1.1.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unassigned unit members shall be offered vacant</p>
<p>positions for which they are qualified at the time the<br/>vacancy occurs.</p>
<p>Transfer Procedure</p>
<p>The transfer procedure shall be coordinated by the Human Resources Department.<br/>Explanations of the procedures, including forms, timelines, etc., for the current year shall be<br/>developed by the District, with input from the Association, by February 15. Transfer forms<br/>are available in the Human Resources Department and on the District's web page.</p>
<p>*9.2.1 The District shall fill vacancies in the following order:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on the PECE List;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on the Unassigned List;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent/Probationary unit members requesting transfer for transfers<br/>occurring up to and including April 15;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary unit members on Rehire List for transfers occurring up to and<br/>including April 15;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New hires who may be interviewed and chosen to fill vacancies on an equal<br/>basis with, and without any priority given to, unit members for transfers<br/>occurring after April 15 in accordance with Education Code section 35036.</p>
<p>9.2.2 The District shall officially add new open positions to the subsequent monthly<br/>Vacancy List as soon as they are declared vacant by the Human Resources<br/>Department.</p>
<p>9.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vacancy List Timelines, including transfer unit member interviews through</p>
<p>and including April 15, shall be from April 1 through August.</p>
<p>9.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of vacancies shall be posted on the first school day in<br/>April, the first Monday of May, the first Monday of June, the second<br/>Monday in July, and the first Monday in August. Each Vacancy List<br/>shall remain posted and open for a period of ten (10) working days.</p>
<p>9.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All vacancies shall be posted on the District’s web page, on bulletin<br/>boards easily accessed in the Human Resources Department, at<br/>each school site, and by hard copy to the Association.</p>
<p>9.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancy List process shall be as follows.</p>
<p>*9.2.4.1 First school day in April:</p>
<p>After all unit members on the PECE and Unassigned Lists have been<br/>placed, the April posting shall be open to</p>
<p>permanent/probationary unit members for transfers occurring on or<br/>before April 15; such list shall thereafter be available and open to all<br/>(including outside) applicants. The April posting shall be a cumulative<br/>list of all known vacancies, including leaves of absence, and shall<br/>remain posted and open for a period of ten (10) workdays. At the<br/>close of the ten (10) work day posting period, all<br/>permanent/probationary unit members who notify, or have<br/>previously notified the Human Resources Department of their wish to<br/>interview for the accumulated vacant positions, and all outside<br/>applicants shall, if selected for an interview, be notified of a time<br/>and place of interview(s) to be scheduled for each vacancy for which<br/>the unit member and outside applicants have applied and been<br/>selected for an interview. Such interviews shall occur at the<br/>close of the ten (10) workday period and shall be conducted in<br/>accordance with Article 9.1. When there are no applicants for a<br/>transfer vacancy, the Human Resources Department will send to site<br/>principals the names of temporary contract unit members on the<br/>Rehire List.</p>
<p>9.2.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return from Leave of Absence</p>
<p>Fall Semester Leave:</p>
<p>A unit member on leave for the fall semester or longer<br/>shall submit an Intent to Return Notice or equivalent<br/>notification to the Human Resources Department on or<br/>before February 15. A unit member who does not submit<br/>notice according to this timeline shall automatically be<br/>placed on the Unassigned List. A principal may make<br/>tentative assignments without reference to unit those<br/>members. See Article 8.I.4.4.</p>
<p>Spring Semester Leave:</p>
<p>A unit member on a spring semester leave shall submit<br/>an Intent to Return Notice or equivalent notification to<br/>the Human Resources Department on or before the<br/>last workday in March. A unit member who does not<br/>submit notice according to this timeline shall</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>those unit members. See Article 8.I.4.4.</p>
<p>*9.3</p>
<p>*9.4</p>
<p>9.5</p>
<p>*9.2.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Monday in May and June and second Monday in July:</p>
<p>Beginning with the posting on the first Monday in May, each monthly<br/>Vacancy List shall reflect all new vacancies known since the previous<br/>month's posting. The posting shall be open for a period of ten (10)<br/>workdays. At the close of the ten (10) workday period, all qualified<br/>and credentialed applicants for positions shall be considered.</p>
<p>*9.2.4.3 First Monday in August:</p>
<p>All new or unfilled vacancies as of the first Monday in August shall be<br/>posted for a period of ten (10) workdays and shall be open for<br/>transfer on an equal basis to all unit members who have been<br/>rehired and outside applicants.</p>
<p>9.2.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All remaining unfilled positions from the April Vacancy List as of the<br/>first Monday in August shall be sent to the Association office.</p>
<p>9.2.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All vacancies occurring after the August posting shall be temporarily<br/>filled by new hires. These positions may be reconfigured by the<br/>principal, and will appear as vacancies on the following April Vacancy<br/>List. A unit member shall be able to transfer to vacant positions at<br/>other times only with the mutual agreement of the Association and<br/>the District.</p>
<p>9 2.4.6 The interviewing principal shall notify all transfer applicants when a<br/>specific position for which the unit member has applied is filled.</p>
<p>A unit member employed for less than full-time shall be allowed to apply for<br/>vacancies any time in the year that would permit increasing the unit member’s<br/>proportion of full-time and will have priority over new hires for vacancies existing prior to<br/>April 15.</p>
<p>After April 15, a part-time unit member who applies to fill a vacancy should be considered a<br/>viable candidate and may be given an interview along with outside applicants if<br/>appropriately credentialed, certificated, and experienced in the grade level (K-6, 7-8, or<br/>9-12) or content area of the vacancy.</p>
<p>An Adult School unit member who is appropriately credentialed and certificated<br/>may apply to transfer to vacancies in the K-12 education program. An Adult School unit<br/>member shall be given interviews and considered as a viable candidate for transfer and<br/>will have priority over new hires in accordance with California Education Code 35036.</p>
<p>Exchange Transfers</p>
<p>9.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transfer opportunities will be made available. An exchange transfer is</p>
<p>defined as a transfer that shall occur when two or more unit members and their<br/>respective principals agree in writing to an exchange of the unit members'<br/>respective positions of employment. Exchange transfers arrangements shall<br/>take place between March 16 and June 1.</p>
<p>9.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duration&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchange shall be agreed to in advance, in writing,</p>
<p>by all unit members and principals involved. No exchange transfers shall be<br/>implemented or renewed without the written agreement of all unit members and<br/>principals involved.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>9.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member wishing to make an exchange transfer will fill out a request<br/>form stating the grade level and/or subject area to be exchanged and the<br/>grade level and/or subject area of interests. This form shall be placed in the<br/>District Exchange Transfer Register. Files from this register shall be open to<br/>examination by any unit member who has filed an Exchange Form with the<br/>District. If, upon such examination, a unit member finds a potential<br/>transfer, the unit member shall be responsible for the initial contact<br/>with the other applicant. If both parties agree that they wish to<br/>proceed in attempting to bring about an exchange transfer, they shall<br/>proceed by contacting their present principals and informing them of their<br/>intention. Contact will then be made with the prospective new<br/>principals to set times and places for interviews.</p>
<p>9.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interviews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall take place within ten (10) school days after initial contact</p>
<p>has been established between applicant and the potential new principal. No<br/>principal will interview for an occupied position unless expressly requested<br/>to do so by the unit member holding the position.</p>
<p>9.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-wide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seniority&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;held&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchange transfer unit members</p>
<p>shall remain in effect at the unit members’ original school sites.</p>
<p>9.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member may nullify the written Exchange Transfer Agreement</p>
<p>only prior to the start of the assignment.</p>
<p>9.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transfer shall be temporary. An exchange transfer may be made</p>
<p>permanent by mutual agreement of all unit members and principals involved.<br/>In cases of a permanent exchange transfer, the seniority numbers shall follow<br/>the unit members to their new sites.</p>
<p>9.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment</p>
<p>Reassignment is the District-initiated change in a unit member’s assignment between</p>
<p>schools for all or any portion of an assignment.</p>
<p>9.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earliest possible advance notice of intended</p>
<p>reassignment.</p>
<p>9.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for reassignment shall be stated in writing, upon request of the unit</p>
<p>member. Reasons given shall not be subject to arbitration, unless provided for<br/>elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>
<p>9.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a unit member is reassigned, the following procedures shall</p>
<p>be followed:</p>
<p>9.6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the intent to reassign shall be discussed with the unit<br/>member at a mutually agreed upon time.</p>
<p>9.6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference shall include a discussion of the reasons for<br/>reassignment, which shall be furnished in writing.</p>
<p>9.6.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reassigned unit member shall have the right to apply for any<br/>subsequent vacancy for which the unit member is qualified, unless<br/>otherwise specified at the time of the reassignment.</p>
<p>9.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surplusing</p>
<p>Surplusing is a District-determined excess of unit members at a department/site,</p>
<p>including reasons of credentialing and/or certification.</p>
<p>9.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall use the following procedures:</p>
<p>9.7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Level: The District shall determine if there is excess FTE<br/>at a given school.</p>
<p>9.7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Level: After determining the department(s) affiliated with<br/>every unit member at the site (any department in which the unit<br/>member has ever taught and is credentialed and certificated to teach at<br/>the site), the District shall determine if there is any excess FTE in a<br/>given department.</p>
<p>9.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If surplusing is necessary, the following steps shall be adhered to in the order<br/>presented:</p>
<p>9.7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place excess FTEs in vacancies based on credentials and certification.<br/>The District shall not save a position for any past, present, or future<br/>unit member, except as provided for in this Agreement (e.g. teacher on<br/>leave, etc.).</p>
<p>9.7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid surplusing any unit member, the District shall first<br/>discuss the possible assignments/positions with each affected unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>9.7.2.2.1 Give consideration to the unit member’s input and<br/>preference for assignment.</p>
<p>9.7.22.2 Reconfigure positions for excess FTEs. The</p>
<p>reconfiguration cannot be to the detriment of the<br/>educational needs of the site.</p>
<p>9.7.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timelines described in Articles 11.10,11.10.1 and 11.10.2 shall be</p>
<p>observed.</p>
<p>9.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surplusing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unavoidable,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for volunteers at the site to go</p>
<p>onto the Unassigned List.</p>
<p>9.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surplusing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unavoidable,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volunteer(s)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to go onto the</p>
<p>Unassigned List, the District shall surplus unit members in the following<br/>manner:</p>
<p>9.7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary Level: The unit member with the highest seniority number<br/>at the site shall be surplused.</p>
<p>9.7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary Level: The unit member(s) with the highest seniority<br/>number in the affected department(s) shall be surplused unless<br/>the unit member(s) is/are the only unit member(s) available at the site<br/>credentialed to teach a specific class(es) included in the approved<br/>curriculum. In such case, the unit member in the department with<br/>the next highest seniority number is surplused.</p>
<p>9.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member is surplused for reasons of English Language (EL)</p>
<p>certification, the following procedures shall be followed.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>9.7.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, the intent to surplus shall be discussed with the unit<br/>member at a mutually agreed upon time.</p>
<p>9.7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference shall include a discussion of the reasons for<br/>surplusing, which shall be furnished in writing.</p>
<p>9.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return Rights of Surplused Unit Members</p>
<p>The District shall afford unit members who are surplused return rights as<br/>described below:</p>
<p>9.7.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member surplused because of declining enrollment or staff<br/>reduction shall have the right to return to the original school in<br/>reverse order of that in which the unit member was surplused,<br/>provided a request for such transfer be made within one (1) year<br/>from the date the unit member was surplused.</p>
<p>9.7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal preference of a surplused unit member as to new<br/>assignments shall be honored in order of seniority and before<br/>transfers or new hires are placed or assigned.</p>
<p>9.7.7 School Closures</p>
<p>A unit member in a school to be closed may go to vacancies at the school(s)<br/>to which the students have been transferred and, when two (2) classes at<br/>one (1) grade level or subject field are involved, the senior unit member has<br/>choice between the schools or may opt to be placed on the Unassigned<br/>List. When there are no available positions in the District, the unit member<br/>will be assigned to the PECE according to the provisions in Article 9.I.I.4.</p>
<p>9.7.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies shall be offered at a general staff meeting at the<br/>closing school. At the meeting, unit members shall be informed of<br/>all the options before the selection process begins. Once a unit<br/>member makes a selection, new positions cannot be selected by the<br/>unit member except through the transfer process.</p>
<p>9.7.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority determines placement at a site where there is both<br/>declining enrollment and increased staffing requirements due to<br/>another site’s closure.</p>
<p>9.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;erm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permit</p>
<p>A unit member who is asked by the District to obtain limited-term permits in order to<br/>cover classes for which there are no regularly credentialed unit members available shall be<br/>reimbursed for the cost of the permit application upon submission of reimbursement<br/>forms. The Human Resources Department shall forward the reimbursement form to those<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>9.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability of Transfer, Reassignment and Surplusing Information</p>
<p>9.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principal,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resources&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>Association shall maintain a copy of the Agreement provisions in this Article<br/>readily available to all unit members.</p>
<p>9.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;List&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specify&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;site,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;area&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each vacancy,</p>
<p>whether the vacancy is for the following school year or for the remainder of<br/>the current school year, and whether the vacancy is to be filled by an interim or</p>
<p>9.10</p>
<p>9.11</p>
<p>9.12</p>
<p>permanent appointment. Vacancies created by a unit member taking a leave<br/>of one (1) year or less will be filled on an interim basis.</p>
<p>Should the strict application of this article, District-wide seniority, credentials, and/or<br/>certification, be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to violate State and Federal laws<br/>governing discrimination based upon sex, ethnic background, age, affirmative action<br/>requirements or similar laws, the District shall make the assignment according to the<br/>order of the court.</p>
<p>If a school's changing population mandates replacing a non-bilingual unit member with a<br/>bilingual unit member, the District shall seek volunteers prior to surplusing any unit<br/>member. If surplusing becomes necessary, the unit member with the highest seniority<br/>number with the appropriate credential and certification shall be surplused.</p>
<p>Extra Duty Assignments</p>
<p>9.12.1 All positions for extra duty assignments in Appendix E (Coaching Activities<br/>and Extra Duty Compensation) of this Agreement shall first be posted at the site<br/>when the vacancy is first known to exist, for a minimum of two (2) weeks. If<br/>there are no qualified or willing candidates at the site, the position will be posted<br/>by the Human Resources Department for a minimum of two (2) weeks.</p>

<p>10.15.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist a unit member to overcome a weakness and improve effectiveness.</p>
<p>10.15.3.1 A Conference and Improvement Plan should be mutually<br/>developed following the process in Article 10.12.5.1 if a unit<br/>member is not satisfactorily performing according to the<br/>Standards or Responsibilities and Duties of the Profession initially<br/>determined on the Evaluation Planning Form and the evaluator<br/>documents areas of weakness on Informal and/or Formal<br/>Observation Forms.</p>
<p>Any Informal or Formal Observation that could lead to an Adverse Remark(s) which might<br/>appear on the Final Evaluation Form shall be brought to the unit member’s attention and<br/>supported by written documentation of the observed area of weakness. It shall be attached to<br/>the Informal or Formal Observation Form. The Notice of Potential Adverse Evaluation<br/>Form will be used for this purpose.

<p>Advisory Committee</p>
<p>10.17.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, on any matter, a unit member and evaluator cannot agree, an Advisory<br/>Committee will be formed to resolve the issue.

<p>Professional Growth</p>
<p>21.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encourages unit members to take additional academic training,</p>
<p>which must be earned at accredited institutions. A unit member shall be<br/>encouraged to take content and cultural courses, as well as education methods<br/>courses, which can reasonably be expected to strengthen the unit member’s<br/>background for the assignment. Upper division or graduate course work, in<br/>which the unit member received a minimum grade of C or Credit, shall be<br/>recognized by advancement as specified in the salary schedule. Lower division<br/>courses may be taken for credit only if prior approval is granted by the Human<br/>Resources Department.</p>

<p>Registered Nurse (RN) license shall receive one-half semester unit in-service<br/>credit for each eight (8) hours of course work. Courses taken shall be treated in<br/>the same manner as accredited university courses under terms of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>Pay Period</p>
<p>Both the District and the Association recognize the importance of developing payroll<br/>practices, which are as prompt and efficient as possible. The parties also recognize that<br/>technical problems sometimes preclude adherence to exact timelines in processing payroll.<br/>The District shall form a committee, which shall include representatives of the Association<br/>and any other bargaining units affected for the purpose of studying payroll practices and<br/>making recommendations to the Office of Business Services.</p>
<p>21.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certificated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the option of being paid for the ensuing</p>
<p>school year in ten (10) or twelve (12) equal payments. A unit member who<br/>serves less than a full school year shall receive a pro-rated salary in an amount<br/>that bears the same ratio to the established annual salary for the position as the<br/>time the unit member serves in the annual school term. (California Education<br/>Code Sections 45038, 45039, 45040, 45041).</p>
<p>21.2.1.1 The parties agree to joint participation in a study of the feasibility<br/>of phasing in a uniform practice for all.</p>
<p>21.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay unit members on the last workday of the month. Except,</p>

<p>County Office of Education and notify the Human Resources Department<br/>before any payments may be made to the unit member. In addition, the unit<br/>member must file transcripts with the District.</p>
<p>21.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;payroll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;procedures for direct deposit of a member’s</p>

<p>21.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new unit member shall be placed on the schedule according to the number of<br/>years of previous school experience up to and including five (5) years. One (1)<br/>year's experience is defined as at least 75% of the teaching days under a contract<br/>requiring a valid public teaching credential/certificate during a given school<br/>year in a full-time teaching or administrative position. Substitute teaching shall<br/>not be applied as credit to meet this requirement</p>
<p>21.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only semester equivalent units taken at an accredited college or university and<br/>completed and submitted by September 30 or within 30 calendar days of the<br/>date of hire, whichever is later, shall be acceptable for initial placement on the<br/>salary schedule for a new unit member.

<p>21.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated unit member must have transcripts on file in the Human<br/>Resources Department verifying academic classifications for placement on the<br/>salary schedule.</p>
<p>21.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority</p>
<p>The term “District-wide seniority,&quot; used in this Agreement, refers to length of<br/>service in a unit position as described below.</p>
<p>21.3.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever two (2) or more unit members are eligible for the same<br/>right or benefit under this Agreement, and when the same right or<br/>benefit must be awarded to fewer than all such eligible unit<br/>members, entitlement to the right or benefit shall be determined<br/>based upon the number of years of service in a bargaining unit<br/>position. The right or benefit shall be awarded to that eligible unit<br/>member with the greater number of years of such service. This<br/>shall apply only to those sections where seniority is not a<br/>determining factor.</p>
<p>21.3.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year of service is to be credited for each school year during<br/>which the unit member is in employment status with the District<br/>in a position within the bargaining unit, or on leave from such<br/>position.</p>
<p>21.3.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that two (2) or more unit members eligible for the<br/>same right or benefit have the same number of years of service,<br/>their relative seniority for that right or benefit shall be determined<br/>by random drawing conducted with an Association representative<br/>present.</p>
<p>Salary Schedule Provisions for Current Unit Members</p>
<p>21.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member employed for a part-time assignment shall receive pro-rated</p>

<p>28.2</p>
<p>28.3</p>
<p>28.4</p>
<p>28.5</p>
<p>All communications involving discipline or that could potentially lead to discipline shall be<br/>done in a private manner and in a private setting.</p>
<p>A unit member is entitled, upon request, to representation prior to questioning by District<br/>management personnel in an instance in which the answers elicited reasonably could be<br/>expected to lead to disciplinary action against the unit member.</p>
<p>Disciplinary action in the form of dismissal shall be in accordance with the appropriate<br/>provisions of the California Education Code.</p>
<p>Disciplinary action in a form less than dismissal shall be in accordance with the following<br/>provisions:</p>
<p>28.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciplined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discipline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be</p>
<p>limited to oral warning, written reprimand, and suspension, including<br/>suspension without pay.</p>
<p>28.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following just cause guidelines shall be recognized:</p>
<p>28.4.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall be adequately informed or reasonably<br/>should have known that there would be disciplinary consequences<br/>resulting from the unit member’s conduct before such<br/>consequences can be applied.</p>
<p>28.4.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s rules, regulations and policies shall be readily<br/>available to unit members and shall relate to the effective<br/>operation of the District.</p>
<p>28.4.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fair and reasonable investigation shall include a review of<br/>pertinent information, an informal discussion with the unit<br/>member, and a written statement of the incident or misconduct<br/>which form a basis for the disciplinary action.</p>
<p>28.4.2.3.1 All persons involved in an incident shall be<br/>interviewed if they agree to be interviewed.</p>
<p>28.4.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules, orders, and penalties shall be applied fairly, according to the<br/>circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>28.4.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary action shall reasonably relate to the nature of the<br/>offense.</p>
<p>Progressive Discipline</p>
<p>28.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discipline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an oral warning and after a second instance</p>
<p>of a similar infraction, proceeds to a written reprimand. These procedures shall<br/>be utilized except for those types of misconduct that are of such nature that<br/>progressive discipline normally is not required.</p>
<p>Progressive discipline shall be administered according to the following<br/>sequence:</p>
<p>28.5.1.1 The principal/supervisor shall conduct an informal discussion</p>
<p>with the unit member to ascertain facts and to attempt to resolve</p>
<p>28.6</p>
<p>the issue. The principal/supervisor shall inform the unit member<br/>that the progressive discipline procedure may be used as a result of<br/>this discussion, and that the unit member is entitled to<br/>representation. This event may not be considered in any future<br/>disciplinary action unless the unit member is properly notified of<br/>all of the consequences as set forth herein.</p>
<p>28.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal/supervisor shall issue an oral warning prior to the<br/>issuance of any written reprimand, unless the conduct is of such<br/>an extreme nature that prior oral warning is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Oral reprimand shall be given in private with the right to<br/>appropriate representation pursuant to Articles 28.1 and 28.2<br/>unless circumstances warrant immediate action (shop floor rule).</p>
<p>28.5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written reprimand shall be submitted to the unit member and<br/>the unit member shall have an opportunity to respond prior to the<br/>placing of such document in the Personnel File. Upon written<br/>request, the unit member may have the written reprimand<br/>reviewed by an Assistant Superintendent prior to its placement in<br/>the file.</p>
<p>28.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not impose the next higher level of discipline unless the prior</p>
<p>incident occurred within the previous eighteen (18) months.</p>
<p>28.5.2.1 Those types of misconduct which are of such nature that<br/>progressive discipline normally is not required shall be as<br/>established in California Education Code 44932 and all other<br/>applicable government codes. These acts would require at least a<br/>written warning and, at a maximum, a recommendation for<br/>dismissal.</p>
<p>28.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elements&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progressive discipline shall be administered in a timely manner.</p>
<p>All meetings upon in which oral warnings or written reprimands, are to be<br/>considered, shall be scheduled within ten (10) working days of District's<br/>knowledge of any occurrence giving rise to warning or reprimand. Failure of the<br/>District to issue such reprimand within five (5) working days after the meeting<br/>shall prohibit issuing of the reprimand.</p>
<p>28.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is required to attend any meeting dealing with oral<br/>warnings, written reprimands, or possible disciplinary action such as<br/>suspension, demotion, dismissal, or non-renewal shall be afforded the<br/>opportunity to select a representative and shall be notified, at least three (3)<br/>school days before such meeting takes place, of the topics and subject matter of<br/>such meeting in order that the unit member may adequately prepare a position<br/>on such topics and/or subject matter.</p>
<p>The unit member has the right to waive the hearing.</p>
<p>In the event that the Superintendent or a designee believes that the unit<br/>member's presence on campus presents an immediate danger to the unit<br/>member or others, the meeting shall be scheduled at an off-campus location.</p>
<p>Prior to administering formal discipline, the District shall provide notice to the unit member<br/>and an opportunity to be heard. Such written notice shall include a statement of the<br/>incidents or misconduct which form the basis for disciplinary action and a statement of the<br/>discipline to be imposed. Such notice shall be given within five (5) school days of the</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>decision to administer formal discipline. Upon receipt of such notice, the unit member shall<br/>be given ten (10) school days within which to reply, in writing. The proposed formal<br/>discipline shall not be imposed until after the unit member's written reply has been, or<br/>should have been, received and given consideration by the administration or until appeal<br/>processes are complete.</p>
<p>28.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any initial suspension of a unit member pending disciplinary proceedings shall be with pay.<br/>A unit member being suspended with pay shall be given an opportunity for a conference with<br/>the administrator intending to impose the suspension and the Superintendent or a designee.<br/>Every effort shall be made to hold the conference the same day the incident occurs or is<br/>reported. In extraordinary circumstances, if it is necessary for the District to suspend prior<br/>to the exhaustion of the grievance procedure, it shall be with pay. Suspension shall not be<br/>delayed if the unit member requests a postponement to seek representation. Extraordinary<br/>circumstances shall be limited to those situations in which the principal or a designee<br/>reasonably believes that the unit member’s continued presence at the school site would pose<br/>a danger to the students, staff, or to the unit member. An expedited arbitration hearing shall<br/>follow upon request of the unit member dealing with the issue of suspension with pay. This<br/>procedure shall not be applicable to the right of the District to suspend employees pursuant<br/>to California Education Code Sections 44939,44940, or 44942.</p>
<p>28.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may be represented, upon request, at any disciplinary meeting or hearing.</p>
<p>28.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to suspending a unit member with or without pay, a hearing shall, upon request, take<br/>place at the Assistant Superintendent level.</p>
<p>28.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actions shall be administered in a fair manner.</p>
<p>28.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases where discipline is reduced to writing, the unit member shall be permitted a<br/>reasonable amount of time to consult with the unit member’s representative to receive<br/>assistance and advice in preparing a rebuttal or reply.</p>
<p>28.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filed alleging violation of the above provision regarding discipline less than</p>
<p>dismissal may be filed at Level Two of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>28.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to expedited arbitration for any grievance involving<br/>discipline.</p>

<p>Peer Assistance and Review Program</p>
<p>The Fremont Unified District Teachers Association and the Fremont Unified School District strive to<br/>provide the highest quality education to the students of Fremont.

<p>31.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAR Budget: The budget shall consist of the funds allocated by the state for this<br/>program. The budget shall not exceed this allocation. When the District’s<br/>existing Mentor Program sunsets in June 2001, all funding from the existing<br/>Mentor Program shall be converted to the PAR Program. A maximum of 5% of<br/>these funds shall be allocated for administrative costs (clerical, equipment)<br/>specific to the PAR program.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>*31.1.6 PAR Participation Date: The effective date for beginning in PAR is the date the<br/>JP assigns the CT to the PT. Teachers are limited to eighteen (18) months of<br/>participation in the Program.</p>

<p>Academic freedom shall be guaranteed to each unit member in the study, investigation,<br/>presentation, and interpretation of facts and ideas insofar as such facts and ideas reflect state<br/>and local prescribed courses of study.</p>
<p>Such academic freedom shall be subject to standards of professional responsibility with due<br/>regard for the maturity level of the students, laws of the State of California, and District<br/>policy, and administrative rules and regulations.</p>
<p>In performing instructional functions, a unit member shall have reasonable freedom to<br/>express personal opinions on all matters relevant to the course content, in an objective and<br/>judicious manner. A unit member, however, shall not utilize the instructional position to<br/>attempt to influence students with personal, political, and/or religious views. If views<br/>expressed are controversial issues, then sufficient information shall be made available on all<br/>sides of the issue so that alternatives can be discussed and evaluated on a reasonable basis.<br/>Board policies and administrative regulations regarding controversial issues shall be<br/>followed.</p>
<p>A unit member shall have the responsibility for determining grades for students in<br/>accordance with the standards for grading as established by District policy, and<br/>administrative rules and regulations.

<p>33.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit member must be employed, promoted, or retained without</p>
<p>discrimination or harassment respecting the unit member’s personal opinions or<br/>scholarly, literary, or artistic endeavors.</p>

<p>154</p>
<p>ARTICLE 34: SUPPLEMENTAL/REMEDIAL INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS<br/>(Summer and Extended Day Programs)</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree to offer supplemental/remedial academic instruction as long as the</p>

<p>Further, the provisions contained herein shall apply to all supplemental/remedial<br/>instructional programs regardless of when the program is offered, including, but not limited<br/>to, summer recess, before or after the regular school day, on Saturdays, during year-round<br/>school inter-sessions, and/or on any non-regular workday.</p>
<p>34.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of pay shall be the hourly rate specified in Appendix A.</p>
<p>34.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the class or program has been established, regardless of the number of<br/>students in a program, the unit member shall be paid for the hours spent<br/>teaching the program.</p>
<p>34.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An elementary extended school year (summer session/five (5) w<sup>7</sup>eek session)<br/>unit member shall receive pay for ten (10) hours of preparation time and two (2)<br/>hours of meeting time. A secondary extended school year (summer session/six</p>
<p>(6) week session) unit member shall receive pay for fifteen (15) hours of<br/>preparation time and two (2) hours of meeting time.</p>
<p>34.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member teaching in supplemental/remedial instructional programs shall have a class<br/>size limit that is as small as possible without exceeding the total funds authorized by the<br/>legislature. The District and the Association shall monitor the total funding and student<br/>enrollment to ensure compliance with this goal. The Association and the District shall meet<br/>no later than the fourth (4<sup>th</sup>) day of the extended school year (summer session) for the<br/>purpose of reviewing staffing and student enrollment.</p>
<p>34.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave: A unit member employed in a supplemental/remedial instructional program shall<br/>be provided sick leave as follows:</p>
<p>34.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In programs offered during summer session, a unit member shall be permitted to<br/>utilize up to four (4) hours paid sick leave for illness or immediate family illness.</p>
<p>34.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In supplemental programs other than summer session, a unit member who<br/>misses an hour(s) of instruction due to illness or immediate family illness may<br/>elect to make-up the missed hour(s) by rescheduling student services without<br/>loss of compensation.</p>
<p>34.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Posting of Assignments</p>

<p>34.5</p>
<p>34.6</p>
<p>34.7</p>
<p>34.8</p>
<p>notify the principal of their interest in the assignment within five (5) working<br/>days of receipt of the notice. The principal shall make special provision for<br/>notifying any unit member not at the site on the day of the announcement.</p>
<p>34.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principals shall be responsible for maintaining a list of teachers interested<br/>in teaching supplemental/remedial instructional programs at the site, and they<br/>shall maintain a list of teachers interested in teaching supplemental/remedial<br/>programs at other sites.</p>
<p>34.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of teachers interested in teaching at other sites will be sent to the<br/>Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources who will compile these lists<br/>and make them available to all principals no later than September 15 of each<br/>year. A copy of this list shall be sent to the Association. Unit members hired<br/>after September 15 will be provided the opportunity to indicate their interest in<br/>said positions upon their assignment to the school and shall have their names<br/>added to the lists.</p>
<p>34.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals must first use the candidates at the school site and then consult the<br/>District list in selecting the candidates.</p>
<p>Summer school principals shall choose the unit members to staff their schools from a list of<br/>unit members who certify to the Summer School Office (no later than March 1) that they<br/>desire to teach summer session. Once unit members have applied to teach summer session,<br/>the list shall be formulated by a random drawing of the applicants’ names. A new list shall be<br/>drawn each year.

The<br/>District shall not hire summer session employees from outside the District unless all<br/>interested and appropriately credentialed unit members are hired.</p>
<p>Summer School principals shall interview unit members qualified by training and/or<br/>experience in the order they appear on the list. If any unit member is passed over by three (3)<br/>principals, that unit member shall be dropped from the list and shall be given a written notice<br/>signed by the Director of Summer School as to why the unit member was not selected.</p>
<p>In order to afford opportunities for all interested unit members to teach during the summer<br/>session, no unit member may teach more than three (3) consecutive summer sessions unless<br/>no other unit member qualified by credential is on the list awaiting placement.</p>
<p>A unit member selected for an extended year summer session assignment shall be notified of<br/>the assignment by the end of the first full week in June. The first extended year staff meeting<br/>shall be conducted on the Monday of the final week of the regular school year, unless changed<br/>by mutual agreement between the District and the Association.</p>
<p>Extended school year unit members may be observed, but there is no formal<br/>observation/evaluation process for extended school year unit members. The unit member<br/>shall have the sole option of placement of any observation document in the Personnel File.</p>

<p>Individual Education Plans (IEPs)</p>
<p>36.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the IEP process for an individual child takes more than five (5) hours to<br/>complete, and, in other cases, if the site administrator and/or Director of Special<br/>Services determines that the cumulative IEP hours spent by the unit member are<br/>excessive, the unit member shall receive compensation as stated herein. The<br/>site administrator or Director of Special Services will meet with the unit<br/>member and make arrangements for compensation at the hourly rate,<br/>compensatory time off, and/or a mutually acceptable accommodation.</p>
<p>36.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member whose duties would be impacted by an IEP will be provided the<br/>opportunity to serve on the team responsible for developing, reviewing, and/or<br/>revising such program.</p>
<p>36.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make every effort to provide access to an IEP for an Individual<br/>with Exceptional Needs (IWEN) assigned to the class of any unit member at<br/>the time of placement of a student transferring within the District and at the<br/>time of placement of a student transferring from another District.</p>
<p>36.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that some special needs students may not meet or<br/>exceed the growth projected in the annual goals and objectives of the student’s<br/>IEP. In such instances, the District limits a unit member’s accountability to<br/>having implemented the services specified in the IEP. A unit member may<br/>request a review of an IEP according to Special Education Law and Regulations.</p>
<p>36.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A principal will reduce the Additional Required Time (40 hours) obligation of<br/>special day class teachers, resource specialists, speech and language<br/>pathologists, adaptive PE teachers, and other Special Education service<br/>providers by seven (7) hours for attendance at District-required Job-Alike<br/>meetings or workshops.</p>
<p>36.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IEP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meetings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the workday.</p>
<p>The case manager shall not be required to schedule an IEP meeting during that<br/>member’s preparation time. The site administrator may authorize the release of<br/>a unit member who attends the IEP meeting from instructional duties, if<br/>needed.</p>
