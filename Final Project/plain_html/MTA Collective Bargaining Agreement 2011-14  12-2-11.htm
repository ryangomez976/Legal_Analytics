<p>A. Paid Sick Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide for leave of absence from duty for the reasons<br/>and under the conditions described in this Article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid leave shall be credited annually and unused paid leave will accrue<br/>from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees shall be entitled to ten days leave with full pay for<br/>each school year for sick leave. Sick leave shall include personal illness,<br/>medical care, and personal necessity. Certificated part-time employees<br/>shall be entitled to that portion of the ten-day leave as is the ratio of their<br/>part-time employment to full-time employment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall, in accordance with the law and pursuant to the<br/>provisions of this contract, provide for an employee’s absence for<br/>personal necessity while charging such absence to sick leave.<br/>Personal necessity shall be defined as follows: A circumstance<br/>which requires unit member’s presence at a place other than the<br/>assigned place of duty. The circumstance must typically be<br/>unforeseen or beyond the control of the unit member and involve<br/>an occurrence or situation of such type that the unit member could<br/>not reasonably be expected to accommodate for it outside of<br/>assigned working hours.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board reserves the right to specify within the limits of statute<br/>and judicial precedent, the manner of proof of personal necessity,<br/>the type of situations in which such leave will be permitted and the<br/>total number of sick leave days which may be used in any school<br/>year for personal necessity leave.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days for personal necessity may not exceed<br/>seven.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teachers taking personal necessity leave on any one<br/>day shall not exceed the number of qualified (credentialed)<br/>substitute teachers available to fill the resultant vacant classes.<br/>Exceptions regarding “qualified” substitutes may be made at the<br/>discretion of the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum of two of the seven days for personal necessity may<br/>be used for bereavement on the death of a close friend.</p>

<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the employee’s<br/>immediate family.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving the employee’s person or property, or<br/>the person or property of a member of the employee’s<br/>immediate family.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven personal necessity leave days may be used for personal<br/>reasons that cannot reasonably be taken care of outside the hours<br/>of assigned duty or are obligatory in nature. The reason for<br/>absence for any of these seven days need not be stated; however<br/>the definition of “personal necessity” contained in A.4.a., above, is<br/>applicable to these days. The employee must provide to his/her<br/>supervisor as much advance notice of the intended absence as<br/>possible under the circumstances and must complete an Absence<br/>Request Form to secure a substitute and allow validation of the<br/>availability of personal necessity leave days. In addition to the<br/>restriction on use under the definition of “personal necessity”<br/>above, these days may not be used to create time off during an<br/>inservice immediately prior to the start of school instruction, to<br/>engage in concerted activities against the District, to engage in<br/>other employment, or to create time off during the final week of<br/>school.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional personal leave not otherwise covered by this Article<br/>may be granted by the Superintendent on an unpaid basis.</p>

<p>Labor Code Section 233 — Leave Of Absence</p>
<p>a. In any calendar year commencing 2000, an employee may use<br/>his/her accrued and available sick leave, up to an amount that<br/>would be accrued during six months’ employment at the<br/>employee’s then-current rate of entitlement, to attend to an illness<br/>of a child, parent, spouse, or domestic partner of the employee. All<br/>conditions and restrictions applicable to the use by an employee of<br/>sick leave shall apply to the use by the employee of sick leave to<br/>attend to an illness of his/her child, parent, spouse, or domestic<br/>partner.</p>
<p>The entitlement described herein does not extend the maximum period of<br/>leave to which an employee is entitled under Section 12945.2 of the<br/>Government Code regardless of whether the employee receives sick leave<br/>compensation during that leave.</p>
<p>As used in this section a:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Child” means a biological, foster, or adopted child, a<br/>stepchild, a legal ward, a child of a domestic partner, or a<br/>child of a person standing in loco parentis.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Parent” means a biological, foster, or adoptive parent, a<br/>stepparent, or a legal guardian.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sick leave” means accrued increments of compensated<br/>leave provided by the District to an employee as a benefit<br/>of the employment for use by the employee during an<br/>absence from the employment for any of the following</p>
<p>reasons:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee is physically or mentally unable to<br/>perform his/her duties due to illness, injury, or a<br/>medical condition of the employee.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence is for the purpose of obtaining<br/>professional diagnosis or treatment for a medical<br/>condition of the employee.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence is for other medical reasons of the<br/>employee, such as pregnancy or obtaining a<br/>physical examination.</p>
<p>b. “Sick leave” does not include any benefit provided under an<br/>employee welfare benefit plan subject to the federal Employee<br/>Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-406, as<br/>amended) and does not include any insurance benefit, workers’<br/>compensation benefit, unemployment compensation disability<br/>benefit, or benefit not payable from the District’s general assets.</p>
<p>[The provisions of this section A5 are added solely to implement the<br/>requirements of Labor Code §233 (added to law effective January 1, 2000)<br/>and shall remain in effect only as long as the law requires such additional<br/>leave of absence.]</p>
<p>Pregnancy Disability Leave</p>
<p>a. Employees are entitled to use sick leave for disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery</p>
<p>there from in the same terms and conditions governing leaves of<br/>absence for other illness or medical disability. Such leave shall be<br/>limited to those disabilities as set forth above. The length of such<br/>disability leave, including the date on which the leave commences,<br/>shall be determined by the employee and the employee’s<br/>physician; a written statement confirming these dates shall be<br/>signed by the employee’s physician and forwarded to the District<br/>Office.</p>
<p>Extended Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year, when a person employed in a position<br/>requiring certification qualifications has exhausted all available<br/>sick leave, including all accumulated sick leave, and continues to<br/>be absent from his/her duties on account of illness or accident for<br/>an additional period of five school months, whether or not the<br/>absence arises out of or in the course of the employment of the<br/>employee, the amount deducted from the salary due him/her for<br/>any of the additional five months in which the absence occurs shall<br/>not exceed the sum that is actually paid a substitute employee<br/>employed to fill his or her position during his/her absence or, if no<br/>substitute employee was employed, the amount that would have<br/>been paid to the substitute had he or she been employed. The<br/>District shall make every reasonable effort to secure the services of<br/>a substitute employee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of subdivision (a): (1) The sick leave, including<br/>accumulated sick leave, and the five-month period shall run<br/>consecutively. (2) An employee shall not be provided more than<br/>one five-month period per illness or accident. However, if a<br/>school year terminates before the five-month period is exhausted,<br/>the employee may take the balance of the five-month period in a<br/>subsequent school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall adopt a salary schedule for substitute employees<br/>which will indicate a salary for a substitute for all categories or<br/>classes of certificated employees of the District. If the District<br/>does not do so, the amount paid the substitute employee during any<br/>month shall be less than the salary due the employee absent from<br/>his/her duties.</p>
<p>When an employee has exhausted all available sick leave,<br/>including accumulated sick leave and continues to be absent on<br/>account of illness or accident for a period beyond the five-month<br/>period provided above, and the employee is not medically able to<br/>resume the duties of his/her position, the employee shall, if not<br/>placed in another position, be placed on a reemployment list for a</p>
<p>period of 24 months if the employee is on probationary status, or<br/>for a period of 39 months if the employee is on permanent status.<br/>When the employee is medically able, during the 24- or 39-month<br/>period, the employee shall be returned to employment in a position<br/>for which he/she is credentialed and qualified. The 24-month or</p>
<p>39-month period shall commence at the expiration of the five-<br/>month period provided above.</p>
<p>B. Paid Leave</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall be allowed leave of absence with full pay on<br/>account of death of any member of the employee’s immediate<br/>family.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to specify the manner of proof of<br/>bereavement leave.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate family” is defined to include husband, wife,<br/>mother, father, sister, brother, son, daughter, stepmother,<br/>stepfather, stepdaughter, stepson, grandparent, grandchild, mother-<br/>in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, stepchild,<br/>stepbrother, stepsister, son-in law, daughter-in-law or any relative<br/>of either spouse living in the immediate household of the<br/>employee. Other cases will be determined on an individual basis<br/>by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days of absence for bereavement purposes<br/>shall not exceed three days, or five days if travel out-of-state or<br/>200 miles one way to the funeral is necessary.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident or Illness Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit shall be allowed industrial<br/>accident and illness leave for up to 60 days during which the<br/>schools of the District are required to be in session, or when the<br/>employee would otherwise have been performing work for the<br/>District in any fiscal year for the same accident.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence the first day of<br/>absence. When a member of the bargaining unit is absent from<br/>his/her duties on account of an industrial accident or illness, he/she<br/>shall be paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any month<br/>in which the absence occurs as, when added to his/her temporary<br/>disability indemnity under Division 4 or 4.5 of the Labor Code,</p>
<p>will result in payment to him/her of no more than his/her full<br/>salary.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase “full salary” as utilized herein shall be computed so<br/>that it shall not be less than employee’s “average weekly earnings”<br/>as that phrase is utilized in section 4453 of the Labor Code. For<br/>purposes of this section, however, the maximum and minimum<br/>average weekly earnings set forth in section 4453 of the Labor<br/>Code shall otherwise not be deemed applicable.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one day for<br/>each day of authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability<br/>indemnity award.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next<br/>fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only the amount of<br/>unused leave due him/her for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the<br/>employee shall be entitled to the benefits provided in sections<br/>44977, 44978 and 44983 of the California Education Code, and for<br/>the purposes of each of these sections, his/her absence shall be<br/>deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the<br/>industrial accident or illness leave, provided that if the employee<br/>continues to receive temporary disability indemnity, he/she may<br/>elect to take as much of his/her accumulated sick leave which,<br/>when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity, will result in<br/>a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the employee shall endorse to<br/>the District the temporary disability and indemnity checks received<br/>on account of his/her industrial accident or illness. The District, in<br/>turn, shall issue the employee appropriate salary warrants for<br/>payment of the employee’s salary and shall deduct normal<br/>retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee receiving benefits as the result of this section shall,<br/>during periods of illness or injury, remain within the State of<br/>California unless the governing board authorizes travel outside the<br/>State.</p>
<p>3. Jury Duty Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave for jury duty shall be granted with full pay if the following</p>
<p>condition is met: the employee endorses over to the District all<br/>fees, except travel reimbursement, received by the employee for<br/>jury services.</p>
<p>b.</p>
<p>Upon notification of jury or grand jury duty, it is the obligation of<br/>the employee to immediately inform the principal to make a<br/>request for leave of absence through the District.</p>
<p>C. Unpaid Leave</p>
<p>1. Childbearing Preparation and Childrearing</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the employee’s request, leave without pay shall be granted for</p>
<p>preparation for childrearing and for childbearing subject to the</p>
<p>following conditions:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall request such leave as soon as<br/>practicable. Except in case of adoption, notice shall be<br/>given no less than 30 working days prior to the date on<br/>which the leave is to begin. Such request shall be in<br/>writing and shall include a statement as to the date the<br/>employee wishes to begin and end the leave.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination as to the day on which the leave is to<br/>begin and the duration of such leave shall be made at the<br/>discretion of the Superintendent on leaves of 30 days or<br/>less, and by the Board of Trustees on any leaves exceeding<br/>30 days when considering the scheduling and replacement<br/>problems of the District.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of childrearing leave shall be for a period of<br/>up to one year, except that the District retains the option to<br/>delay the employees return until the end of the semester to<br/>provide for educational continuity.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on childbearing or childrearing leave may<br/>continue in the District group health, dental, and vision<br/>plan by paying the premiums during the period of leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Consideration</p>
<p>1) Upon recommendation of the Superintendent and approval<br/>by the Board, leave may be granted for one school year to a<br/>bargaining unit employee subject to whatever conditions<br/>are mutually agreeable between the parties.</p>

It is acknowledged that this funding has<br/>been folded into the staff development block grant. The increase in work days<br/>and inclusion/reflection of the days on the salary schedule will commence on July<br/>1, 2008. Attendance and salary compensation is mandatory and can only be<br/>excused by a Medical Doctor’s excuse or prior authorization of the<br/>superintendent.

<p>ARTICLE VII<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions of Grievance Procedure Terminology</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is an allegation by a grievant of violation of a term or terms<br/>of this Agreement that adversely affects the grievant.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is one or more employees in the bargaining unit or the<br/>Association filing a grievance.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “party of interest” is any person who might be required to take action or<br/>against whom action might be taken to resolve this claim.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “day” is any day on which the District office is open for business.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may from<br/>time to time arise affecting the welfare or working conditions of<br/>employees as defined in A “1”, above. Grievance proceedings will be<br/>kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>employee having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with an<br/>appropriate member of the administration.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible,<br/>the time limits specified at each level should be considered to be<br/>maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The<br/>time limits, however, may be extended by mutual agreement. Failure of<br/>the grievant to file a grievance within the specified time limit or to process<br/>the grievance within the time limit at each step shall be deemed a waiver<br/>of the right to utilize this grievance procedure, and no further action shall<br/>be taken. Failure of the administration to comply with a time limit shall<br/>allow the grievant to immediately take the grievance to the next level.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the levels in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>term, the time limit set forth herein may be reduced so that the grievance<br/>procedure may be completed prior to the end of the school term or as soon<br/>thereafter as practicable.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. Level 1 - Informal</p>

<p>Only errors in the Program’s procedure (as contrasted with allegations of error in<br/>subjective judgment or opinions or ratings of quality of performance) are subject<br/>to the grievance procedure contained in the Master Agreement between the<br/>Association and the District. As to authorized grievances. Level 4 of the<br/>grievance procedure shall be as follows:</p>
<p>Arbitration</p>
<p>Grievances which are not settled at Step 3, and which the Association<br/>desires to contest further, shall be submitted to arbitration as provided<br/>herein, but only if the Association gives written notice to the<br/>Superintendent of its desire to arbitrate the Grievance within ten work<br/>days after the termination of Step 3 of the grievance procedure. It is<br/>expressly understood that the only matters which are subject to arbitration<br/>under this Article are grievances which were processed and handled in<br/>accordance with the grievance procedure in the negotiated Agreement<br/>between the District and the Association and which are not excluded from<br/>arbitration by other provisions of the Agreement.</p>
<p>1. Selection of Arbitrator</p>
<p>As soon as possible after the District receives written notice of the<br/>Association’s desire to arbitrate, the parties shall agree upon an arbitrator.<br/>If no agreement is otherwise reached, an arbitrator shall be selected from a<br/>list of five arbitrators provided by the State Mediation and Conciliation<br/>Service or the American Arbitration Association by alternate striking of<br/>names until one name remains. Before any name-striking occurs, either<br/>party may elect to request a second list. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1 ZL_1 S</p>
<p>The party who strikes the first name shall be determined by lot. The<br/>arbitrator shall be selected within ten calendar days after the District<br/>receives the list of arbitrators from the State. If the arbitrator selected<br/>indicates that he/she will not be available for hearing within a reasonable<br/>time not exceeding 60 days, the parties shall proceed to select another<br/>arbitrator from the above list or from a second list which may be requested<br/>by the District or the Association.</p>
<p>2. Arbitration Standards</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend, change, add to, or<br/>subtract from any of the terms of the PAR Program, but shall determine<br/>only whether or not there has been a violation of the Program as<br/>complained of by the grievant. The decision of the arbitrator shall be<br/>based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented to him/her by the<br/>respective parties in the presence of each other, and upon post-hearing<br/>briefs of the parties.</p>
<p>The Peer Assistance and Review Program constitutes a contract between<br/>the parties which shall be interpreted and applied by the parties and by the<br/>arbitrator in the same manner as any other contract under the laws of the<br/>State of California. The function and purpose of the arbitrator is to<br/>determine disputed interpretation of terms actually found in the Program,<br/>or to determine disputed facts upon which the application of the Program<br/>depends. The arbitrator shall therefore not have authority, nor shall he/she<br/>consider it his/her function to decide any issue not jointly submitted or to<br/>so interpret or apply the Program’s terms as to change what can fairly be<br/>said to have been the intent of the parties as determined by generally<br/>accepted rules of contract construction. Past practice of the parties in<br/>interpreting or applying terms of the Program may be relevant evidence,<br/>but shall not be used so as to justify, or result in, what is in effect a<br/>modification (whether by addition or detraction) of the written terms of<br/>the Program. The arbitrator shall not render any decision or award, or fail<br/>to render any decision or award merely because, in his/her opinion, such<br/>decision or award is fair or equitable.</p>
<p>If a grievance is not processed by the grievant and Association in<br/>accordance with the time limit set forth in this article, it shall not be<br/>subject to arbitration and shall be considered settled on the basis of the<br/>decision last made by the District. If the District fails to respond to the<br/>grievance in a timely manner at any step, the grievant may proceed to the<br/>next step of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>Processing and discussing the merits of an asserted grievance shall not<br/>constitute a waiver by the District of a defense that the dispute is not<br/>grievable. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>1 zL-1</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Motions to Dismiss</p>
<p>If the District claims that a grievance should be dismissed because, for<br/>example, it falls outside the scope of the procedure, or was filed or<br/>processed in an untimely manner, such a claim shall, at the option of the<br/>District and upon reasonable notice to the Association, be heard and ruled<br/>upon by the arbitrator prior to any hearing on the merits of the grievance.<br/>Upon the request of either party, there shall be a suitable stay/continuance<br/>between such a ruling and any further proceedings which may be<br/>necessary. The District may forego the above preliminary motion<br/>procedure and have such a claim heard and ruled upon at the hearing prior<br/>to the receipt of evidence on the merits. If the District should choose to<br/>refuse to arbitrate a dispute, nothing in this Section shall preclude the<br/>Association from seeking, through appropriate administrative or judicial<br/>proceedings, to compel the District to proceed to arbitration.</p>
<p>4. Arbitrator’s Decision</p>
<p>The decision of the arbitrator within the limits herein prescribed shall be<br/>binding upon the District, the Association, and the grievant.</p>
<p>All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the<br/>District and the Association. Each party shall bear the expense of the<br/>presentation of its own case. <sup>1</sup></p>

If no agreement is otherwise reached, an arbitrator shall be selected<br/>from a list of five arbitrators provided by the State Mediation and Conciliation<br/>Service by alternate striking of names until one name remains. Before any name-<br/>striking occurs, either party may elect to request a second list.</p>
<p>The party who strikes the first name shall be determined by lot. The arbitrator<br/>shall be selected within ten calendar days after the District receives the list of<br/>arbitrators from the State. If the arbitrator selected indicates that he/she will not<br/>be available for hearing within a reasonable time not exceeding sixty days, the<br/>parties shall proceed to select another arbitrator from the above list or from a<br/>second list which may be requested by the District or the Association.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration Standards: The arbitrator shall have no power to alter, amend,<br/>change, add to, or subtract from any of the terms of this agreement. All aspects of<br/>the appropriateness of the suspension without pay imposed shall be within the<br/>exclusi ve jurisdiction of the arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be<br/>based solely upon the evidence and arguments presented to him/her by the</p>
<p>respective parties in the presence of each other, and upon post-hearing briefs of<br/>the parties.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motions to Dismiss: If the District claims that an appeal should be dismissed<br/>because it was filed in an untimely manner, such a claim shall, at the option of the<br/>District and upon reasonable notice to the Association, be heard and ruled upon<br/>by the arbitrator prior to any hearing on the merits of the appeal. Upon the<br/>request of either party, there shall be a suitable stay/continuance between such a<br/>ruling and any further proceedings which may be necessary. The District may<br/>forego the above preliminary motion procedure and have such a claim heard and<br/>ruled upon at the hearing prior to the receipt of evidence on the merits.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitrator’s Decision: The decision of the arbitrator, within the limits herein<br/>prescribed, shall be binding upon the District, the Association, and the employee-<br/>appellant.</p>
<p>All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne by the District. Each party<br/>shall bear the expense of the presentation of its own case. <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>ARTICLE XIX<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>1. The Board and Association understand the complexity and difficulties in<br/>scheduling classes. Reasonable class sizes are essential to good education.<br/>Therefore, the district will keep class size within the limits and constraints<br/>imposed by classroom and materials considering thirty students as an ideal<br/>maximum.</p>
<p>2. The District shall make every effort to equally distribute and shall make every<br/>effort not to exceed the following desired class maximum:</p>
<p>a.</p>
<p>Elementary</p>
<p>K</p>
<p>1-3</p>
<p>4-5</p>
<p>6-8</p>
<p>Combination</p>
<p>9-12</p>
<p>Class Size<br/>20<br/>20</p>
<p>30 average class size</p>
<p>36 average class size</p>
<p>28 individual class size</p>
<p>30 Average class size (Individual Disciplines)</p>
<p>3. If a class size exceeds the desired class maximum, the following options will be<br/>considered:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District paid instructional assistant will be hired to work in the affected<br/>class.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional teacher will be hired to alleviate the overcrowded class.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stipend will be granted to the teacher in the overcrowded class.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A combination class will be created.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision will be reached and one or more option(s) may be exercise after<br/>discussion among the teacher, principal, and the superintendent.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aides may be assigned by the principal or superintendent in smaller classes as<br/>needed due to students with special needs.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize that it may be necessary from time to<br/>time, to form classes compromised of students of different grade levels. These<br/>combined classes, while occasionally necessary, should be scheduled only when<br/>no other suitable alternative exists.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board and Association realize that there are facility and equipment<br/>limitations in some instructional areas that require special consideration.<br/>Currently the following facilities have teacher/1 earning situations for a specific<br/>number of students which shall be used as guidelines for assisting students:</p>
