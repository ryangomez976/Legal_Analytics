<p>PREAMBLE</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Napa Valley Educators' Association (NVEA) and the Napa Valley<br/>Unified School District (NVUSD) to endorse, commit to, and continually use an interest-<br/>based problem solving approach to collective bargaining. We agree with the basic tenets of<br/>interest-based problem solving, which are to:</p>
<p>• Separate people from the problem;</p>
<p>• Focus on interests, not positions;</p>
<p>• Develop options for mutual gains; and<br/>• Use objective criteria, where possible.</p>
<p>The NVEA/NVUSD Council, typically consisting of teachers, administrators and board<br/>members, will work with a consensus model that states: &quot;Everyone in the group supports,<br/>agrees to, or can live with a particular decision. In the end, everyone can say: 'I believe you<br/>understand my point of view. I believe I understand your point of view. Whether or not I<br/>prefer this decision above all others, I will support it because it was reached fairly and<br/>openly.'&quot; As a means to this end, we have developed the following guiding principles and<br/>operational procedures which apply to all Council meetings and Council Committee<br/>meetings in which District and Association business is transacted. It is assumed that any<br/>new participants in the process will receive some orientation and training to enable them to<br/>effectively participate within these guidelines. We also support the use of interest-based<br/>problem solving strategies as a tool for solving problems at the school site level.</p>
<p>A. Guiding Principles</p>
<p>Time will be taken at the beginning of any meeting for introductions if there are parties who<br/>don't know one another, and to familiarize new participants with these guidelines.</p>
<p>Interest-based problem solving approaches will be utilized at all times.</p>
<p>Meetings will be maintained as a safe place in which to discuss issues; varying points of<br/>view will be welcomed and honored.</p>
<p>It is an expectation that participants will formally and informally check assumptions to ensure<br/>that communications are thorough and effective.</p>
<p>A variety of topics are open to discussion in Council meetings, and it is the intent of all<br/>participants to thoroughly discuss and clarify the issues.</p>
<p>All participants will assist the facilitator by assuming responsibility to keep the process<br/>moving, and to ensure that ground rules are respected.</p>
<p>Participants will focus on the problem, not on the person, and there will be no personal<br/>attacks.</p>
<p>Only one person will speak at a time.</p>
<p>The District/Association Council process is dependent upon &quot;working smart.&quot; This involves<br/>clearly defining the issues and finding the most efficient way of transacting business.</p>
<p>It is assumed that all participants, while looking after their unique interests, will also make an<br/>effort to keep a global view on all problems.</p>
<p>When possible, seating will be organized in a horseshoe configuration with flip charts and<br/>notes posted at the open end of the horseshoe.</p>
<p>Participants will take care, when appropriate, to seat themselves in meetings randomly<br/>rather than in district and association groups.</p>
<p>Caucuses will be kept to a minimum. Generally if either the district or association needs to<br/>confer in its own group, the meeting will be recessed to another date to ensure the most<br/>efficient use of time. When caucuses take place during meetings they will last no longer<br/>than ten minutes. Whenever possible, the reasons for the caucus and the outcome will be<br/>shared upon its conclusion.</p>
<p>B. Operational Procedures</p>
<p>Facilitators and recorders will be appointed in all meetings. Responsibility for facilitating<br/>Council meetings will generally rotate between District and Association participants.</p>
<p>The agenda will be set at the beginning of each meeting, and the meeting will follow that<br/>agenda.</p>
<p>More difficult items will be referred to a subcommittee for problem solving and a<br/>recommendation back to the Council. (Check with the group to see if the topic is exhausted)</p>
<p>It will be one of the functions of the Council to organize the makeup of subcommittees.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each school year the Council will meet to identify the outstanding issues<br/>and to generate the agenda for the coming year.</p>

The unit member requesting a<br/>salary advancement must submit all relevant degrees and transcripts for<br/>examination and approval by the Department of Human Resources. All<br/>units and degrees shall only be approved by the District when they have<br/>been achieved at an accredited college or university.</p>
<p>4.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Board Certification Stipend</p>
<p>Beginning school year 2000-2001, a stipend for “National Board<br/>Certification” was added to the salary schedule. The stipend will be<br/>comparable to the Doctorate degree, and will be paid for out of the NVEA<br/>side of the FORMULA.</p>

<p>been under contract in paid status to the District at least seventy-five (75) percent</p>
<p>(136.8 days) of the school year (182.5) days.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplemental Assignment</p>
<p>4.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may offer additional hours of teaching to unit members<br/>already teaching a full contract day. If unit members accept teaching<br/>assignments beyond a full contract (1.0 FTE), they shall be compensated<br/>based on five (5) additional periods per week or a prorated amount<br/>thereof. A teaching period for the purposes of this contract is defined as<br/>approximately fifty-five (55) minutes of teaching time. Unit members shall<br/>be entitled to State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) benefits as<br/>allowed by STRS.</p>
<p>4.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick Leave</p>
<p>4.5.2.1 Unit members with a supplemental assignment shall earn<br/>special sick leave at the rate of one (1) hour of leave per<br/>month or a prorated amount thereof.

<p>4.6 When middle school team leader stipends are given, the costs of all team leaders<br/>will be charged to the NVEA side of the FORMULA. The formula for the number of<br/>team leader stipends is: total enrollment [including Special Education] 150 =<br/>stipends + 1 additional stipend.</p>
<p>4.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula for the number of team leader stipends is the total enrollment<br/>(including special education students) divided by 150. The result will<br/>establish the number of team leader stipends to be allocated for<br/>academic teams. Add to this result one additional stipend to account for<br/>Physical Education (PE) because, PE has been asked to perform<br/>leadership functions without compensation. Therefore, the formula for<br/>determining the number of team leader stipends at each middle school<br/>should be expanded by this one additional stipend.</p>
<p>4.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of all team leaders will be charged to the NVEA side of the<br/>FORMULA.</p>
<p>4.7 Employer Employee Relations (EER) Training Program</p>
<p>4.7.1 It is the intent of this program to promote an effective problem-solving<br/>relationship between principals and site representatives at each school as<br/>well as to recognize and encourage service in NVEA roles. It is expected<br/>that participating site representatives will meet and work on a regular<br/>basis with the school principal for the purposes of communications and<br/>problem solving.</p>
<p>The normal District/Association communication mechanisms assumes<br/>that issues affecting specific individuals at school sites will be considered<br/>first through the site representative/principal communications process<br/>before being considered at the NVEA/NVUSD Council level. Unit<br/>members at school sites are encouraged to select a representative willing<br/>to meet and work with the principal at that site to address problems which<br/>occur at the site. Training will be offered on a regular basis to ensure that</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>principals and site representatives have a common vocabulary and<br/>methodology for addressing issues which arise.</p>
<p>4.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each individual filling one of the following roles will participate in the<br/>Employer Employee Relations (EER) training. The Association, in<br/>partnership with EER staff, will identify the number of positions eligible by<br/>site/department annually:</p>
<p>4.7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site and itinerant teacher representatives;</p>
<p>4.7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen (15) NVEA Executive Board members; and</p>
<p>4.7.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Negotiations Team.</p>
<p>4.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association may increase the number of site representatives to be<br/>included in this program and paid for by FORMULA training/retraining<br/>dollars, according to the by-laws, by sending an official memo to the<br/>Employer-Employee Relations Office.</p>
<p>4.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible members will receive one (1) day of released time to be used for<br/>Employer Employee Relations (EER) training as identified by the<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources in partnership with the<br/>NVEA President. When substitutes are available, one day of release time<br/>must be allocated for Employer Employee Relations (EER) training the<br/>first year that the member participates in the program (or the first time<br/>thereafter that the training is offered) or, when a site team changes.</p>
<p>4.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will be reviewed at each contract renewal.</p>
<p>4.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding will be allocated from FORMULA training/retraining dollars. (See<br/>Article 22.1) The program accounting will be maintained by the EER<br/>Office.</p>
<p>4.8 Role Recognition and Incentive Program</p>
<p>4.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each individual filling one of the following rolls will be eligible for the<br/>recognition and receive a stipend. Those serving in more than one role<br/>will qualify for recognition.</p>
<p>4.8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site and itinerant teacher representatives; and</p>
<p>4.8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen (15) Executive Board members excluding the positions<br/>which already receive release periods (currently the President<br/>and Bargaining Chair), unless they take on another leadership<br/>role.</p>
<p>4.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incentives will consist of a stipend in the amount of $400.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>4.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval of payment of the cash stipend will be subject to the verification<br/>by the Association that the Association role is being fulfilled. Stipends will<br/>be included on the June 30<sup>th</sup> pay warrant.</p>
<p>4.8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding will be allocated from FORMULA a training/retraining dollars.</p>
<p>4.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program accounting will be maintained in the EER office.</p>
<p>4.8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will be reviewed at each contract renewal.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5: HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide health insurance for unit members and their dependents.<br/>The District’s contribution through the NVEA side of the FORMULA to a health<br/>plan shall not exceed $346.88, per month per member. It is understood and<br/>agreed that participating unit members will pay the difference, if any, between the<br/>$346.88 per month and the actual insurance premium. The District through the<br/>NVEA side of the FORMULA will also provide Delta Dental insurance for all unit<br/>members and their dependents with $1,500.00 benefit cap including<br/>prosthodontics at the 50% co-insurance.</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members working less than full time shall receive the appropriate pro<br/>ration of the $346.88 per month amount. The sum of the total amount<br/>computed shall be applied first against the District dental insurance and<br/>any balance remaining towards District medical insurance.</p>

The allocation of prep time may vary<br/>when a site has a school based exception to the CBA. (See Article 17)</p>
<p>7.1.5.1 Every classroom teacher grades 1-5 shall receive one forty<br/>(40) minute preparation period per week, scheduled during the<br/>time in which students are in attendance at their elementary<br/>school. This preparation period is in addition to the regularly<br/>scheduled daily preparation period which is scheduled when<br/>students are not in attendance at that elementary school.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Based on the current funding mechanism Special Education<br/>teachers do not receive this forty (40) minute preparation<br/>period. (It is the intent that the parties will jointly investigate<br/>providing special &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;education&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teachers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with equitable</p>
<p>preparation time.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for these&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-5 elementary</p>

<p>7.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The components of the on-site professional day shall not exceed seven<br/>(7) hours unless otherwise requested by the unit members and approved<br/>by the site administrator. (Exception for faculty meetings addressed in<br/>Article 7.7) Modifications of the professional day schedule, if necessary,<br/>will be done by the site administrator and school staff using Article 17.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are also required to undertake a maximum of six (6) additional extra¬<br/>duty assignments which will include Back-to-School and/or Open House activities<br/>during the school contract year.</p>
<p>7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These assignments may require that the member remain or return after<br/>the close of the on-site workday; e.g. supervision of social, service,<br/>athletic activities; traffic patrol; District committees; or other non¬<br/>classroom assignments as determined by the site administrator/<br/>designee. Unit members assigned to more than one (1) site will be<br/>assigned no more than a total of two (2) additional duty assignments<br/>beyond Open House and Back to School.</p>
<p>7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These assignments will be allocated according to the need at the<br/>particular site. Consideration will be given to assignments at other<br/>schools of comparable grade levels and/or size.</p>
<p>7.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These assignments will be made equitably and impartially by the site<br/>administrator with staff consultation and will be determined and published<br/>within the first twenty (20) work days. Management reserves the right to<br/>make adjustments or changes with reasonable notice. Employee needs<br/>for changes to these assignments will be made by mutual agreement with<br/>the site administrator. No change will be made within forty-eight (48)<br/>hours, except in an emergency, without mutual agreement between the<br/>unit member and site administrator/designee.</p>
<p>7.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These assignments will not be made on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays,<br/>except by mutual agreement between the site administrator and the<br/>individual unit member involved.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to assigned screening committees, nurses shall be required to<br/>undertake two (2) additional assignments as set forth in Section 7.2.</p>

<p>18</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource Specialists shall not normally be assigned to substitute in a regular class<br/>or to perform administrative duties except in an emergency. This is not to be<br/>construed as prohibiting a Resource Specialist from working with classroom<br/>teachers.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an emergency, the site administrator/designee has the right to assign unit<br/>members as needed.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administratively called faculty meetings called for outside the regular on-site<br/>workday shall be limited to two (2) regular meetings per month. Emergency faculty<br/>meetings may be called by the site administrator/designee should an important<br/>need arise. All faculty meetings shall normally close by 4:15 p.m.; should such a<br/>meeting extend beyond 4:15 p.m., unit members have the option of remaining.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early Release Planning Time: The purpose of early release planning time is to<br/>provide opportunities for staff members to collaborate on instructional issues<br/>focused on student learning. The Association and District have stipulated that at<br/>K12 the manner in which planning time is organized and used should be determined<br/>collaboratively by teachers and administrators at each site.</p>
<p>7.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways in which the decisions regarding scheduling<br/>content of Early Release Wednesdays may be made. The entire staff can<br/>work together to reach consensus on a plan, or the staff can delegate the<br/>development of a straw design to a leadership team and the principal. For<br/>example, staff might meet to identify interests related to the use of this time,<br/>and then ask the leadership team or another subcommittee to develop a<br/>straw design to bring back for review, input, and eventually a decision.</p>
<p>7.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Practices for the use and organization of Early Release time include:</p>
<p>... Development of an Early Release calendar and schedule with<br/>consideration of district professional development opportunities;</p>
<p>... Activities tied to grade, content team, and school or District goals;</p>
<p>... On or off site professional development opportunities;</p>
<p>... Emergency mandated compliance based trainings shall be considered<br/>and scheduled to no less than two (2) weeks before and will be<br/>communicated through the site principal first.</p>
<p>If members of the staff are dissatisfied with how this time is currently used,<br/>then it is the responsibility of dissenting staff members to share their<br/>concerns with site leadership team and the principal. Members who still have<br/>concerns can discuss those concerns with the Association site representative</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>and request that discussions be held as soon as possible to resolve any<br/>concerns.</p>
<p>7.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appropriate for staff members to use Early Release time to determine an<br/>appropriate plan if questions are raised about the planned use of the Early<br/>Release time. In such cases, the principal, leadership team, and site<br/>representatives will determine how to proceed.</p>
<p>7.8.4 Each site will submit at the end of each year an Early Release Wednesday<br/>schedule; keeping in mind best practice, with an explanation of the process<br/>that was used to set the schedule for the upcoming school year. At the<br/>Elementary level, this may require reorganizing the instruction week for<br/>individual teachers to accommodate an hour of Early Release time.</p>

<p>9.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To resolve conflicts that may or may not affect the educational<br/>program.</p>
<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a formal request for an administratively initiated transfer is acted<br/>upon, the unit member shall be advised in writing and through a personal<br/>interview by the administrator requesting the transfer of the reasons for<br/>the transfer. A copy of the written notification shall be forwarded to the<br/>Department of Human Resources.</p>

Volunteers will be sought through<br/>departmental or school-site meetings and bulletin board postings. When<br/>no volunteer(s) is/are forthcoming, the administrator using Section 9.4.5<br/>will determine the unit member(s) qualified to fill an existing opening(s).<br/>Should the site administrator identify more than one unit member qualified<br/>for an existing opening, the least senior shall be transferred. The unit<br/>member(s) being transferred shall be consulted with and informed in<br/>writing prior to the transfer.</p>

<p>9.4.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all else is equal in items 9.4.5.1 through 9.4.5.3, District<br/>seniority will resolve the selection. This language shall not be<br/>used for administratively initiated transferee(s) who can qualify<br/>for only one (1) of the available opening(s).</p>
<p>9.4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any unit member has been administratively transferred from a<br/>given position, except for Section 9.4.1.3 above, that member shall retain<br/>preference for return to that or equivalent position for which the member<br/>is qualified, provided he/she has requested such return in writing and<br/>provided any position becomes open. The right to return will remain in<br/>place for two (2) years, and, may be renewed for an additional two (2)<br/>years by written request of the unit member.

<p>9.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific program skills (example: team experience, reading<br/>resources, computer math, library training, media skills, etc.)</p>
<p>9.5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all else is equal in Sections 9.5.1.1 and 9.5.1.2, District<br/>seniority will resolve the selection.</p>

The<br/>following scale will be used to determine the number of available DPNL<br/>days:</p>
<p>... One (1) to thirty (30) days accumulated sick leave = three (3)<br/>DPNL days</p>
<p>... Thirty-one (31) to sixty (60) days accumulated sick leave =<br/>four (4) DPNL days<br/>... Sixty-one (61) to one hundred (100) days accumulated sick<br/>leave = five (5) DPNL days<br/>... One hundred-one (101) or more days accumulated sick leave<br/>= seven (7) DPNL days.</p>

<p>11.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On or before the third Friday of December, Conference 2 for unit members<br/>in non-permanent status will be completed. The Conference Form 2 will be<br/>completed with permanent employees when an Area of Concern or “Not<br/>Effective/Does Not Meet Standards” is identified on or before the first Friday<br/>in March by the evaluator. In written form the evaluatee will bring to<br/>Conference 2, his/her interim self-evaluation and discuss with the prime<br/>evaluator/designee the progress he/she is making toward the agreed upon<br/>goals/objectives. Upon completion of Conference 2, a copy of the<br/>Authorized Evaluation Form will be forwarded by the evaluator to the<br/>Department of Human Resources.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>11.4.6 Approximately sixty (60) days and no less than thirty (30) days prior to the</p>
<p>end of the school work year, Conference 3 is to be completed and</p>
<p>Conference Form 3 shall be forwarded to the Department of Human</p>
<p>Resources. The procedure for the evaluation of unit members will include:</p>
<p>11.4.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime evaluator/designee must be provided with the results<br/>of the agreed upon sources of evaluative data at least one (1)<br/>week prior to the conference. This material must be shown to<br/>the evaluatee either prior to or during Conference 3.</p>
<p>11.4.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In written form, the evaluatee will bring to Conference 3 his/her<br/>self-evaluation based on the agreed upon evaluation process.</p>
<p>11.4.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In working draft form, the prime evaluator/designee shall state<br/>his/her opinion as to whether the goals/objectives agreed upon<br/>are in the process of being, or have been, met and shall provide<br/>qualifying statements with direct references to the evaluation<br/>method used.</p>
<p>11.4.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime evaluator/designee and evaluatee will exchange<br/>written informal evaluations and discuss areas of agreement or<br/>disagreement.</p>
<p>11.4.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall meet annually to determine the availability of</p>
<p>adequate funding to support Peer Assistance and Review. In<br/>the event that the PAR program (Article 12) receives dedicated<br/>funding the following two elements shall be implemented. In the<br/>absence of such dedicated funding, any appropriate support<br/>elements identified in Article 12 will be implemented.</p>
<p>11.4.6.5.1 In the years that the PARS program is<br/>implemented, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any permanent certificated</p>
<p>employee who receives an “not effective/does not<br/>meet standards” rating in the current year<br/>Stull/CSTP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation process shall be</p>
<p>referred to the Joint Committee and shall be<br/>recommended for participation in the PAR<br/>program the following year. (See also 12.2.2).</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>11.4.6.5.2 If a permanent certificated employee participates<br/>in PAR as the result of “not effective/does not<br/>meet standards” performance, the results of that<br/>participation will become part of the employee's<br/>current or next evaluation, conducted by the<br/>designated &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAR</p>
<p>participation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be placed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher’s</p>
<p>personnel file. (See also 12.2.3).</p>
<p>11.4.6.6 The prime evaluator/designee will complete Conference Form<br/>3 and give the evaluatee an opportunity to make written<br/>comments or to state a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written disagreement with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prime</p>
<p>evaluator/designee's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prime</p>
<p>evaluator/designee and the evaluatee will meet together to<br/>sign Conference Form 3. The evaluatee's signature does not<br/>indicate the evaluatee's agreement with the written evaluation,<br/>but indicates that s/he has read the report and understands<br/>that s/he will have the opportunity to respond in writing. If the<br/>evaluatee submits a written response, it shall become a<br/>permanent part of all copies of the evaluation report.</p>
<p>11.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All evaluations of performance shall be done within the context of the<br/>instructional program(s) and the adjunct assignment(s) for which the<br/>evaluatee is responsible. Any material included in the evaluation shall be<br/>verified first-hand by the designated evaluator(s).</p>
<p>11.4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the evaluation process to validate competency in each of<br/>the six areas of the California Standards for the Teaching Profession as<br/>specified on the evaluation forms.</p>
<p>11.4.8.1 If an &quot;area of concern&quot; or “not effective/does not meet<br/>standards” is checked on either Conference Form 2 or<br/>Conference Form 3, a professional growth plan addressing<br/>those areas of concern, shall be mutually developed by the<br/>evaluator and evaluatee. Specific goals related to the perceived<br/>deficiencies in the given CSTP competencies will be included in<br/>the next scheduled evaluation. This does not preclude<br/>additional professional growth goals being identified by mutual<br/>agreement. EC 44664</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>11.4.8.2 New teachers or teachers who are unknown to their evaluators<br/>will have goals related to the demonstration of proficiency in<br/>each of the six areas of the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>11.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following conditions (any one or all) occurring after goals and<br/>objectives have been set shall be sufficient cause to allow the unit member<br/>to request the amendment or deletion of evaluation goals and objectives set<br/>by the unit member during the year as a part of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>11.4.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterations of the classroom or school physical conditions, which<br/>have an adverse effect on learning;</p>
<p>11.4.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alterations to school or class schedules which cause continual<br/>disruption;</p>
<p>11.4.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficient educational materials; and</p>
<p>11.4.9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insufficient support service.</p>
<p>11.4.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless specified in the employee's goals/objectives (see item 11.4.4 above)<br/>a unit member assigned a student of exceptional need shall have no<br/>greater responsibility for such student than any other student in the class;<br/>nor will the unit member be evaluated on whether or not an individual with<br/>exceptional needs meets the growth projected in the IEP.</p>
<p>11.4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will be held responsible for good faith participation in the<br/>IEP process.</p>
<p>11.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation shall include data obtained from unscheduled and<br/>scheduled observation/s. Unscheduled observations shall not exceed two</p>
<p>(2) such observations for each scheduled observation. A minimum of two</p>
<p>(2) days notice shall be given prior to scheduled observations. The<br/>minimum number and type(s) of observations shall be agreed upon during<br/>the initial conference. Each evaluation shall include information relevant to<br/>at least one scheduled observation of a full lesson presentation. Each<br/>observation from which data is gathered for inclusion in the final evaluation<br/>shall be followed by a conference within five (5) days to discuss the<br/>observation and for the parties to sign off on a written summary of the<br/>observation. Summary comments may be added by the evaluatee within<br/>three (3) working days of the post observation conference.</p>
<p>11.4.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be required to participate in the evaluation and/or<br/>observation of other unit members.</p>
<p>11.4.14 As per Articles 11.4.6.5.1 and 11.4.6.5.2, a unit member who receives an<br/>Area of Concern or Not Effective/Does Not Meet Standards rating on<br/>Conference Form 2 or 3, shall mutually develop a professional growth plan,<br/>on the NVUSD Professional Growth Plan Form , designed to assist the unit<br/>member in correcting any cited deficiencies.</p>
<p>11.4.14.1 The professional growth plan may include, but is not limited to<br/>the following:</p>
<p>11.4.15</p>
<p>11.4.16</p>
<p>11.4.17</p>
<p>11.4.18</p>
<p>11.4.14.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific recommendations for improvement;</p>
<p>11.4.14.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct assistance to implement such<br/>recommendations;</p>
<p>11.4.14.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanations of techniques to measure<br/>improvement;</p>
<p>11.4.14.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time schedule to monitor progress; and</p>
<p>11.4.14.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision of resources needed to implement<br/>improvement.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the professional growth plan, the unit member shall be<br/>re-evaluated. The time requirements for the final evaluation will be<br/>extended by the amount of time devoted to the professional growth plan.<br/>The evaluation of members of the unit, except for the alleged violations of<br/>procedural matters, shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.<br/>Evaluation timelines will be waived for teachers serving less than the full<br/>academic year if there is not enough time to meet normal timelines. In any<br/>event Conference Forms 3 will be completed by the end of the academic<br/>year.</p>
<p>Relationship between &quot;Area of Concern&quot; and “Not Effective/Does Not Meet<br/>Standards&quot;</p>
<p>11.4.18.1 It is the intent of the evaluation process that evaluators will notify<br/>evaluatees of deficiencies whenever possible by indicating an<br/>“area of concern” on a Conference Form prior to checking “not<br/>effective/does not meet standards”. A second Conference Form<br/>2 may be given to temporary or probationary teachers no later<br/>than March 15<sup>th</sup> if they were not marked with an &quot;area of<br/>concern&quot; on the first Conference Form 2 and an ’’not<br/>effective/does not meet standards” Conference Form 3 is</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>anticipated. If necessary, the timeline for Conference Form 3<br/>will be extended to ensure a sixty (60) calendar-day lapse<br/>between the final Conference Form 2 and Conference Form 3.<br/>The Conference Form 3 will be completed by the end of the<br/>academic year.</p>
<p>11.4.19 In the event that a permanent teacher is to be re-evaluated the following<br/>year, all six CSTP competencies will be re-evaluated with emphasis given<br/>to areas of deficiency. If on Conference Form 3 all areas are checked<br/>“satisfactory”, the permanent teacher would ordinarily not be evaluated the<br/>following year.</p>
<p>11.5 Dual Evaluators</p>
<p>11.5.1 Dual evaluators include &quot;secondary&quot; and &quot;parallel&quot; Second evaluators may<br/>be involved in the evaluation process at the request of either the evaluatee<br/>or the evaluator, as follows. In both cases, the second evaluator must be a<br/>district administrator certified to evaluate. Whenever a second evaluator is<br/>used, all observations will be included in the personnel file.</p>
<p>11.5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Secondary Evaluator&quot;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondary evaluator provides a</p>
<p>second opinion through classroom observations to the primary<br/>evaluator and teacher. The secondary evaluator should be<br/>designated in Conference 1 by mutual agreement of the primary<br/>evaluator and evaluatee at the request of either party (but may<br/>be requested and designated at any time); the secondary<br/>evaluator completes observations and feedback conferences,<br/>but does not participate in Conference 2 or 3 except by providing<br/>observation data to the teacher and primary evaluator using a<br/>classroom observation form.</p>
<p>11.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Parallel Evaluator&quot;: The parallel evaluator completes the full<br/>process in addition to the primary evaluator. The parallel<br/>evaluator is selected by mutual agreement and must be<br/>designated prior to the completion of Conference 1. Conference<br/>1 may be completed by all parties together (evaluatee and both<br/>evaluators).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>11.5.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parallel evaluator option can be exercised<br/>only after the secondary evaluator option has<br/>been exercised and only if at least one<br/>competency was marked “not effective/does not<br/>meet standards” in the last evaluation.</p>
<p>11.5.1.3 &quot;Replacement Evaluator&quot;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement evaluator</p>
<p>completes the full evaluation process instead of the originally-<br/>designated primary evaluator. The replacement evaluator is<br/>selected by the teacher from a team of several certified<br/>evaluators designated by the district. This option can be<br/>exercised only when requested by the NVEA Executive Board,<br/>the District and/or the District Evaluation Committee and only<br/>when there is agreement that the teacher's employment is in<br/>jeopardy.</p>
<p>11.5.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Replacement Evaluator” option can only be<br/>exercised after the &quot;Secondary&quot; and &quot;Parallel&quot;<br/>options have been exercised.</p>
<p>11.6 Personnel Files</p>
<p>11.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Human Resources shall establish and maintain a file(s)<br/>for each unit member. The file(s) shall be the official District repository for<br/>evaluation records.</p>
<p>11.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials in personnel files of unit members which may serve as a basis for<br/>affecting the status of their employment are to be made available for the<br/>inspection of the member involved.</p>
<p>11.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such material is not to include ratings, reports, or records which:</p>
<p>11.6.3.1 Were obtained prior to the employment of the person involved;</p>
<p>11.6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were prepared by identifiable examination committee members;<br/>or</p>
<p>11.6.3.3 Were obtained in connection with a promotional examination.</p>
<p>11.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every unit member shall have the right to inspect and receive a copy of<br/>such materials upon request, provided that the request is made at a time<br/>when such person is not actually required to render services to the<br/>employing district. The District may make a reasonable charge for such<br/>requested copies when multiple copies are requested or a number of<br/>employees make such a request.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>11.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature, except material mentioned in section</p>
<p>11.6.2, shall not be entered or filed unless and until the unit member is<br/>given notice and an opportunity to review and comment thereon. A<br/>member shall have the right to enter, and have attached to any such<br/>derogatory statement, his/her own comments thereon. Such review shall<br/>take place during normal business hours and the member shall be released<br/>from duty for this purpose without salary reduction.</p>
<p>11.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may have a representative present when he/she inspects<br/>his/her personnel file, or may authorize in writing a representative to review<br/>his/her file.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>ARTICLE 12: PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW</p>
<p>The parties shall meet annually to determine the availability of adequate funding to support<br/>Peer Assistance and Review. In the event that the PAR program (Article 12) receives<br/>dedicated funding the following shall be implemented. In the absence of such dedicated<br/>funding, any appropriate support elements identified in Article 12 will be implemented.</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program</p>
<p>12.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NVUSD and NVEA commit to the improvement of the education of<br/>students by improving the classroom performance of teachers through a<br/>working partnership set forth in AB1X, the California Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Program for Teachers (PAR). In addition to assistance to<br/>teachers participating in AB1X, PAR resources may support Beginning<br/>Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA), California Pre-Internship<br/>Teaching Programs, district intern programs, professional development or<br/>other educational activities, and any program that supports teacher<br/>training.</p>
<p>12.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of supporting teachers participating in AB1X with PAR<br/>resources will not encroach on the program’s ability to support a joint,<br/>broad-based vision of support, nurturing, and professional development<br/>opportunities for all teachers.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation</p>
<p>12.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A participating teacher is a permanent certificated teacher who receives<br/>an “not effective/does not meet standards” rating on his/her Stull/CSTP<br/>evaluation, is referred to the Joint Committee for participation in the PAR<br/>program utilizing the services of a consulting teacher, and takes<br/>advantage of those consulting teacher services.</p>
<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any permanent certificated employee who receives an “not effective/does<br/>not meet standards” rating in the current year Stull/CSTP evaluation<br/>process shall be referred to the Joint Committee and shall be<br/>recommended for participation in the PAR program the following year.</p>
<p>12.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a permanent certificated employee participates in PAR as the result of<br/>“not effective/does not meet standards” performance, the results of that<br/>participation will become part of the employee's current or next<br/>evaluation, conducted by the designated administrator. Results of PAR<br/>participation will be placed in the teacher’s personnel file.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>12.2.4 All teachers will have access to programs supported with PAR resources<br/>which do not require a recommendation from the Joint Committee for<br/>participation. Programs supported with PAR resources include, but are<br/>not limited to:</p>

<p>16.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon notice that the District is going to seek indemnification or to be held<br/>harmless under this provision, the Association shall have the right to meet<br/>with the District regarding the reasonableness and merit of any suit or<br/>action for which the District seeks indemnification and shall attempt to<br/>agree whether any such action listed above in Section 16.4.1 shall be<br/>compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 17: SCHOOL BASED EXCEPTIONS TO THE CBA</p>
<p>17.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this article to allow teams of teachers and administrators at<br/>school sites to respond to specific needs which develop in the process of<br/>implementing school-based shared decision-making which might require<br/>&quot;exceptions without prejudice&quot; to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). It is<br/>the intent of this article to create a review process in the event that there are any<br/>school restructuring projects which are in conflict with this CBA. The District and/or<br/>Association reserve the right to reconsider at any time whether an &quot;exception<br/>without prejudice&quot; is appropriate.</p>
<p>17.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Decision-Making Team</p>
<p>A Shared Decision-Making (SDM) Team will be developed by the District and the<br/>NVEA Executive Board, consisting of an equal number of members, to review and<br/>assist the process, and to mediate disputes when appropriate. An additional<br/>function of the SDM Team will be to ensure that affected staff receives appropriate<br/>training.</p>
<p>17.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDM Team will automatically review proposals which contain<br/>&quot;exceptions&quot; to the CBA to verify the effectiveness and appropriateness of<br/>the change or of the decision-making process. This review will occur as<br/>the Collective Bargaining Agreement expires and is renewed. Exceptions<br/>need the concurrence of the SDM Team for approval.</p>
<p>17.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically excluded from this provision at this time are the Transfer and<br/>Evaluation articles, as well as this article. Contract elements such as<br/>morning break, duty-free lunch, length of workday and number of<br/>workdays will be subject to particular scrutiny by the SDM Team.</p>
<p>17.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific concerns will be referred back to the Staff Team as necessary.</p>
<p>17.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDM Tearn will reach agreement by consensus.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>17.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application</p>
<p>Work sites or subgroups of site staff may apply for exceptions to the CBA - on the<br/>NVEA/NVUSD Proposal for Exceptions to the Collective Bargaining Agreement<br/>Form available on the NVUSD website and the Department of Human Resources.<br/>An Application and Guidelines packet will be developed by the District and<br/>Association on which restructuring proposals or plans should be submitted to the<br/>SDM Team. The packet will enable work teams to clearly identify the nature of the<br/>proposal and will demonstrate that the proposal reflects a genuine consensus of or<br/>a default of an 85% vote of the members who voted.</p>
<p>17.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilization</p>
<p>This process will be used even if agreement on the change has already been<br/>reached and implemented by staff teams unaware of any contract violation.</p>
<p>17.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation</p>
<p>In order to participate in the exception process as stipulated in this article, staff at a<br/>school site must have demonstrated a commitment, as well as experience and/or<br/>training in problem solving and shared decision making. It is intended that all staff<br/>potentially affected by a decision will have the opportunity to participate in the<br/>decision-making process.</p>
<p>17.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who would be significantly affected by a decision will be the<br/>work site group who will participate with the site administrator in the<br/>shared decision-making process. This might include, for example, an<br/>entire school staff, a department, a middle school team, grade level<br/>teams or other units of organization institutionalized at a given school.</p>
<p>17.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teams will demonstrate the utilization of an Interest Based Problem<br/>solving approach by submitting to Human Resources evidence of the<br/>following:</p>
<p>17.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient time was allowed to include all stakeholders;</p>
<p>17.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development of interests and options;</p>
<p>17.5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonable efforts to reach consensus, which is defined here<br/>as “everyone can professionally support this decision”, and;</p>
<p>17.5.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making every effort to reach consensus utilizing an<br/>Interest-Based Problem Solving process, a default vote of 85%<br/>the members who voted will be recognized.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>It is the intent of this article that decisions will be made by consensus,<br/>which is defined here as “everyone can professionally support this<br/>decision”.</p>
<p>17.5.3 The team making the decision will, as the CBA expires and is renewed,<br/>validate and evaluate the effectiveness of any decisions made through<br/>this process.</p>
<p>17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This language has been introduced in the 1991/92 school year as a pilot. The<br/>process will be monitored by NVEA and NVUSD, and will be revised as necessary<br/>to ensure that the spirit of this section as well as the NVUSD/NVEA CBA is being<br/>honored.</p>
<p>17.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest-Based Problem Solving Training</p>
<p>The following Interest-Based Problem Solving training options will be offered to unit<br/>members:</p>
<p>17.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option 1: Initial Training</p>
<p>17.7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A training will be offered annually, utilizing the expertise of<br/>CSEA, NVEA and CTA, to new NVEA site representatives,<br/>new administrators and new Board of Education members.</p>
<p>17.7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This interest-based problem solving training will be completed<br/>before new site representatives may utilize their Role<br/>Recognition and Incentive Program allocation.</p>
<p>17.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option 2: Facilitators - Training and Modeling</p>
<p>The District will offer training for facilitators. District-trained facilitators will<br/>model the interest-based problem solving strategy and facilitate problem<br/>solving meetings for school sites/departments/core groups/ school site<br/>councils, and will be given release time for this purpose.</p>
<p>17.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option 3: In-Depth Training</p>
<p>In-depth training may be needed for total school sites, departments<br/>and/or core groups at the middle schools/high schools, school site<br/>councils, etc.</p>
<p>83</p>
