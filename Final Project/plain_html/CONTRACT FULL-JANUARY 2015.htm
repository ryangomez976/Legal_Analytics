<p>FAIRFIELD-SUISUN UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>FAIRFIELD-SUISUN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>CONTRACT</p>
<p>July 1,2012 - June 30,2014</p>
<p>ARTICLE 1 - RECOGNITION</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District’s Governing Board, hereinafter referred to<br/>as the “Board,” recognizes the Fairfield-Suisun Unified Teachers Association/<br/>CTA/NEA, hereinafter referred to as the “Association,” as the sole and exclusive<br/>bargaining agent for all certificated employees excluding designated management<br/>employees, school psychologists, and per diem substitute employees. Temporary<br/>employees are covered by this agreement only when they achieve temporary status.<br/>Article 18 - Assignment and Transfer, Article 23.5 - Sabbatical Leave, Article 23.6 -<br/>Parental Leave, Article 23.10 - Advanced Study Leave, Article 23.11 - Personal Leave,<br/>Article 24 - Reduced Teaching Service Option, Article 25 - Early Retirement Plan,<br/>Article 26 - Part-Time Contracts, and Article 27 - Job Sharing do not apply to temporary<br/>employees.</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, in turn, recognizes the Board, or designated representative, as the duly<br/>elected representatives of the people and agrees to negotiate exclusively with the Board<br/>through the provisions of the Rodda Act.</p>
<p>1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New classifications created or positions added to classifications shall be subject to<br/>negotiation between the Board and the Association to determine if they are to be included<br/>in the bargaining unit. Disputed cases shall be submitted to the PERB and shall not be<br/>subject to the grievance procedure contained in the contract.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2 - DURATION</p>
<p>2.1 This contract shall become effective July 1, 2012 and continue in effect through<br/>June 30, 2014</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3 - CONTRACT</p>
<p>3.1 This contract shall supersede any rules, regulations, or practices of the Board which shall<br/>be contrary to or inconsistent with its terms.</p>
<p>Each party to this contract may open any article at any time by mutual agreement by both<br/>parties.</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>3.2</p>
<p>3.3 This agreement shall constitute the full and complete commitment between the parties<br/>and shall remain in force for the period of July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2014.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4 ■ NEGOTIATION OF SUCCESSOR AGREEMENT</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall submit its proposal for a successor agreement by the first regular<br/>Board meeting in March 2014.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall make public its response by the first meeting in April 2014. Negotiations<br/>of the successor agreement will commence within ten (10) days after the Board’s public</p>
<p>response.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5 - NO DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the District nor the Association shall discriminate against any employee based on<br/>his or her race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability,<br/>marital status, political affiliation, membership in or participation in an employee<br/>organization, union affiliation, or exercise of rights contained in this Agreement or rights<br/>guaranteed by the EERA. Further, neither the District nor the Association will retaliate<br/>against, discipline or take any adverse action against any employee for participating in or<br/>deciding to not participate in concerted activities protected by the EERA.</p>
<p>5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alleged violations of this Article will be subject to the grievance procedure (including<br/>binding arbitration) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6 - ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall withhold from the salary of each member of F-SUTA the dues in the<br/>Association (which shall include the dues in CTA and NEA, and the total of which shall<br/>be reported to the Assistant Superintendent/Human Resources by August 15 of each year)<br/>and shall transmit the funds withheld to the Association as instructed. Once a bargaining<br/>unit employee joins the Association, membership may only be discontinued during the<br/>month of September of each year covered by this agreement. Unless discontinued, the<br/>member shall remain a member for the duration of this agreement. All deductions shall<br/>be made in ten (10) equal installments for the months of September through June. The<br/>unpaid balance shall be withheld from the final warrant of members leaving the<br/>employment of the District before June 30. This District shall not deduct the dues of any<br/>other organization from the salaries of members of this unit but it shall, at the request of<br/>any member, deduct payments for insurance, tax-sheltered annuities, credit unions, etc.,<br/>up to ten (10) deductions.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the Fairfield-Suisun Unified Teachers<br/>Association/CTA/NEA, or does not make application for membership within thirty (30)</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>days from the date of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit, shall<br/>become a member of the Association or pay to the Association a representation fee in an<br/>amount not to exceed the standard initiation fee, periodic dues and general assessments,<br/>payable to the Association (local, state, national) in one lump sum cash payment in the<br/>same manner as required for the payment of membership dues provided, however, that<br/>the unit member may authorize payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as<br/>provided in Section 6.1 of this article. In the event that a unit member shall not pay such<br/>fee directly to the Association, or authorize payment through payroll deduction as<br/>provided in Section 6.1, the Association shall so inform the District, and the District shall<br/>immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in Education Code Section<br/>45061 and in the same manner as set forth in Section 6.1 of this article. There shall be no<br/>charge to the Association for such mandatory agency fee deductions.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations<br/>shall not be required to join or financially support Fairfield-Suisun Unified Teachers<br/>Association/CTA/NEA as a condition of employment, except that such unit member shall<br/>pay, in lieu of a service fee, sums equal to such service fee to (1) F-SUTA Scholarship<br/>Fund, (2) Assist-a-Grad, (3) F-SUSD Special Account. Such payment shall be made on<br/>or before October 30 of each school year.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of payment and a written statement of objective along with verifiable evidence of<br/>membership in a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings object to joining or<br/>financially supporting employee organizations, pursuant to Article 6.3 above, shall be<br/>made on an annual basis to the Association and District as a condition of continued<br/>exemption from the provisions of Sections 6.2 and 6.3 above. Proof of payment shall be<br/>in the form of receipts and/or cancelled checks indicating the amount paid, date of<br/>payment, and to who payment in lieu of the service fee has been made. Such proof shall<br/>be presented on or before October 30 of each school year.</p>
<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the District pursuant to Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3<br/>above whether for membership dues or agency fee, the District agrees promptly to remit<br/>such monies to the Association accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members for<br/>who such deductions have been made, and indicating any changes in personnel from the<br/>list previously furnished.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member making payments as set forth in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 above, and who<br/>requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this agreement be used in his or her<br/>behalf, shall be responsible for paying to the Association the reasonable cost of using said<br/>grievance or arbitration procedures.</p>
<p>6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-Association unit member may object to the use of any or all of the representation<br/>fee as provided in this section and applicable law. The Association shall establish<br/>procedures in accordance with the Educational Employment Relations Act, constitutional<br/>law, and Chapter 8, Sections 32992 through 32996, of the rules and regulations of the<br/>Public Employment Relations Board for (1) notification of non-Association unit members</p>
<p>of the amount of representation fees, the basis for their calculation and the procedure for<br/>objecting to the use of all or any part of the fee, (2) the filing of financial reports, (3)<br/>appealing the amount of the fee, and (4) the placing in escrow of any representation fees<br/>in dispute.</p>
<p>6.8 Hold Harmless and Indemnity Provision</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, as defined by this agreement, shall hold the District harmless<br/>and shall fully and promptly reimburse the District for reasonable legal fees and<br/>costs incurred in responding to or defending against any legal or administrative<br/>actions which are actually brought against the District or any of its agents by other<br/>than the Association in connection with the administration or enforcement of any<br/>section of this agreement pertaining to representation fee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon notice that the District is going to seek indemnification or to be held<br/>harmless under this provision, the Association shall have the right to meet with<br/>the District regarding the reasonableness and merit of any suit or action for which<br/>the District seeks indemnification and shall attempt to agree whether any such<br/>action listed above in Section 6.8.a. shall be compromised, resisted, defended,<br/>tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall decide and determine whether any such action or<br/>proceeding referred to in Section 6.8.a. shall or shall not be compromised,<br/>resisted, defended, tried, or appealed as long as the District does not have a<br/>distinct and separate legal interest in the matter in dispute.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for any fees or costs, unless<br/>Sections 6.8.b. and 6.8.c. are complied with, and shall not be entitled to such<br/>reimbursement when the District’s efforts in defending against such action would<br/>be duplicative, or when the District is defending a separate and distinct legal<br/>interest, or when the District is defending an activity which is arguably subject to<br/>criminal liability on the part of any District administrator.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7 - CONCERTED ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>By both parties reaching an agreement and signing this document, they agree to actively support<br/>implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8 - DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>The parties agree that definitions will be within the context of the provisions of the contract in<br/>which the term is used.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>ARTICLE 9 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>9.1 Definitions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is an allegation by a grievant that there has been a violation,<br/>misapplication, or misinterpretation of a provision of this agreement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is any member of the unit and/or the Association if either is<br/>adversely affected by a violation, misapplication, or misinterpretation of a<br/>provision of this agreement. In addition, the Association may present a grievance<br/>involving a specific instance involving named unit members.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Day” is any day that the contracted grievant is required to render service to the<br/>District.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate supervisor” is that person having the responsibility for writing the<br/>grievant’s evaluation. When the Association is the grievant, the “immediate<br/>supervisor” in the informal level and Level I will be the Assistant Superintendent/<br/>Human Resources or other person designated by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>9.2 Procedure - Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve the<br/>disagreement by an informal conference with his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>9.3 Procedure - Formal Level</p>
<p>a. Level I:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) days after knowledge of the occurrence of the act or<br/>omission giving rise to the grievance, the grievant must present the<br/>grievance in writing to his/her immediate supervisor. The grievance must<br/>be submitted on the proper grievance form or attached thereto.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the circumstances<br/>giving rise to the grievance, citation of the specific article, section and<br/>paragraph of this agreement that is alleged to have been violated,<br/>misinterpreted, or misapplied, the decision rendered at the informal<br/>conference, and the suggested remedy or remedies sought.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor or designee shall communicate his/her decision in writing<br/>to the employee, and the F-SUTA grievance chairperson within ten (10)<br/>days after receiving the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the grievant or the supervisor may request a personal conference<br/>within the above time limits and such request shall be honored.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>b.</p>
<p>Level II:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the<br/>grievant may appeal the decision to the Director of Elementary Education<br/>or Director of Secondary Education as appropriate according to the<br/>grievant’s assignment within ten (10) days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement should include a copy of the original grievance, the<br/>decision rendered, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the<br/>appeal, and the suggested remedy or remedies sought. The grievance must<br/>be submitted on the proper grievance form or attached thereto.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Elementary Education or Director of Secondary Education<br/>or designee shall conduct an investigation into the allegations and shall<br/>communicate his/her decision in writing to the employee and to the<br/>Association within ten (10) days after receiving the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the grievant or the Director of Elementary Education or Director of<br/>Secondary Education or designee may request a personal conference<br/>within the above time limits and such a request shall be honored.</p>
<p>c. Level III:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance begins at Level III, before filing the grievance, the<br/>Association or grievant with District staff shall conduct a conference with<br/>the appropriate Cabinet level administrator to attempt to resolve or identify<br/>the disagreement. A telephone conference shall fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>After notification by the Association to the Superintendent or designee, the<br/>conference will be held within ten (10) days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, the<br/>grievant may appeal the decision to the Superintendent or designee<br/>(Assistant Superintendent/Human Resources) within ten (10) days. The<br/>grievance must be submitted on the proper grievance form or attached<br/>thereto.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement should include a copy of the original grievance, the<br/>decision rendered, and a clear, concise statement of the reasons for the<br/>appeal, and the suggested remedy or remedies sought.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designee shall conduct an investigation into the<br/>allegations and shall communicate his/her decision in writing to the</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>employee and to the Association within ten (10) days after receiving the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>5. Either the grievant or the Superintendent may request a personal<br/>conference within the above time limits and such request shall be honored.</p>
<p>d. Level IV:</p>
<p>1. If the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at<br/>Level III, it may proceed to arbitration within thirty (30) days. In such<br/>event, the Association shall so notify the Assistant Superintendent of<br/>Human Resources, or his/her designees, in writing. If the District or the<br/>Association requests a meeting to discuss the grievance at any time prior<br/>to a scheduled arbitration hearing, that request shall be honored.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<p>2. a.</p></td><td>
<p>Within ten (10) days of such notification, representatives of the<br/>District and the Association shall attempt to agree upon a mutually<br/>acceptable arbitrator and obtain a commitment from said arbitrator<br/>to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within<br/>the specified period, the Association shall file a Demand to<br/>Arbitrate to the American Arbitration Association. The selection<br/>of the arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted<br/>under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American<br/>Arbitration Association. If the District contends that the grievance<br/>is not arbitrable or the grievant failed to adhere to procedures<br/>herein, such referral shall be primarily to determine the arbitrability<br/>of the alleged grievance. If the arbitrator decides that he/she has<br/>jurisdiction and there is no procedural impediment, he/she shall<br/>proceed to hear the merits of the grievance.</p></td></tr>

<p>ARTICLE 10 - EVALUATION</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed by the parties that the principal objective is to maintain and<br/>improve the quality of education in the District. It is further understood and agreed that<br/>this objective can be more readily achieved by a manifest willingness on the part of the<br/>District to assist all certificated unit members, but especially less experienced unit<br/>members in improving their professional skills. The District accepts as a fundamental<br/>premise for a successful evaluation program, the necessity for mutual respect and<br/>confidence to exist between the evaluator and those evaluated. The evaluation process<br/>and forms shall not be used as retaliation or as a substitute for discipline.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of certificated unit members is based on the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession (CTSP). These Standards are also part of the District’s Beginning<br/>Teacher Support and Assessment Induction Program and the Peer Assistance and Review<br/>Program (PAR). An important component of each of these is the understanding that all<br/>professionals grow and develop. It is, therefore, expected that all final evaluations will<br/>contain individual and personalized suggestions for continued professional development.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated Evaluation Process using CSTP</p>
<p>a. This process will be used to evaluate all certificated unit members:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members will be evaluated once every two (2) years.<br/>Permanent unit members who receive a “Does Not Meet CSTP” or at least<br/>two “Progressing Towards CSTP” ratings on their evaluation may be<br/>evaluated in the subsequent year. The formal evaluation of a permanent<br/>unit member may be deferred to a third year by mutual agreement with<br/>their site administrator. If so, the “once-every-two-year cycle” specified in<br/>this paragraph will start over.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary unit members will be evaluated at least once a year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary unit members will be evaluated at least once a year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the Association, the timeline for a grievance dealing with<br/>a unit member's evaluation will continue from the end of the period of<br/>service in which the evaluation was received, until the beginning of the<br/>following period of service.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Evidence” shall be the measure supporting a rating by an evaluator of a<br/>unit member on the approved observation and evaluation forms. Evidence<br/>shall be a unit member’s Observation Forms, the items listed in 10.3.e and<br/>other objective measures of assessment that relate to the CSTP Standard<br/>being observed or evaluated.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers (PAR Program, Article 14) shall be evaluated<br/>according to the guidelines in Article 14.6.C.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers shall receive training as indicated in Article 10.6.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual or school site unit member trainings to include all unit members will</p>
<p>begin within the first thirty (30) days of the unit member’s work year 60 minutes<br/>for the first year (2013-14) for all teachers and an additional 60 minutes for<br/>probationary and temporary teachers; for all subsequent years 30 minutes for all<br/>teachers and an additional 60 minutes for probationary and temporary teachers by<br/>March 10. Unit members will be evaluated upon the Standards on the form<br/>“Certificated Personnel Evaluation Form, (Appendix K).” All certificated unit<br/>members will be provided with electronic copies of the CSTP: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California</p>
<p>Standards for the Teaching Profession (most recent edition), which provides<br/>detailed information regarding the components of each Standard. Upon request, a<br/>unit member may be provided with a hard copy of the CSTP.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary unit members will be evaluated on all six (6) CSTP<br/>Standards. Documentation provided by the unit member (Probationary,<br/>Temporary or Permanent) to include, but not be limited to, that mentioned in<br/>10.3(e)(5) shall be a part of the evaluation of Standard Six (6).</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two (2) formal observations, one scheduled, and the other may be<br/>scheduled or unscheduled, will be held during a unit member’s evaluation year to<br/>observe unit members using only the District’s Certificated Personnel Observation<br/>Form (Appendix J). These formal observations will be at least thirty (30) minutes<br/>in length. These formal observations may take place any time a certificated unit<br/>member is performing within the scope of his/her classroom duties. The number,<br/>frequency and duration of the observations may vary with the requirements<br/>imposed by the type of class, the needs of the teacher, and individual situation.<br/>Formal observations may be preceded by a pre-conference and must be followed<br/>with a post-conference between the unit member and the evaluator.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorized components of data to validate the CSTP include formal<br/>classroom observations and:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations of less than 30 minutes</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom walk-throughs</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lesson plans as designed by the classroom teacher</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation of report cards and progress reports</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Records of professional development activities as provided by the teacher<br/>(Such documentation shall be a part of the evaluation of Standard 6).</p>
<p>Standardized test scores shall not be used as evaluation data.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following each formal observation, the unit member will receive written feedback<br/>from the evaluator no less than three (3) workdays prior to the post-observation<br/>conference. In addition, post observation conferences must be held no later than<br/>ten (10) workdays following the formal observation. The unit member shall have<br/>the right to comment and have those comments affixed to the said observation<br/>report. Additionally, the administrator and the unit member may mutually agree<br/>to added or modify comments to the observation form at the time of the post¬<br/>observation conference.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will receive a written final evaluation report from the evaluator<br/>no less than five (5) workdays prior to the unit member/evaluator conference. A<br/>final evaluation report in writing and unit member/evaluator conference will be<br/>held at least thirty (30) workdays prior to the last workday of the unit member in<br/>the school year in which the evaluation took place. In completing the final report,<br/>the evaluator will consider the overall performance in the Standards selected in<br/>the initial conference when determining an evaluation rating.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will have the primary responsibility for observations and filing of<br/>observation reports. The principal may assign another on-site administrator these<br/>duties. For Special Education preschool teachers, the primary responsibility for<br/>observations and the evaluation shall be assigned to the Coordinator responsible<br/>for the Special Education preschool programs.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If another onsite administrator is assigned as the primary evaluator, his/her<br/>signature shall appear on both the observation report(s) and evaluation.<br/>The unit member shall be notified of this assignment change in writing.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a designated evaluator is used by the primary evaluator, both signatures<br/>shall appear on the observation report(s) and evaluation. The primary<br/>evaluator shall use no more than two (2) designated evaluators during the<br/>course of the school year.</p>
<p>Additional Obscrvation(s)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may request other observations to be conducted by<br/>members of the administration (requested to be either on-site or off-site)<br/>other than the designated primary administrator. The additional<br/>observation(s) shall be evidence used to determine a unit member’s final<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>i. For each required observation conducted pursuant to section 10.3.d, a<br/>permanent unit member may request and shall receive one (1)<br/>additional observation. The permanent unit member may request that<br/>such observation(s) be conducted by members of the administration<br/>other than the designated primary administrator, including<br/>administrators not assigned to the unit member’s work location. Such<br/>request must be in writing, and made within seven (7) workdays of the<br/>date of the post-observation conference. The additional observation<br/>shall be conducted within twenty (20) workdays of the request. The<br/>time lines specified in section 10.4.a.2 and 10.4.a.3 shall not apply to<br/>any such additional observation(s). The additional observation(s) shall<br/>be evidence used to determine a unit member’s final evaluation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall evaluate another unit member.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 12 - PARENT COMPLAINTS</p>
<p>A parent complaint is defined as the parent or guardian’s expression of dissatisfaction or concern<br/>over the actions of a unit member which is related to the welfare of the parent’s or guardian’s<br/>child or children enrolled in said unit member’s class or under his/her supervision. Parent<br/>complaints shall not address the unit member’s instruction of the District-adopted curriculum<br/>within the unit member’s assignment. The individual charging the complaint shall hereafter be<br/>referred to as the individual complainant. The complaint shall only be considered if the event<br/>that initiated the complaint took place within the preceding twenty five (25) workdays. The<br/>resolution of complaints made during the last twenty five (25) workdays prior to the unit<br/>member’s vacation may, at the option of the unit member, be suspended for the period of<br/>vacation. An individual parent or guardian of a student in the District lodging a complaint<br/>concerning a unit member must do so by adhering to the following procedure in presenting such<br/>a complaint.</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this section, a “day” is defined as a day that the unit member is required<br/>to render service to the District.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Procedure</p>
<p>a. The individual complainant shall first meet informally with the unit member on an<br/>individual basis to discuss the concerns of the individual complainant and<br/>constructively work to resolve the matter. If the principal or immediate supervisor<br/>is contacted by the parent, he/she shall direct the parent to the unit member<br/>involved or inform the unit member of the nature of the contact. Either the<br/>individual complainant or the unit member may request the immediate supervisor<br/>to be present during the informal procedure. If present, the immediate supervisor<br/>may act as a facilitator during the informal procedure. The immediate supervisor<br/>shall act only as a facilitator, and not as an advocate during the informal<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Superintendent or another member of the management team is contacted by<br/>an individual parent, he/she shall direct the parent to the unit member’s immediate<br/>supervisor.

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the concern is brought to the attention of the unit member in writing on the<br/>proper form prior to the end of the day, the unit member shall have the option of<br/>not returning to the classroom for the remainder of the day. In the event the<br/>concern is brought to the unit member before the school’s lunch period and<br/>providing the District is able to secure a qualified substitute, the employee will be<br/>allowed to leave school for the remainder of the day with no loss of leave.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is not resolved at the informal level, the formal procedure shall be<br/>implemented.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall have the right to appeal the principal or immediate<br/>supervisor’s decision to the Assistant Superintendent/Human Resources.</p>
<p>12.3 Formal Procedure</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the individual complainant is not satisfied with the resolution of the matter,<br/>he/she shall prepare the complaint in writing on a form developed jointly by the<br/>District and Association within twenty five (25) days of notification of proposed<br/>resolution and submit it to the principal or immediate supervisor who will notify<br/>the unit member involved within two (2) days. The immediate supervisor may<br/>arrange a meeting with the complainant and unit member. The immediate<br/>supervisor shall investigate the matter of concern stated in the complaint and<br/>submit a written response to the complainant and the unit member within ten (10)<br/>workdays. The response shall be discussed at a joint meeting of the immediate<br/>supervisor, the complainant and unit member. The immediate supervisor shall act<br/>as recorder and facilitator in the process. The immediate supervisor shall<br/>determine if a record of the incident merits placement in the unit member’s file. If<br/>the complaint is dropped due to lack of merit, no written report shall be placed in<br/>the unit member’s file. No material may be placed in a unit member’s file or used<br/>in any disciplinary procedure unless such material has been submitted to the unit<br/>member for inspection and signature. The unit member also has the right to attach<br/>a rebuttal.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the individual complainant or unit member is not satisfied with the proposed<br/>resolution, he/she may within ten (10) workdays appeal the principal’s or<br/>immediate supervisor’s response to the Assistant Superintendent/Human<br/>Resources or his/her designee. The Assistant Superintendent/Human Resources<br/>or his/her designee shall review the complaint and may repeat the process outlined<br/>in Article 12.3.a or concur with the finding(s) made pursuant to that provision.<br/>He/she shall have ten (10) workdays to set up a meeting or to respond in writing.</p>
<p>He/she shall also decide to place the complaint in or exclude the complaint from<br/>the unit member’s file under the provisions of Article 12.3.a.</p>
<p>c. If the individual complainant or unit member is not satisfied with the proposed<br/>resolution, he/she may within ten (10) workdays appeal the Assistant<br/>Superintendent/Human Resources or designee’s response to the Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall review the<br/>complaint and may repeat the process outlined in Article 12.3.a or concur with the<br/>finding(s) made pursuant to the provisions of Article 12.3.b. He/she shall have<br/>ten (10) workdays to set up a meeting or to respond in writing. He/she shall also<br/>decide to place the complaint in or exclude the complaint from the unit member’s<br/>file under the provisions of Article 12.3.a.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 13 - EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains the right to take appropriate action to discipline unit members.<br/>Notwithstanding other provision(s) of this agreement, no unit member shall be<br/>disciplined without just cause, due process, and the utilization of progressive discipline.<br/>This will not apply to non-reemployment of probationary employees and to the release of<br/>temporary employees.</p>
<p>The following just cause guidelines shall be recognized:</p>

<p>ARTICLE 18 - ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER</p>
<p>18.1 Definitions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer is considered to be the movement of a certificated person to a different<br/>school.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assignment is considered to be the position of a certificated person within a<br/>school.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassignment is a change of position within a school or within the Special<br/>Education Department.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated vacancy is an unfilled certificated position.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day would be a day the District is open for business.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>18.2 Procedure for Filling Vacancies-Voluntarv Transfer and Reassignment</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Office will complete on or before May 1 of each school<br/>year a list of all certificated employees requesting transfer, reassignment, or<br/>movement to an administrative vacancy for vacancies occurring after June 1. This<br/>list will be confidential information of the Human Resources Office.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the end of the traditional school year, the Assistant Superintendent/<br/>Human Resources will publish a list of anticipated vacancies for the following<br/>school year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a certificated vacancy becomes available, the vacancy will be made known<br/>to all certificated members assigned to the school within three (3) days of<br/>notification, so any unit member assigned to the school may volunteer for the<br/>vacancy.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel assigned to more than one site, e.g., librarians, P.E. teachers, music<br/>teachers, program managers, etc. (except for special education personnel), shall be<br/>assigned by October 1 of each school year a site as home base. The site<br/>designated would usually be the site at which they are evaluated and/or spend the<br/>majority of their time. At the designated site, these personnel would be allowed to<br/>interview as in-house candidates provided they are credentialed for the position<br/>for which they are interviewing.</p>
<p>Assignment of staff working at more than one site shall be considered a<br/>reassignment under this article.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within three (3) days of notification, any unit member assigned to the school may<br/>volunteer for the vacancy. If the principal appoints the volunteer to the vacancy,<br/>the vacancy closes.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the vacancy still available after completion of Article 18.2.e.<br/>shall be posted at all school sites and at the District Office for a period of five (5)<br/>days. During the school vacation periods, all certificated members who have<br/>indicated interest in the vacancy through the annual list shall be notified of the<br/>opening. It shall be the unit member’s responsibility to leave self-addressed<br/>envelopes with the Human Resources Office or to call the designated vacancy<br/>telephone number and follow instructions concerning openings.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vacancy still exists after Article 18.2.f. above, the Superintendent or<br/>designee may assign a newly-hired person for the vacancy.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>18.3 Criteria and Procedures for Involuntary Reassignments and Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>18.4</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining reassignments and transfers due to reduction in work force,<br/>declining enrollment, or restructuring/reconfiguring, the following criteria (in<br/>descending order of importance) shall be used:</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of service to the District</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstrated special skills</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sex, ethnic and racial balance</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a particular school is to be closed, as determined by School Board action, or<br/>program eliminated, unit members will be given first preference to select from<br/>new or vacant positions within the District. Unit members will select positions<br/>based upon District seniority as outlined in item, Article 18.4 below. If the Board<br/>rescinds the action (e.g., site closing) before the beginning of that school’s next<br/>school year, displaced unit members will have the right to return to original<br/>position and/or site.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that the District will make involuntary transfers and involuntary<br/>reassignments according to the following bands: Unit members shall be assigned<br/>within Bands according to credential. “Bands” as described herein shall be<br/>defined as primary elementary grade levels (K-3), upper elementary grade levels<br/>(4-6) and middle school levels and high school levels according to credential.</p>

<p>21.1</p>
<p>21.2</p>
<p>21.3</p>
<p>Class sizes are guided by restrictions established by law. Each principal will arrange<br/>student enrollment in classes so it will provide the best educational opportunity possible<br/>for the student within the economic constraints of the District.</p>

<p>Special Services</p>
<p>a. Individual caseload shall not exceed the following for more than twenty (20) days<br/>in any school year:</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Day Class (SDC) caseload maximum for programs serving<br/>students with learning, communication, and/or cognitive disabilities will<br/>be sixteen (16) for K-6 and seventeen (17) for 7-12 grade level programs.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Seriously Emotionally Disturbed (SED) caseload maximum will be</p>
<p>twelve (12) for elementary and fourteen (14) for 6-8 and 9-12.</p>
<p>b. When caseload reaches eight (8) for elementary and ten (10) for 6-<br/>8 and 9-12, the unit member may initiate the Caseload/Class Size<br/>Resolution Procedure. Except, elementary SED classes involved in<br/>the Program for Effective Relationships and Learning (PERL)<br/>Program shall be staffed with 12 hours of instructional assistance<br/>time daily at the start of the school year, for unit members in the<br/>PERL program for the entire year. Therefore, for the PERL<br/>Program, as class caseloads increase throughout the school year,<br/>additional instructional assistance time shall not be provided,<br/>unless specified by an individual student’s Individual Educational<br/>Plan (IEP).</p>
<p>This is the Resolution Procedure:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member may write a letter to the Director of Special<br/>Education about the problem.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within five (5) working days, the unit member and Director<br/>of Special Education will meet and determine the current<br/>class size/caseload. Possible solutions will be explored.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an agreement is reached, it will be implemented<br/>within ten (10) working days. This solution may<br/>include, but not be restricted to, the removal of the<br/>student(s) from the class list/caseload or except for<br/>Elementary SED classes involved in the PERL<br/>Program, additional instructional assistant time.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no agreement is reached, a class size committee<br/>will be formed. This committee will meet within ten</p>
<p>(10) working days. The committee will be composed<br/>of two (2) special education teachers chosen by the<br/>unit member, one (1) F-SUTA representative, one (1)<br/>special education administrator, one (1) site<br/>administrator, and one (1) additional member<br/>appointed by the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources. A decision shall be reached by consensus.<br/>The decision shall be implemented within ten (10)<br/>working days.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caseload limits shall only be exceeded by two (2) at the K-6 and three (3)<br/>at the 7-12 program levels.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preschool SDC class size will be no greater than eighteen (18) students per<br/>FTE preschool teacher.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource Specialist Program/Leaming Center: Per Education Code - 28<br/>students. Upon approval by both the RSP teacher and the District, the<br/>RSP caseload may be increased to a maximum of 32 students with<br/>application of the state-approved waiver process. Resource Specialist<br/>Program caseload includes responsibility for completion of mandated<br/>annual and three-year review IEPs. At sites with more than 1 FTE RSP<br/>teacher, “caseload” may be split with agreement by the staff members<br/>involved and the program supervisor, so a staff member has an IEP<br/>assessment and paperwork caseload greater than 28, concurrent with<br/>reduced instructional contact. However, at no time may the combined<br/>“caseloads” at the site be greater than 28 students per FTE RSP teacher<br/>without application for a state-approved waiver.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the education code limit on Resource Specialist caseload,<br/>elementary Resource Specialist teachers in a learning center shall have a<br/>caseload limit of 22 students. This reduced caseload is to ensure that the<br/>Resource Specialist/Leaming Center teacher has the opportunity to consult<br/>and collaborate with other staff to address the needs of students and to<br/>provide in-class support in the general education classroom, as<br/>appropriate.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designated Instructional Services: 55 District average caseload (Speech<br/>and Language, Adaptive P.E., Orientation and Mobility).</p>
<p>b. Class size maximums will remain as of present or as defined by Code. Any<br/>variance in class size ratio due to the impact of legislation after the ratification of<br/>this agreement will be subject to negotiations.</p>
<p>21.4 Special Education Learning Centers</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Learning Center setting, SDC students will be weighted at 1.75 per student<br/>and RSP students as one (1.0) per student when calculating weighted case<br/>management and weighted instructional caseloads.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weighted case management caseload shall not exceed 22 (twenty-two) per<br/>individual Learning Center teacher unless agreed to by the teacher.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in compliance with the site’s School Based Coordination Plan, students without<br/>IEPs may be included on a Learning Center teacher’s weighted instructional<br/>caseload for RSP level services. These students without IEPs shall count as one<br/>(1.0) on the Learning Center teacher’s weighted instructional caseload. At no<br/>time shall the weighted instructional caseload exceed 22 (twenty-two) when<br/>students without IEPs are included as part of that caseload.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this Article 21.4, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p>Learning Center - One of a continuum of service delivery models available to<br/>Special Education students. A Learning Center is a setting where one or more<br/>Learning Center teachers jointly provide services to both SDC and RSP students<br/>who are assigned to general education classrooms for a period of time indicated<br/>on the students’ Individualized Educational Plan (IEP).</p>
<p>Weighted case management caseload - The students, weighted as per 21.4.a., for<br/>whom a Learning Center teacher has the responsibility for planning and writing<br/>Individual Educational Plans as well as monitoring the students’ progress toward<br/>achievement of IEP goals and objectives through observation, collaboration<br/>and/or assessment.</p>
<p>21.5 Speech and Language Therapists / Pathologists</p>
<p>The Association and the District agree that it is the purpose and the intention to fill all<br/>open Speech and Language Therapist positions with qualified full-time and/or part-time<br/>unit members.</p>
<p>Caseload</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree to a maximum caseload for Speech and<br/>Language Therapists. After a grace period of ten (10) days of student attendance,<br/>from the beginning of the school year or the beginning of each semester; for<br/>grades 7-12, individual caseloads shall not exceed the following maximums:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary and Secondary......55 maximum caseload</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preschool...........................40 maximum &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caseload</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech and Language Therapist unit members whose caseload exceeds the<br/>maximum caseload shall be paid at the same rate already established for the other<br/>unit members who exceed class size limits.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Salary and Fringe Benefits - Article 22.1.f.) All qualifying Speech and Language<br/>Therapists who hold the Certificate of Clinical Competence in Speech - Language<br/>Pathology shall receive a yearly stipend of $2,000. This stipend shall be<br/>retroactive to July 1, 2007. Payment of stipend upon ratification of the 2007-2008<br/>Contract.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the current crisis in finding credentialed speech therapists, the Association<br/>and the District recognize that there may be a need to temporarily employ<br/>ancillary Speech and Language Therapists from other agencies until the requisite<br/>number of full-time Speech Therapist unit members can be employed. The<br/>District and the Association shall meet at least annually to determine the needs for<br/>such ancillary Speech and Language Therapists.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall first assign Speech and Language Therapists to no more than<br/>two (2) sites. If this assignment configuration proves inoperable, the next step<br/>shall be assigning ancillary Speech Therapists to alleviate the problem. If, after<br/>this adjustment, it is still not possible to assign Speech Therapists to no more than<br/>two (2) sites, their assignments to the increased sites shall be done in a fashion to<br/>create the least impact on the Speech Therapist’s caseload.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech and Language Therapists assigned to multiple sites shall not be placed on<br/>the school site’s yard duty schedule due to I.E.P. meetings, travel time, and the<br/>flexibility needed to schedule services for students.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District shall form a pilot Speech and Language<br/>Committee for the 2008-2009 School Year. The Committee shall meet at least<br/>one time during the 2007-2008 school year to set a calendar for meeting dates for<br/>the 2008-2009 School Year. The Committee shall meet at least quarterly to<br/>address the needs of Speech and Language Therapists listed below. The<br/>Association shall appoint three (3) unit members and the District shall appoint<br/>three (3) administrators to the Speech and Language Committee. The Committee<br/>shall begin meeting no later than October 2008 and report to the bargaining parties<br/>on an ongoing basis regarding:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development, implementation and assessment of the Three-to-One<br/>Program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruitment and retention of Speech and Language Therapists — the<br/>Committee shall investigate the possibilities of the District acting alone or<br/>in a consortium, setting up a credentialing program and other incentives<br/>for current unit members and outside candidates to become Speech and<br/>Language Therapists.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work site issues designed to improve the ability of therapists to deliver<br/>services and alleviate them from clerical tasks.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore ways to weight students for more effective services.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other issues as deemed necessary by the Speech and Language<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>h. The Speech and Language Committee shall evaluate the usefulness of the<br/>Committee before the close of the 2008-2009 school year and bring<br/>recommendations to the bargaining parties about its continuance.</p>
<p>21.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caseload: Teachers Without Formal Enrollments</p>
<p>A teacher of a class without formal enrollments (e.g., K-6 music, P.E., and library) will<br/>be responsible during any given period for no more students than the maximum<br/>designated in Article 21.2 except with the teacher’s consent.</p>
<p>21.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caseload: Workstations</p>
<p>The number of students enrolled in each class shall not exceed by more than five (5) the<br/>number of work stations in that class. The number of work stations in a class is exceeded<br/>if:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of students exceeds the number of desks; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is insufficient space or equipment to perform normal classroom activities.</p>
<p>21.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caseload Equalization</p>
<p>For the purpose of equalizing teaching loads, the following shall be implemented within<br/>twenty (20) teaching days at the beginning of each school year, or at the beginning of<br/>each semester for grades 7-12:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource specialist program students in grades K-6 shall be divided equally at the<br/>beginning of the year among classes at any given grade level plus or minus one (1)<br/>student. Students receiving resource specialist services may be grouped in general<br/>education classes with annually renewed mutual agreement between affected<br/>general education teachers and the Resource Specialist/Learning Center teacher<br/>with input from the prior school year’s teacher, as appropriate, with subsequent<br/>approval of the site administrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource specialist program students in grades 7-12 shall be divided equally<br/>among classes in any given subject area plus or minus one (1) student within the<br/>constraints of scheduling.</p>
<p>21.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle School and Secondary School Additional Periods</p>
<p>A tenured middle or secondary teacher may volunteer to teach six (6) periods per day<br/>during the first or second semester with a maximum of 204 students. During the alternate<br/>semester, he/she would teach no more than four (4) periods per day with a maximum of<br/>136 students. When a unit member agrees to this portion of the contract, the agreement<br/>shall be put in writing and signed by the unit member and the Assistant Superintendent/<br/>Human Resources. This program will be limited to four (4) teachers per school site and</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>ten (10) periods per teacher per school year. It is not the intent of the District to reduce<br/>the importance of the work period; the intent is to reduce class size.</p>
<p>21.10 Academic Support Teachers and Curriculum and Instruction Coaches K-12</p>
<p>Provisions for the Academic Support Teachers and the Curriculum and Instruction<br/>Coaches K-12 positions are as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic Support Teacher</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Academic Support Teacher shall not report, orally or put in writing any<br/>observations from unit members’ classrooms that may or could be used in<br/>evaluation or provide commentary that would effectively recommend the<br/>same.

Differential pay shall be the difference between<br/>the employee’s daily rate of pay and that of a regular day-to-day substitute. The<br/>differential pay shall commence when an employee has exhausted accumulated sick leave<br/>and shall continue for five (5) months.</p>
<p>23.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>a. Creation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to create the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Bank effective July 1, 1993. The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be funded<br/>in accordance with the terms of Section b. below.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank<br/>without regard to the daily rate of pay of the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>participant.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L-SUTA Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by a three (3)<br/>member Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee appointed by the President<br/>of the Association. <sup>66</sup></p>
<p>66</p>
<p>b. Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members on active duty with the District are eligible to contribute<br/>to the F-SUTA Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires contribution to the Bank. Only<br/>contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who elect not to join the Catastrophic Leave Bank upon<br/>first becoming eligible have a waiting period of thirty (30) days after<br/>joining the Bank before becoming eligible to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution, on the appropriate form, will be authorized by the unit<br/>member and continued from year to year until cancelled by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation occurs automatically whenever a unit member fails to make<br/>his/her annual contribution or assessment. Cancellation, on the proper<br/>form, may be effected at any time and the unit member shall not be<br/>eligible to draw from the Bank as of the effective date of cancellation.<br/>Sick leave previously authorized for contribution to the Bank shall not be<br/>returned if the unit member effects cancellation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each school<br/>year. Unit members returning from extended leave which included the<br/>enrollment period and new hires will be permitted to contribute within<br/>thirty (30) calendar days of beginning work. The District shall supply<br/>enrollment forms for the Catastrophic Leave Bank to all new unit<br/>members and those unit members returning from leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of contribution by each participating unit member for each<br/>school year shall be one (1) day of sick leave which shall be deemed to<br/>equate to the legal minimum required by Education Code Section 44043.5.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional day of contribution will be required of participants if<br/>the number of days in the Bank falls below five hundred (500)<br/>days. Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are drawing from<br/>the Bank at the time of the assessment will not be required to<br/>contribute to remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank participant has no remaining sick leave at<br/>the time of the assessment, they need not contribute the additional<br/>day to remain a participant in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days in the Bank at the beginning of a school year<br/>exceeds fifteen hundred (1,500) days, no contribution shall be<br/>required of returning unit members. Those unit members joining <sup>67</sup></p>
<p>67</p>
<p>the Catastrophic Leave Bank for the first time and those returning<br/>from leave shall be required to contribute one (1) day to the Bank.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are retiring or leaving the employ of the District may<br/>contribute their unused sick leave to the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 31 of each school year, the total contribution of participating<br/>unit members will be placed in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>c. Withdrawal From the Bank</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants, whose sick leave is exhausted, may<br/>withdraw from the Bank for catastrophic illness or injury. Catastrophic<br/>illness or injury shall be defined as any illness or injury that incapacitates<br/>the unit member for over ten (10) consecutive duty days or incapacitates a<br/>member of the unit member’s family for over ten (10) consecutive duty<br/>days which requires the unit member to take time off work to care for that<br/>family member. If a reoccurrence or a second illness or injury<br/>incapacitates a unit member or member of the unit member’s family<br/>within twelve (12) months, it shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5)<br/>consecutive duty days. Thus, a participant who used the Bank after<br/>exhaustion of sick leave for twenty-five (25) days to care for his wife who<br/>dies of cancer and, after returning to work, suffers a heart attack shall be<br/>deemed to have a second catastrophic illness and may again withdraw<br/>from the Bank after only five (5) consecutive duty days off work.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must use all sick leave (but not differential leave) as defined<br/>in Article 23.1 available to them before eligible for a withdrawal from the<br/>Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants who have exhausted sick leave but still have differential leave<br/>available are eligible for a withdrawal from the Catastrophic Leave Bank.<br/>The District shall pay the participant full pay and the Bank shall be<br/>charged forty percent (40%) of the day.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten (10) duty days of illness or disability must be covered by the<br/>participant’s own sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay the<br/>first time said participant qualifies for a withdrawal from the Bank. For<br/>subsequent withdrawals, within twelve (12) consecutive months, the first<br/>five (5) duty days of illness must be covered by the participant’s own sick<br/>leave, differential leave, or leave without pay.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant is incapacitated, applications may be submitted to the<br/>Committee by the participant’s agent or member of the participant’s<br/>family. <sup>68</sup></p>
<p>68</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be granted in units of<br/>no more than thirty (30) duty days. Participants may submit requests for<br/>extensions of withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A participant’s<br/>withdrawal from the Bank may not exceed the statutory maximum period<br/>of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank will be required to submit a doctor’s statement<br/>indicating the nature of the illness or injury and the probable length of<br/>absence from work. Members of the Committee shall keep information<br/>regarding the nature of the illness confidential. A participant’s withdrawal<br/>may not exceed the statutory maximum period of twelve (12) consecutive<br/>months.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant has drawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank days and<br/>requests an extension, the Committee may require a medical review by a<br/>physician of the Committee’s choice at the participant’s expense. The<br/>Committee shall choose only a physician who qualifies under the District<br/>offered insurance policy. Refusal to submit to the medical review will<br/>terminate the participant’s continued withdrawal from the Bank. The<br/>Committee may deny an extension of withdrawal from the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank based upon the medical report. The participant may appeal<br/>any termination under the procedures outlined in Section 13 below.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability which<br/>qualify the participant for Worker’s Compensation benefits unless the<br/>participant has exhausted all Worker’s Compensation leave, his/her own<br/>sick leave, and provided further that the member signs over any Worker’s<br/>Compensation checks for temporary benefits to the District. If there are<br/>any Worker’s Compensation checks signed over to the District, the Bank<br/>will not be charged days or, if charged, will be reimbursed the number of<br/>days for which the Worker’s Compensation payment is equivalent to a<br/>regular day of pay at the negotiated rate for that participant. If the District<br/>challenges the Worker’s Compensation claim, the participant may draw<br/>from the Bank but, upon settlement of the claim, the Bank shall be<br/>reimbursed the appropriate number of days by the District.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee may reasonably presume that the applicant for a<br/>draw may be eligible for a disability award or a retirement under STRS or,<br/>if applicable. Social Security, the Committee may request that the<br/>applicant apply for disability or retirement. Failure of the applicant to<br/>submit a complete application, including medical information provided by<br/>the applicant’s physician, within twenty (20) calendar days, will disqualify<br/>him/her for further Catastrophic Leave Bank payments. Any requests for<br/>additional medical information from STRS or Social Security shall be<br/>submitted within ten (10) days or the participant’s entitlement to <sup>69</sup></p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Bank payments will cease. If denied benefits by STRS<br/>or Social Security, the applicant must appeal or the entitlement to the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall cease.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to fund a<br/>withdrawal request, the Committee is under no obligation to provide days<br/>and the District is under no obligation to pay the participant any funds<br/>whatsoever. If the Committee denies a request for withdrawal or an<br/>extension of withdrawal because of insufficient days to fund the request,<br/>they shall notify the participant, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the exhaustion of<br/>sick leave or the waiting periods provided for in Sections 2.3 and 3.4,<br/>whichever is greater. For example, if a participant contributed when first<br/>eligible to contribute (Section 3) and had ten (10) days of accumulated<br/>sick leave when the illness began (Section 4), he/she shall begin<br/>withdrawing upon the eleventh (11th) duty day if otherwise eligible. If the<br/>participant had fifteen (15) days of sick leave at the beginning of the<br/>illness, he/she shall begin withdrawing days on the sixteenth (16th) duty<br/>day. If the participant had five (5) days of sick leave at the beginning of<br/>the illness, he/she shall begin withdrawing days on the eleventh (11th)<br/>duty day.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are denied a withdrawal or<br/>whose withdrawal is not renewed or terminated may, within thirty (30)<br/>days of denial, appeal, in writing, to the Executive Board of the<br/>Association. The Executive Board of the Association shall hold a hearing<br/>within fifteen (15) duty days. The Executive Board shall issue a<br/>confidential written decision within fifteen (15) duty days of the hearing.<br/>If the participant’s incapacitation does not allow participation in this<br/>appeal process, the participant’s agent or member of the family may<br/>process the appeal.</p>
<p>d. Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank Committee shall have the responsibility of<br/>maintaining the records of the Catastrophic Leave Bank by receiving<br/>withdrawal requests, verifying the validity of requests, approving or<br/>denying the requests, and communicating its decisions, in writing, to the<br/>participants and to the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the Bank.<br/>The Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests complying<br/>with the terms of this article.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications shall be reviewed and decisions of the Committee reported to<br/>the applicant, in writing, within ten (10) duty days of receipt of the<br/>application.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose<br/>the nature of the illness except as is necessary to process the request for<br/>withdrawal and defend against any appeals of denials.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By November 5 of each school year, the District shall notify the<br/>Committee of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of accumulated days in the Bank on June 30th of<br/>the previous school year.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of days remaining in the Bank on the last day of<br/>the month.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute between the Committee and the District as to the accounting<br/>of Catastrophic Leave Bank days shall be immediately submitted to</p>
<p>Binding Arbitration without the need to follow earlier steps of the<br/>grievance procedure as per Article 9.</p>
<p>8. If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days<br/>remaining in the Bank shall be returned to the then current members of the<br/>Bank proportionately.</p>
<p>23.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave may be used by an employee in cases of personal necessity. Leave over<br/>two (2) days in duration will require the prior approval of the Assistant<br/>Superintendent/Human Resources or his/her designee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Personal necessity” means circumstances that are serious in nature to the<br/>employee and that the employee cannot reasonably be expected to disregard, that<br/>necessitates immediate attention, that cannot be taken care of after work hours or<br/>on weekends.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not be taken for recreational travel, to engage in other<br/>employment, or to participate in Association-related political activities,</p>
<p>demonstrations, or causes.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abuse of the above guidelines will result in a letter of reprimand in the discipline<br/>process and loss of pay.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees may take personal necessity leave in half-day increments.</p>
<p>23.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may grant a sabbatical leave to unit members upon request.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be eligible for sabbatical leave, a person shall have been employed by<br/>the District continuously for at least ten (10) years. The application for sabbatical<br/>leave must be made by February 1 preceding the year the leave is desired.</p>

Failure<br/>to complete this requirement will require the employee to return the amount of<br/>money paid by the District to the employee during the sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>23.6 Parental Leave</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parental leave shall be defined as benefits provided for by Section 44977 of the<br/>Education Code for absences necessitated by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth<br/>and recovery therefrom.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differential pay will be provided as stipulated in Article 23.6.a. above, for<br/>a maximum of sixty (60) consecutive work days, to commence no sooner<br/>than forty (40) work days prior to the anticipated first day of disability.</p>

When an industrial accident or illness leave occurs at a time when the<br/>leave will overlap into the next fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only that<br/>amount of leave remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the industrial injury or<br/>accident occurred for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>Industrial accident or illness leave is to be used in lieu of normal sick leave benefits.<br/>When entitlement to industrial accident or illness leave under this section has been<br/>exhausted, entitlement to other sick leave will be used. If, however, the employee<br/>continues to receive temporary disability indemnity under the Worker’s Compensation<br/>laws of this state at the time of the exhaustion of benefits under this section, the employee<br/>may elect to take as much of the employee’s accumulated and available sick leave which,<br/>when added to the Worker’s Compensation award, results in a payment of not more than<br/>the employee’s regular salary.</p>
<p>An employee requesting industrial accident and illness leave benefits may be required to<br/>comply with the medical verification and reporting provisions of the sick leave section of<br/>this article.</p>
<p>Upon complying with District medical release requirements and receiving District<br/>authorization to return to work, an employee on industrial accident or illness leave shall<br/>be reinstated to the same position when the accident or illness occurred without loss of<br/>status or benefits.</p>
<p>A unit member shall be deemed to have recovered from an industrial accident or illness,<br/>and thereby able to return to work, at such time as he/she and his/her physician agree that<br/>there has been such a recovery. The District, at its cost, may request another medical<br/>opinion.</p>

<p>APPENDIX O</p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding<br/>Between</p>
<p>Fairfield-Suisun Unified Teachers Association<br/>And</p>
<p>Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District</p>
<p>May 22, 2014</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding is to create:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modify the job description of Consulting Teachers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extend Consulting Teacher terms of service to five (5) years.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create staggered terms for Consulting Teachers so that consulting terms are in a<br/>staggered fashion.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Human Resources Department shall maintain records regarding the terms of<br/>Consulting Teachers and shall notify the PAR Committee of pending vacancies due to<br/>the expiration of terms. Additionally, the Human Resources Department shall notify the<br/>PAR Committee if a vacancy occurs between terms.</p>
<p>Rationale: Having moved to the new SB2042 Induction Program, qualifying new teachers are<br/>placed into the BTSA Program for two (2) years. Consulting Teachers have different<br/>responsibilities to help ensure that all qualifying new teachers complete all requirements of the<br/>SB2042 Induction Program. Creating terms more closely aligned with the BTSA SB2042<br/>Program would be beneficial to all concerned parties. Since a great deal of time, energy and<br/>expense go into the “retooling” of a teacher for the Consulting Teacher role it is more cost<br/>effective to have the Consulting Teacher serve a five (5) year term.</p>
<p>Transition procedure for staggering terms:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on District seniority, the current Consulting Teachers will select a position from<br/>the attached chart. One position (1) will conclude at the end of the 2015-2016 school<br/>year; one position (2) will conclude at the end of the 2016-2017 school year; three<br/>positions (3, 4, and 5) will conclude at the end of the 2017-2018 school year; two<br/>positions (6 and 7) will conclude at the end of the 2018-2019 school year.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attached chart clarifies the transition of terms and the overall effect. The creation of<br/>additional Consulting Teacher positions would be for a five-year (5) term.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent Consulting Teachers hired, will be hired for a five-year (5) term.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties will jointly determine the date of the Selection Process outlined above upon<br/>the singing of this memorandum.</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding will become effective upon signature of both bargaining<br/>parties. This Memorandum of Understanding will be added to the Collective Bargaining</p>

<p>Hai'd to Fill Positions</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>j</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize that, due to current labor market conditions, it is<br/>difficult for the District to recruit and hire employees in certain positions within the bargaining<br/>unit. Therefore, the District and the Association agree as follows:</p>
<p>The District has identified the following positions as being hard-to-fill: Speech Therapists and<br/>Nurses.</p>
<p>The District shall pay a one-time hiring bonus of $5,000 to each fully-credentialed Speech<br/>Therapist or Nurse hired after the date of the signing of this MOU provided they hold the proper<br/>preliminary or clear credential for the position to which they have been assigned.</p>
<p>The hiring bonus payment will be prorated based on FTE, not to exceed 1.0 FTE. The hiring<br/>bonus shall be paid in two (2) equal payments, fifty percent at signing and the other fifty percent<br/>at the completion of one (1) year of service. All payments will be subject to ordinary deductions<br/>for payroll tax purposes.</p>
<p>Existing unit members who hold die appropriate credentials listed above, but who are not<br/>currently in positions which require those credentials, shall also be eligible, one time only, to<br/>receive the hiring bonuses if they are selected and agree to fill open positions.</p>
<p>All certificated staff receiving hiring bonuses shall not be eligible to transfer out of the job<br/>classification without District approval for three years. However, nothing in this Memorandum<br/>of Understanding shall be construed to grant to any unit member the right to continue in any<br/>position or in employment with the District for any period of time.</p>
<p>This agreement shall be in effect from date of signature through June 30, 2015 and may be<br/>renewed only upon mutual consent of the parties, confirmed in writing.</p>

<p>Special Education Additional Authorizations</p>
<p>The parties recognize that state and federal agencies may make additional requirements for certification subsequent to a<br/>unit member's hire and placement in the field of special education. To assist with District compliance and unit member’s<br/>proper assignment, the District shall choose one or more of the following options to assist unit members in fulfilling their<br/>credential requirements:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contract with a credentiaiing institution to provide training and authorization</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reimburse unit members for coursework required for authorization</p>

<p>Reimbursement will occur upon proof of successful completion of coursework or exam. All receipts for registration, books,<br/>study guides, and other reimbursement costs shall be submitted with the Request for Funding Form.</p>
<p>Unit members who receive authorizations under 1 and 2 above, shall be required to serve as a special education teacher<br/>in the required assignment for a minimum of one school year subsequent to the acquisition of the authorization. Unit<br/>members who elect to transfer voluntarily prior to completing the one year requirement to an assignment not requiring the<br/>authorization, or, resign from the District, shall reimburse the District on a pro-rata basis for the cost of acquiring the<br/>authorization. If the member is involuntarily transferred or reassigned, this section shall not apply. In addition, the District<br/>may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Credit toward column advancement on the salary schedule is not available if the cost of the course/class is reimbursed to<br/>the unit member.</p>
<p>The district may offer enrollment in any classes to unit members whose assignments do not currently require the<br/>authorizations. Should the District choose to pay for or reimburse unit members for this coursework, the coursework shall<br/>not be credited towards column advancement on the salary schedule. Unit members who choose to pay for the<br/>coursework necessary shall receive credit for column advancement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding shall be in effect until June 30, 2016 and may be renewed only upon the mutual<br/>consent of both parties and as funding sources are available.</p>

<p>Tentative Agreement<br/>March 20,2014</p>
<p>The following agreements between the Fairfield-Suisun Unified Teachers Association (F-SUTA)<br/>and the Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District Governing Board (FSUSD) as outlined below<br/>pertain to the 2013-2014 school year unless otherwise noted. Hence, the following shall apply:</p>
<p>All terms and conditions in the collective bargaining agreement between F-SUTA and FSUSD<br/>remain unchanged except as stated below.</p>
<p>A. Compensation:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the F-SUTA salary schedules (Teachers Salary<br/>Schedule, Adult School Hourly Teacher Salary Schedule, Department Chairperson<br/>Salary Schedule, Extended Day Activity Salary Schedule and Permit Teachers Salary<br/>Schedule) by three (3) percent effective July 1, 2013. All unit members that were<br/>employed by the District during die 2013-14 school year will be eligible for this<br/>salary schedule increase.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to eliminate item number 4 on the Teachers Salary Schedule<br/>(Appendix A) that states “Salary Schedule includes one staff development day added<br/>to the work calendar for a total of 185 days effective 7-1-2000.” This agreement<br/>eliminates the mandatory Buy Back day cited in Article 20.2.3.a., leaves the pay for<br/>the day in the salary schedule, increasing the per diem rate for the remaining 184<br/>days, and leaves the two optional professional development days paid at the increased<br/>per diem rate (this equates to an approximate .54% - fifty'-four hundredths of a<br/>percent increase)</p>
<p>For the 2013-2014 school year, unit members that complete the mandatory Buy Back<br/>day shall be compensated at their per diem rate above and beyond the 184 day work<br/>calendar. In addition, per contract, unit members that complete the two (2) voluntary<br/>Buy Back days shall be compensated at their per diem rate. For the 2014-2015 school<br/>year, one additional Buy Back day will be paid for professional development related<br/>to Common Core State Standards. Thus, for the 2013-2014 and the 2014-2015 school<br/>years, unit members may earn up to three (3) days of pay, at their per diem rate, for<br/>participation in Buy Back.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the curriculum rate of pay (Article 19.9) from $29.30 per<br/>hour to the hourly rate calculated by taking the value of Step 1 Column 1 with<br/>credential of the Teachers Salary Schedule, dividing the annual pay' by 184 days and<br/>then by 7.25 hours per day effective the first pay period after F-SUTA ratification and<br/>FSUSD Governing Board approval.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the in-iieu rate of pay (Article 19,8.b.2 and 19.8.b.3)<br/>from $32.00 per hour to the hourly rate calculated by taking the value of Step 4<br/>Column 4 with credential of the Teachers Salary Schedule, dividing the annual pay by<br/>184 days and then by 7.25 hours per day effective the first pay period after F-SUTA<br/>ratification and FSUSD Governing Board approval.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the summer school/intervention rate of pay (Appendix<br/>F) from $32.01 per hour to the hourly rate calculated by taking the value of Step 4<br/>Column 4 with credential of the Teachers Salary Schedule, dividing the annual pay by<br/>184 days and then by 7.25 hours per day effective the first pay period after F-SUTA<br/>ratification and FSUSD Governing Board approval.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the home teaching rate of pay (Appendix H) from<br/>$29.02 per hour to the hourly rate calculated by taking the value of Step 4 Column 4<br/>with credential of the Teachers Salary Schedule, dividing the annual pay by 184 days<br/>and then by 7.25 hours per day effective the first pay period after F-SUTA ratification<br/>and FSUSD Governing Board approval.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the stipends for a Masters degree, Doctorate degree and<br/>the National Board Certification (Article 22.1.d and 22.1 .e) by three (3) percent<br/>effective July 1,2013. All Unit members that were employed by the District during<br/>the 2013-14 school year will be eligible for this salary schedule increase.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to increase the health and welfare benefit cap (Article 22.2) from<br/>$650 per month to $700 per month effective July 1, 2014.</p>

<p>This Memorandum of Understanding between the parties is entered into to address issues regarding preparation<br/>time for elementary unit members.</p>
<p>The parties agree that Article 19.4 - Preparation Time for elementary unit members is an important component<br/>of the elementary unit member’s workday. In addition, the parties agree that every effort is being made on the<br/>part of FSUSD to fund release time during the school day for the 2014-15 school year. FSUSD shall fund two<br/>(2) hours a month of preparation time each month.

<p>June 2, 2014</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the parties outlines an agreement to address our mutual<br/>interest in ensuring co-teaching at secondary sites is effective. The parties agree that beginning with the 2014-15<br/>school year the following procedures and supports will be implemented.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When making co-teaching assignments the site administrator will make reasonable efforts to pair general<br/>education and special education teachers who volunteer for co-teaching sections.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a teacher is assigned a co-teaching assignment involuntarily, they may appeal to the<br/>Executive Director of Pupil Services or designee within the first ten (10) days of their teaching assignment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An in-service day will be made available for co-teachers prior to the beginning of the school year. The day<br/>will consist of:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5-hour professional development which will qualify for &quot;buy-back credit&quot; and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.5 hours of common planning for co-teaching teams which will be compensated at the<br/>curriculum rate.</p>
<p>Teachers are encouraged to attend this with their co-teaching partner(s).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-Teaching teams will have an observation of their co-teaching practice each semester with written<br/>feedback to the team. This observation information shall not be used as a part of teacher evaluations.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When making co-teaching assignments the site administrator will make reasonable efforts to pair general<br/>education and special education with a common preparation period.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All co-teacher partnerships (per section, as appropriate) will be allowed up to 5 hours of time beyond the<br/>work day, paid at the curriculum rate, per semester for the purpose of having common planning with their<br/>co-teaching partner. Part of the 5 hours may be used for the purpose of collaboration on grading/grading<br/>practices. In the event that a co-teaching partnership is not scheduled with a common preparation<br/>period, they shall be allocated an additional 5 hours per semester beyond the work day, paid at the<br/>curriculum rate.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a co-teaching team finds that they need additional planning time than available in<br/>number 6 above, the co-teaching team may request additional time through the site administrator who<br/>will work with the special education department to provide support.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-Teaching Teams shall share the teacher of record function in AERIES. This will require co-teachers to<br/>have an additional AERIES account for each co-teach partnership.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2014-2015 school year only, formal observations, for the purpose of evaluation, shall occur only in<br/>sections where the evaluatee and evaluator mutually agree in writing to the observation.</p>
<p>This agreement shall not be considered precedential and shall not be viewed as status quo working conditions.</p>

<p>21.4 Special Education Learning Centers</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At year-round sites, the weighted instructional caseload will be recalculated<br/>each time a Learning Center teacher goes off-track. The on-track learning<br/>Center teacher will assume a weighted instructional caseload of up to 28 which<br/>includes students from the off-track Learning Center teacher’s weighted case<br/>management caseload. Should the teacher not volunteer to exceed the weighted<br/>instructional caseload limit, a substitute teacher will be provided to instruct the<br/>excess students from the off-track Learning Center teacher’s weighted case<br/>management caseload for those students’ Ml instructional program.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At year-round sites, the on-txack Learning Center teacher may volunteer to<br/>exceed the weighted instructional caseload limit of 28. Should a Learning<br/>Center teacher volunteer to exceed the weighted instructional caseload, one of<br/>the following support interventions will be implemented:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the weighted instructional caseload is between 29-32, with mutual<br/>agreement of the Learning Center staff and Special Education<br/>administrator, one of that site’s Learning Center instructional assistants<br/>hours will be increased to 25 hours per week or an additional<br/>instructional assistant will be provided for two hours for each day of the<br/>instructional program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the weighted instructional caseload is between 33-35, a one-half (1/2)<br/>day substitute teacher will be provided for each day of the instructional<br/>program.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the weighted instructional caseload exceeds 35, a substitute teacher<br/>shall be provided for the Ml instructional program.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this Article 21.4, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p>Weighted instructional caseload - The students, weighted as per 21.4.a., for<br/>whom a Learning Center teacher has the responsibility for implementing and<br/>supervising the instruction required by the students’ Individual Educational<br/>Plans. These students include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The on-track students on that Learning Center teacher’s weighted case<br/>management caseload.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When caseload limit allows, students without IEPs who receive<br/>temporary services from the Learning Center staff as per the site’s<br/>School Based Coordination Plan.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>3. At year-round sites, on-track students from an off-track Learning Center<br/>teacher’s weighted case management caseload.</p>
