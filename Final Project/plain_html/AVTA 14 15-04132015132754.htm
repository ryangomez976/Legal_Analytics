<p>ARTICLE VIII<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by the Association or by one or more<br/>teachers that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or<br/>misapplication of a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;aggrieved person&quot; is the person or persons, including the<br/>Association or representatives thereof, making the claim(s).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;party in interest&quot; is any person who might be required to take<br/>action or against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the<br/>claim.</p>
<p>II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may<br/>arise from time to time affecting the welfare or working conditions of<br/>teachers. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as<br/>informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>teacher having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any<br/>appropriate member of the administration, and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted without intervention by the Association, provided that the<br/>adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and<br/>the Association has been given an opportunity to be present at such<br/>adjustment and to state its views.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as<br/>possible, the time limits specified at each level should be considered to<br/>be maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the<br/>process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be<br/>processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end<br/>of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the<br/>following school year, could result in harm to the aggrieved person,<br/>the time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the procedure<br/>may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon as is<br/>practical.</p>
<p>9/05/13</p>
<p>III. Procedure</p>
<p>An aggrieved person will first discuss the possible grievance with the<br/>appropriate principal or immediate supervisor within a reasonable amount<br/>of time either directly or through the Association's designated Grievance<br/>Representative with the objective of resolving the matter informally.</p>
<p>'k</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved person and/or the Association is not</p>
<p>satisfied with the disposition of the informal meeting he/she may file<br/>the grievance in writing simultaneously with the President of the<br/>Association and the immediate supervisor. Within five (5) working<br/>days after receipt of the written grievance the immediate supervisor<br/>will meet with the aggrieved person and a representative of the<br/>Association or respond to the written grievance in writing. If no<br/>written decisiou is received within five (5) working days after<br/>presentation of the grievance OR the grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>disposition of the grievance, the grievance proceeds to Level Two.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ten&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working days at Level One, the</p>
<p>Superintendent or his/her designee will meet with the aggrieved<br/>person and a representative of the Association or respond to the<br/>grievance in writing. If no written decision is received within five (5)<br/>working days after presentation of the grievance OR the grievant<br/>and/or the Association is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance, the grievance proceeds to Level Three.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: If the grievant and/or the Association is not satisfied<br/>with the disposition of the grievance at Level Two, the grievance shall<br/>be referred to grievance mediation. The Association shall request that<br/>a mediator from the California State Mediation Service be assigned to<br/>assist the parties in the resolution of the grievance. If an agreement is<br/>reached, the agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall be signed<br/>by the grievant, the Association, and the District. In the event that the<br/>grievant, the Association and the Superintendent or his/her designee<br/>have not resolved the grievance within ten (10) working days of<br/>meeting with the mediator, the Association may terminate Level<br/>Three and proceed to Level Four. The Association and the District<br/>may waive Mediation by mutual agreement and proceed directly from<br/>Level Two to Level Four.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Four: The District and the Association agree that any grievance<br/>not settled at Level Three shall be submitted to arbitration under the<br/>provisions of the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American<br/>Arbitration Association (AAA) at the request of the Association. The<br/>filing shall be made within ten (10) working days of the final meeting <sup>13</sup></p>
<p>13</p>
<p>9/05/13</p>
<p>of mediation if not agreement is reached. The arbitrator’s decision<br/>shall be in writing and shall set forth the findings in fact, reasoning,<br/>and conclusions of the issues submitted. The arbitrator shall be<br/>without power or authority to make any decision that requires the<br/>commission of an act prohibited by law or which violates the terms of<br/>this Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is<br/>empowered to include any award or other remedies as she/he judges<br/>to be proper. The decision of the arbitrator shall be submitted to the<br/>Association and the District and will be final and binding upon the<br/>parties. All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not<br/>limited to, per diem expenses, travel and subsistence expenses, and the<br/>cost, if any, of a hearing room, shall be shared equally by the District<br/>and the Association. AH other costs, except for release time for the<br/>grievant(s), Association representative(s), and witnesses, shall be<br/>borne by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Teachers to Representation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by<br/>any member or representative of the administration or the Board<br/>against any aggrieved person, any party in interest, any member of<br/>the Association or any other participant in the grievance procedure by<br/>reason of such participation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure<br/>by himself or, at his /her option by a representative of his/her<br/>designation. The Association shall have the right to be present and to<br/>state its views at aU stages of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at Levels One and Two of the grievance procedure<br/>will be in writing setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore<br/>and will be transmitted promptly to all interested parties and the<br/>President of the Association. Time limits for appeal provided in each<br/>level shall begin the day following receipt of written decision by the<br/>parties in interest.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the<br/>Association to investigate a grievance or attend a grievance meeting or<br/>hearing during the day, he/she will, upon notice to the Superintendent<br/>by the President of the Association be released without loss of pay in<br/>order to permit participation in the foregoing activities. Any Teacher<br/>who is requested to appear in such investigations, meetings, or<br/>hearings, as a witness wiU be accorded the same right. <sup>14</sup></p>
<p>14</p>
<p>9/05/13</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the<br/>processing of a grievance by the Association will be filed in a separate<br/>grievance file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making<br/>reports and recommendations, and other necessary documents will be<br/>prepared jointly by the Superintendent and the Association so as to<br/>facilitate operation of the grievance procedure.

<p>I. Work Day</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teaching workday shall be scheduled between seven-forty (7:40)</p>
<p>A.M. and Three-twenty (3:20) P.M. The student day shall not begin<br/>prior to 8:10 a.m. or go beyond 2:50 p.m. on a regular school day.<br/>Kindergarten student day shall not go beyond 2:00 p.m. on a regular<br/>school day. Except for one (1) day a week, teachers shall be given at<br/>least thirty (30) minutes of individual preparation time. Teachers<br/>may sign out early on days in which they are enrolled in education<br/>classes, for medical purposes, or family leave with District approval.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may schedule a maximum of two (2) staff meetings a<br/>month that require teachers to remain for one (1) hour after the<br/>conclusion of the teaching workday (i.e. 4:20 p.m.).</p>

The<br/>parties further recognize that the demands of probationary teachers<br/>are even more intense so discretion should be used in seeking their<br/>voluntary participation on committees and other activities of a<br/>voluntary nature.</p>

Therefore, the District shall schedule these adjunct<br/>responsibilities as far in advance as possible, so that the teacher may<br/>plan his/her instructional preparation to accommodate such duties.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making adjunct duty assignments, the District shall seek volunteers<br/>prior to making assignments. Volunteer's time shall count along with<br/>assigned time in balancing out the adjunct duty responsibilities among<br/>the teachers.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In requiring teachers to perform adjunct duties, the District will<br/>divide said responsibilities in a reasonable manner among teachers.</p>

<p>1.4 Referred Permanent Teacher Peer Renew Program</p>
<p>1.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The purpose of this Program is to provide assistance and</p>
<p>renew quality teaching and offer remediation to permanent<br/>teachers whose performance has been evaluated as<br/>“unsatisfactory” in either subject matter knowledge, teaching<br/>strategics, teaching methods or instruction by evaluator. In<br/>addition, it shall be the obligation of the Panel to report the<br/>results of this intervention to the Board of Education of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>1.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program shall be limited to addressing those areas of<br/>performance set forth in the evaluation document listed as<br/>“unsatisfactory” encompassed in the areas of subject matter<br/>knowledge, teaching strategies, teaching methods or<br/>instruction.</p>
<p>1.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance provided by the peer assistant shall focus on the<br/>specific areas recommended for improvement by the<br/>participating teacher’s evaluator based upon the unsatisfactory<br/>rating or ratings in the performance evaluation that resulted in<br/>the referral to the PAR Program.</p>
<p>1.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance and remedial efforts and activities shall be intense<br/>and multifaceted, and shall be preceded by a conference in the<br/>spring of the year when the teacher receives the<br/>“unsatisfactory” evaluation. The conference shall involve the<br/>teacher being referred, the evaluator who evaluated the<br/>teacher, and assistant, to begin the development of an<br/>Individual Assistance Plan.

<p>1.4.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities for the teacher receiving assistance to<br/>observe exemplary practice, either by the peer assistant<br/>or other exemplary teachers:</p>
<p>1.4.6.4 District-provided &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professional development<br/>opportunities;</p>
<p>1.4.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference attendance, often in the company of the<br/>peer assistant, to facilitate reflection on how this<br/>experience fits into the Individual Assistance Plan;</p>
<p>1.4.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of assistance which the peer assistant and<br/>the Panel may provide; and</p>
<p>1.4.6.7The parties understand that every possible subject<br/>matter competency may not be available within the<br/>corps of assistants, and therefore, it shall occasionally<br/>be necessary to secure additional assistance to fully<br/>address identified deficiencies. In such cases, the peer<br/>assistant shall maintain prime responsibility for the<br/>Individual Assistance Plan, but may function more like<br/>a case carrier who assures the availability of<br/>appropriate resources.</p>
<p>1.4.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication and consultation between the evaluator,<br/>referred teacher and peer assistant shall be ongoing.</p>
<p>1.4.8 Nothing in this article precludes the evaluator or<br/>administrative staff from doing observations and evaluations<br/>nor from notifying the teacher verbally and/or in writing<br/>regarding incidents or events related to the teacher’s<br/>fulfillment of his or her professional obligations.</p>
<p>1.4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least three (3) written peer review reports will be submitted<br/>to the designated Panel by the peer assistant periodically as set<br/>forth by the Panel prior to February 15. The assistant will<br/>share all written and verbal evaluation reports during a</p>

<p>th</p>
<p>later than February 15 .

The final report shall become a part of the<br/>permanent teacher’s personnel file. The teacher shall have the<br/>opportunity to attach his or her comments.</p>
<p>1.4.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher and evaluator may be present for the<br/>assistant’s presentation and will be given an<br/>opportunity to respond to the report.</p>
<p>1.4.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel shall deliberate whether.</p>
<p>1.4.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher is now “proficient” in the areas evaluated,<br/>or</p>
<p>1.4.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panel and peer assistant do not consider that<br/>further assistance and remediation will be successful<br/>with reasons in support of this conclusion.</p>
<p>1.4.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the term of this assistance shall normally be for<br/>one school year, the assistance may be extended to a<br/>second year if the Panel believes progress is being made,<br/>although the permanent teacher may not have returned<br/>to a “proficient” level of performance.</p>
<p>1.4.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deliberations of the Panel shall be closed and confidential.<br/>Panel decisions shall be based on the information provided by<br/>the assistant, the evaluator, and the referred permanent<br/>teacher or his or her Association representative. The report of<br/>the vote shall only include the number of Panel members<br/>voting on each side of any question before the Panel.</p>
<p>1.4.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the teacher, his or her Association representative,<br/>assistant, nor evaluator may be present during deliberations of<br/>the Panel, which are confidential. The Panel may request<br/>additional information from any teacher involved in the PAR<br/>Program.</p>
<p>1.4.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Panel shall be reported to the teacher, the<br/>assistant, the evaluator, and the Association representative (if<br/>requested by the teacher) in conference with the<br/>Superintendent or designee.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon requesting donations under this program, the employee shall<br/>provide verification of the catastrophic injury or illness.
