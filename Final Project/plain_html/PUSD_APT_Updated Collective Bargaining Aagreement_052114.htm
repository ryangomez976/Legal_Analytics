<p>ARTICLE 4<br/>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>4.1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-12</p>
<p>4.1.1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is comprised of a team of certificated professionals working toward</p>
<p>the educational excellence of all students who attend the school. The principal,<br/>with the input of the bargaining unit members assigned to the school, determines<br/>the needs of the school. The principal shall determine the schedule and make<br/>necessary assignments of schedules and supervision duties which will ensure the<br/>safety of students attending the school. The duty day of all bargaining unit<br/>members shall include as much time as is necessary to fulfill professional duties<br/>to facilitate the educational program. Duties shall be assigned on an equitable<br/>basis. A regular classroom teacher in grades nine (9) to twelve (12) shall be<br/>assigned supervision duty only as provided in section 4.2.3. This provision<br/>(4.1.1) shall not apply to voluntary activities.</p>
<p>4.1.1.1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;portion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher work day assigned to in-classroom</p>
<p>student contact shall not exceed:</p>

<p>day consists of six (6) teaching periods and a daily preparation<br/>period. Preparation periods shall be of the same duration as a<br/>teaching period. For full-time teachers, periods shall be<br/>contiguous. This does not prevent a teacher from voluntarily<br/>teaching a discontinuous schedule. Each teaching period shall be<br/>sixteen point six-seven percent (16.67%) of an FTE (not greater<br/>than 1.0).</p>
<p>4.1.1.3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grades&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nine (9) through twelve (12), the teaching day consists of</p>
<p>five (5) teaching periods and a preparation period. Preparation<br/>periods shall be of the same duration as a teaching period. The<br/>preparation period is considered part of the teacher work day. For<br/>full-time teachers, periods shall be contiguous. This does not<br/>prevent a teacher from voluntarily teaching a discontinuous<br/>schedule.</p>

<p>discretion of the Board of Trustees. Requests shall be submitted in writing to the<br/>Human Resources Division giving specific dates and reasons. In general, the<br/>unit member’s principal or immediate supervisor shall recommend approval or<br/>disapproval of all leaves of absence prior to submission to the Human Resources<br/>Division. All requests shall be on appropriate forms.</p>
<p>6.1.2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No leave of absence approved by the Board of Trustees (by way of illustration</p>
<p>and not limitation, this includes sick leave [section 6.2], personal necessity<br/>[section 6.6], pregnancy disability leave [section 6.11.1], workers comp, child<br/>rearing [section 6.12], etc.) shall constitute an interruption in the continuity of<br/>service for the purpose of:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qualifying the unit member for permanent classification;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advancement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>Provided, however, the unit member must actually render service to the District<br/>on not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the teaching days of each school<br/>year in order to receive credit for the year.</p>

<p>be computed in determining the amount of service rendered.</p>
<p>6.1.2.2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solely for the purpose of advancement on the salary schedule, an</p>

<p>ARTICLE 13<br/>SPECIAL EDUCATION</p>
<p>13.1: This Article may be reopened by Association request to discuss the impact and<br/>implementation on unit member working conditions and other items in the scope of<br/>bargaining of new special education legislation passed after the adoption of the<br/>Agreement, and during the life of the Agreement.</p>
<p>13.2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide the equivalent of one (1) day per year of mutually agreed upon</p>
<p>release time for any general education classroom teacher who has a student designated in<br/>his/her current IEP as being in a Full Inclusion placement assigned to his/her class. This<br/>release time will be used for educational planning, collaboration with special education<br/>teachers to develop appropriate curriculum modifications/accommodations and other<br/>activities which relate to having this student in his or her classroom. This release time<br/>would be scheduled by the unit member with the approval of the site administrator.</p>
<p>13.3 Definitions</p>
<p>The parties recognize that Special Education definitions are not set by the District and are<br/>subject to change. However, in an attempt to advise unit members of special education<br/>student status that may affect them, the following definitions were appropriate in the<br/>2012/2013 school year.</p>
<p>13.3.1: Full Inclusion</p>
<p>A student with a moderate to severe disability who participates for the full<br/>school day in a general education classroom is considered to be in a full<br/>inclusion placement. The student is exposed to the general education<br/>curriculum and modifications and accommodations to this program are made in<br/>collaboration with special education staff. The student is not expected to meet<br/>all general education standards but rather meet goals established by the special<br/>education staff in collaboration with the general education teacher and other IEP<br/>team members. Social skill development can be a primary benefit to the<br/>student’s participation in a full inclusion placement rather than academic<br/>achievement.</p>
<p>13.3.2: Push In Services</p>
<p>Students with mild to moderate disabilities whose primary placement is in the<br/>general education program may receive some or all of their special education<br/>support through the special education teacher working with them in the general<br/>education setting (pushing into the general education setting). It is the District’s<br/>legal obligation to assure students are participating as much as possible in the</p>
<p>00013726 1<br/>05/21/2014</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>general education setting. This instruction would be designed by the special<br/>education teacher but could be implemented by an aide. Special education<br/>students’ time out of the general education is carefully monitored by the State<br/>Department of Education and stringent targets for general education<br/>participation of identified students are established for the District.</p>
<p>13.3.3: Pull Out Services</p>
<p>Students with mild to moderate disabilities whose primary placement is in the<br/>general education program may receive some or all of their special education<br/>support by leaving the general education program to receive special education<br/>instruction individually or in a small group with a special education teacher.<br/>These students are pulled out of their general education program to receive this<br/>special education instruction. Pull out services include specialized instruction<br/>by a special education teacher as well as designated instructional services such<br/>as speech, occupational therapy and adapted physical education.</p>
<p>13.3.4: Mainstreaming</p>
<p>All special education students are guaranteed access to general education<br/>participation to the maximum extent appropriate. For students who require<br/>special education instructional support for the majority of their school day<br/>(students in special day class placements), the District must define the amount<br/>of time they can successfully participate in general education. This<br/>“mainstreaming” back into the general education program allows the student<br/>access to the general education instruction as well as access to typically<br/>developing peers for ongoing development.</p>
<p>13.3.5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainstreaming</p>
<p>When a child is unable to participate in mainstreaming, an individual or small<br/>group of typically developing peers may participate in activities/instruction in<br/>the special education classroom.</p>
<p>13.4: Full Inclusion</p>
<p>See 13.3.1 above for a definition of Full Inclusion.</p>
<p>13.4.1: The District shall initially seek a volunteer from the affected site before<br/>assigning a full-inclusion student to a class roster.</p>
<p>13.4.2: A teacher who is assigned one (1) or more full-inclusion students shall be<br/>notified as early as possible regarding the enrollment of such a student in his/her<br/>class.</p>
<p>00013726.1</p>
<p>05/21/2014</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>13.4.3: Prior to the first day of attendance of a student previously identified by the<br/>District as a full-inclusion student, the teacher shall be informed of the student’s<br/>medical needs, receive a copy of the District’s medical emergency plan for that<br/>student and a copy of the student’s IEP. If the student is new to the District, all<br/>pertinent medical information and the IEP will be given to the teacher within<br/>five (5) days after the District receives the information from the former district.</p>
<p>13.4.4: The District shall provide the following to a teacher who has been assigned a<br/>full-inclusion student:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staff development;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate curricular and adaptive instructional materials and equipment;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support from a District specialist or resource teacher.</p>
<p>13.4.5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the District may offer the following to a teacher who has been</p>
<p>assigned a full-inclusion student:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use of a classroom aide;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra materials;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transition support through release time by both the former teacher and the<br/>full-inclusion teacher.</p>
<p>13.4.6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall count the full-inclusion student toward the class size of the</p>
<p>regular teacher to whom the student is assigned. Unless the teacher of the full-<br/>inclusion student agrees otherwise, his/her class roster shall be the last roster to<br/>reach maximum class size for that grade level at the school site.</p>

<p>23.1: In accordance with the principles of progressive discipline and just cause, the District<br/>shall have the right to suspend an employee without pay.</p>
<p>23.2: Progressive discipline means that the level of discipline should be tailored to fit the<br/>severity of the infraction.</p>
<p>23.2.1: By way of illustration and not limitation, the elements of progressive discipline<br/>include:</p>
<p>23.2.1.1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(verbal with a written confirmation). This shall not be</p>
<p>placed in the employee’s personnel file except in conjunction with<br/>the imposition of future discipline.</p>

<p>23.2.2: In appropriate circumstances:</p>
<p>23.2.2.1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infraction can result in the imposition of a higher level of</p>
<p>discipline without the need to be preceded by a lesser form of<br/>discipline.</p>
<p>23.2.2.2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee’s entire work history into</p>
<p>consideration (e.g., typically, the process will be repeated for each<br/>type of offense but common threads and patterns of behavior may<br/>negate this requirement).</p>
<p>23.2.3: Except in extraordinary circumstances, an employee shall have the opportunity<br/>to meet with the person imposing/recommending discipline prior to the time that<br/>a firm decision is reached.</p>
<p>23.3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disciplinary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause.</p>

<p>working days.</p>
<p>23.4.1: This shall not limit the District’s right to impose a suspension without pay of<br/>less than fifteen (15) working days.</p>
<p>23.4.2: Pay may not be withheld from a suspended employee until either the time limit<br/>for the filing of a grievance over the suspension ends without the employee<br/>filing a grievance, or the appropriateness of the suspension is upheld through the<br/>grievance process.</p>

<p>Article 7 of the District/APT collective bargaining agreement addresses employee-initiated transfers. To be<br/>considered, a permanent employee must first possess the required credentials for the position (and, in some cases,<br/>a CLAD/SB1969 certificate). Once you have determined that your credentials are in order, the following steps<br/>should be followed:</p>
<p>STEP 1 JANUARY: Administrators at each site will first meet with staff and make tentative assignments (the<br/>internal shuffle) for the coming year.</p>
<p>STEP 2 FEBRUARY 1: A list of potential openings will be compiled by the HR Division, with input from<br/>administrators, and will be available at school sites by February 1. This list will contain, at a minimum,<br/>all known vacancies due to retirements, resignations, and growth positions.</p>
<p>STEP 3 FEBRUARY 15: To be considered for an employee-initiated transfer, an employee must fill out the<br/>Request for Transfer form on the back side of this memo (the “Green” Form). The Form must be<br/>submitted to Human Resources no later than 4:30 p.m. on February 15<sup>th</sup>. The Form must reference a<br/>specific listed position. Only permanent employees are eligible for this process.</p>
<p>STEP 4 MARCH 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;submitted&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Green”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possesses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required</p>
<p>credentials/certificates for the identified position(s), will be contacted by the affected administrator(s) to<br/>schedule an interview for that position. Employees will be notified by March 1<sup>st</sup> regarding the<br/>administrator’s recommendation concerning their request for transfer.</p>
<p>STEP 5 MARCH 10: All continuing teachers (permanent and probationary), and temporaries to whom a job<br/>offer will be extended, will be advised of their tentative assignments for the coming year.</p>
<p>STEP 6 THEREAFTER: All remaining vacant positions will be posted and interested applicants from both<br/>inside and outside of the District may apply. All permanent District employees who possess the<br/>required credentials will be offered an interview. Competitive interviews will be held to determine the<br/>finalist for each position.</p>
<p>Please review Article 7 in the collective bargaining agreement to see the criteria used to make selections.<br/>There are two ways to voluntarily transfer or be reassigned: (1) The process described above, which results<br/>in first consideration for known vacancies; or (2) (in the alternative) an employee can apply for remaining<br/>vacant positions after being given an assignment for the coming year.</p>

<p>PRE-ASSISTANCE</p>
<p>PRE-ASSISTANCE</p>
<p>Pre-Assistance is considered to be a signal to the unit member that additional guidance and support is needed for maintaining Professional Standards<br/>in a particular domain(s). When Pre-Assistance is initiated by the supervising administrator, it is the responsibility of the administrator, along with<br/>the unit member:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To identify the specific problem in relation to the Professional Standards.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop and implement a plan for improvement within a period of ten (10) weeks.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gather selections to show evidence of improvement in the Professional Standards.</p>
<p>Throughout Pre-Assistance, the Administrator makes a commitment to the unit member to support the improvement plan and allow the necessary<br/>time for making adjustments. The early use of Pre-Assistance is viewed as positive support for a unit member who finds himself/herself with<br/>difficult challenges in his/her teaching or professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>When a unit member is placed on Pre-Assistance, no record of it shall be submitted to his or her certificated personnel file. Only when a unit<br/>member is placed on Assistance is a record submitted to his/her personnel file. The period of Pre-Assistance is ten (10) weeks.</p>
<p>Set forth below are the components of the Pre-Assistance Plan:</p>
<p>The supervising administrator will give a written notice to the unit member regarding:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement of the problem in relation to the Professional Standards:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement of the desired outcome in relation to the Professional Standards:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date(s) that the problem has occurred;</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date when the problem is to be resolved; and</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendations and assistance that will be given to the unit member.</p>
<p>After the written notification is given to the unit member, follow-up observations and conferences between the unit member and the evaluator will<br/>take place. The conferences will result in one of the following actions:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue observations and conferences.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement on Assistance.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the problem is resolved, and Professional Standards are met, the unit member will return to the current evaluation option<br/>and timeline.</p>
<p>ASSISTANCE</p>
