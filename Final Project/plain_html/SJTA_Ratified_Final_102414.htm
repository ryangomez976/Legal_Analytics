Only units earned after the receipt of the Bachelor’s Degree shall be used in the<br/>initial salary placement. Graduate course work credits taken during attainment of a<br/>Bachelor’s Degree earned by unit members hired after July 1, 2006, as part of a<br/>comprehensive, accredited credentialing program shall also be considered in initial salary<br/>placement. The Personnel Department will validate that the graduate course credits are<br/>appropriate for salary placement prior to initial salary placement. Credits earned must be<br/>directly related to the unit member’s assignment, credential (s), advanced education degree<br/>or educational professional growth.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>6.1.11 Effective August 15, 2008, all new non-credentialed, emergency credentialed, and<br/>internship certificated unit members, including waivers, provision intern permits, short term<br/>staffing permits, and limited assignments, will be placed on column 1, step 1 of the<br/>appropriate certificated salary schedule (teacher, psychologist, counselor, nurse or speech<br/>therapist). These unit members will not move forward on step or column of the salary<br/>schedule until they receive a valid preliminary or clear credential. All current interns and<br/>non-credentialed unit members, as described above, employed by the District as of July 1,<br/>2008, shall be y-rated at their present column and step. Y-rating means that the unit<br/>member will not progress on the salary schedule until the member meets specified<br/>requirements. The specified requirement is the receipt of his or her preliminary or clear<br/>credential specific to the area in which he or she teaches. Once the unit member has<br/>received a preliminary or clear credential, they will be eligible to advance to the appropriate<br/>column of the salary schedule, in compliance with the deadlines set forth in the SJTA<br/>Collective Bargaining Agreement, Article 6.8. The unit member is also eligible to advance<br/>a maximum of one step on the salary schedule in July following the member's receipt of a<br/>preliminary or clear credential, regardless of the number of years the unit member was y-<br/>rated or frozen on the salary schedule.</p>

One minimum day for grade<br/>preparation per grading period will be designated at the secondary sites with the exception of the<br/>continuation school(s).</p>
<p>7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that evening parent conferences are scheduled by the administration, staff will be<br/>allowed to leave at the end of the student day during such conference periods. The staff is expected<br/>to perform an equivalent amount of service at evening conferences with parents.</p>
<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-service days will be divided 1/2 teacher preparation and 1/2 District/site needs. The District<br/>will ensure that teacher preparation will be in a minimum of two hour blocks.</p>
<p>7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated staff will be relieved of after-school duty. Under special circumstances, unit members<br/>may be assigned student supervision to ensure student/stafif safety or to facilitate handling of an<br/>emergency.</p>
<p>7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 10 school days of the Board decision to implement a year round education plan at a specific<br/>school site, a meeting will be held with staff at the site impacted by the change.</p>
<p>7.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 10 school days after the initial meeting with the affected staff, they will be given<br/>opportunity to state their preferences for the following year's assignment on a survey. The<br/>District will make every effort to honor voluntary transfer requests. When two or more unit<br/>members apply for a year round assignment, the following shall be considered: a unit<br/>member's area of competence, major or minor field of study/credential area, experience,<br/>and the best interests of the District, which may include seniority.</p>
<p>7.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members wanting to transfer out of a school participating in a year round education<br/>program shall follow the procedures in Article XIII, but such employees shall be given first<br/>consideration for vacancies. Any unit member who is unable to be accommodated by<br/>voluntary transfer procedure the first year will be considered for voluntary transfer the<br/>following year by following the procedures in Article XIII.</p>
<p>7.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association will agree on a calendar for year round education.</p>
<p>7.12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children of unit members teaching in year round education programs shall be given<br/>preference in being scheduled on the same track as parent(s).</p>
<p>7.12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members married to other unit members in the District shall not be involuntarily<br/>assigned to different year round tracks.</p>
<p>7.12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may request unit members to work additional days beyond their regular work<br/>year. Unit members who agree to provide service during their non-service days other than<br/>classroom substitution shall be paid on a per diem basis. During negotiating sessions with<br/>the District unit members shall be paid their hourly rate if such meetings are held during<br/>their non-service days. Unit members who are asked and agree to work these regular non¬<br/>service days shall be credited with one additional illness leave day for each 19 additional<br/>days actually worked during a 12-month school year.</p>
<p>7.12.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who substitute during non-service days shall be compensated at the rate of<br/>$150 per day.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>7.12.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on non-service days will be given first consideration to substitute if they<br/>have notified the District that they are available to substitute.</p>
<p>7.12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portable secure storage cabinets and reasonable custodial assistance shall be provided in<br/>moving materials of unit members when they are required to go to another room at the<br/>beginning and end of a teaching track.</p>
<p>7.12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If qualified personnel are available and it is programmatically feasible, the District shall<br/>attempt to distribute students with special needs across more than one track.</p>
<p>7.12.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At year round schools, report cards shall be issued to students two (2) times a year.</p>
<p>7.12.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members assigned to the year round education program shall be provided with a<br/>reasonable opportunity to serve as support providers, consulting teachers, participate on<br/>District committees, attend professional growth conferences, etc. By mutual agreement<br/>between the District and the unit member, additional compensation may be provided at the<br/>summer school rate when the unit member participates in District activities (e.g. District<br/>curriculum workshops) during their non-workdays.</p>
<p>7.12.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student instructional day and the unit member workday may vary from those in the<br/>traditional program of the District. The District may take any action to ensure compliance<br/>with all incentive provisions in Education Code Sections 46200-46204 concerning days of<br/>instruction for students and amounts of minimum instructional minutes.</p>
<p>7.12.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional non-workdays such as state, federal and District holidays will remain the same<br/>as non-workdays on the regular calendar. The calendar of workdays will be adjusted<br/>accordingly.</p>
<p>7.12.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One school day shall be scheduled immediately preceding the opening of three instructional<br/>sessions for unit members to have access to materials, workrooms, classrooms and<br/>restrooms during normal work hours. Unit members with four session openings during the<br/>school year will have three pre-service days for classroom preparation and one day for<br/>parent conferences unless that day is exchanged for a fourth pre-service day. This<br/>exchange requires the approval of the site administrator. These days shall be part of the<br/>unit members' normal 184 day contract year. Access to classrooms will be arranged by<br/>mutual consent of staff.</p>
<p>7.12.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal or designee will provide unit members with their tentative school, class,<br/>track, and room assignment for the succeeding school year between April 1-15.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII: EXTRA-DUTY STIPENDS</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies in extra-duty stipend positions will be advertised within the District by posting at the<br/>designated area(s) at appropriate site(s). Vacancy notices shall include posting dates, application<br/>deadlines and designated administrator. All extra-duty stipend positions will be advertised<br/>internally before being advertised outside the District. If the administrator determines there are no<br/>qualified applicants for the position within the District, the District may open the position to outside<br/>applicants.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All applicants will complete an application form which will be available at each site. An interview<br/>process shall occur for all eligible applicants for a position, and the most qualified shall be given<br/>preference for selection. If no applicant is determined to be qualified, the position may be re-flown. <sup>11</sup></p>
<p>11</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multiple applicants, if mutually agreeable, may split a stipend position with the administrator's<br/>approval. The percentage of the split and the responsibilities assigned to each applicant must be<br/>approved in advance by the administrator. A summary of job responsibilities will be available at all</p>
<p>sites.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term of Stipend Positions</p>
<p>8.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.J.H.S.: Subject to Board approval, upon the annual completion of an extra duty stipend<br/>position, a unit member receiving a satisfactory evaluation may continue in that position,<br/>by indicating such on the evaluation form. After completion of three consecutive years in a<br/>position by the same person, the position will become vacant and will be re-flown. The<br/>incumbent has the option to reapply for the position.</p>
<p>8.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Other Sites: All extra duty stipend positions will be assigned for one year only. The<br/>incumbent has the option to reapply for the position.</p>
<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of each extra-duty stipend assignment, evaluation by the stipend supervisor will take<br/>place according to the following timelines:</p>
<p>8.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All coaches will be evaluated within 20 days following the end of their season, or for spring<br/>sports, by the last day of the school year.</p>
<p>8.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletic Director, Activities Director, Academic Coach, and Department Heads will be<br/>evaluated by April 15th.</p>
<p>8.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other extra-duty stipend assignments will be evaluated by the end of the school year at<br/>the site where the assignment takes place.</p>
<p>8.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluations generated prior to the completion of the stipend responsibilities may require a<br/>re-evaluation, if there is a change in performance.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrator's decision regarding an applicant's qualifications, the final selection, and<br/>subsequent evaluation will not be subject to the Grievance Procedures. However, all personnel<br/>selections are subject to Board approval.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administrator may realign site stipend positions to meet changing needs and circumstances<br/>providing the following criteria have been met:</p>
<p>8.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stipend percentages for specific listed positions shall not be changed;</p>
<p>8.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the realignment remains within the annual amount budgeted for stipends at that site (subject<br/>to #5);</p>
<p>8.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the realignment is site specific;</p>
<p>8.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an additional position already on the Master Stipend Position List becomes available<br/>through realignment, it must be flown;</p>
<p>8.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any site realignment must have prior approval of the Superintendent/designee.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>The creation of a position not on the Master Stipend Position List is not a realignment and therefore<br/>shall be negotiated. A substantive change in job responsibilities or length of assignment shall be<br/>negotiated.</p>
<p>8.8 All extra-duty stipend positions will be reviewed annually by the Superintendent/designee. The<br/>Superintendent/designee will determine the need for positions based on current needs and<br/>availability of funds. The following assignments have been identified as extra-duty stipend<br/>positions. Authorized positions will be filled on a voluntary basis.</p>

If the report<br/>concludes that the absence is not due to personal illness or injury, or that the illness is not<br/>sufficiently severe to warrant continued absence, then the Superintendent or designee, after<br/>notice to the unit member, may refuse to grant such leave. If requested by the District<br/>management, a unit member shall not return to work until he submits a medical doctor's<br/>authorization to return to work.

<p>12.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall be notified of the accumulated leave by no later than October 15 of<br/>each school year.</p>
<p>12.2 Personal Necessity Leave</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVIII: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this process is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, swift and<br/>equitable resolutions of grievances and the maintenance of a positive labor-management<br/>relationship. The Association and District agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the process.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>18.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a written allegation by a grievant that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of a specific provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>18.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; may be the Association or a unit member covered by the specific provisions of<br/>this Agreement. The grievant will be identified on the Dispute Resolution Form.</p>
<p>18.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day which the central administration office of the District is open for<br/>business.</p>
<p>18.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having jurisdiction over the<br/>disputed issue.</p>
<p>18.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computation of time&quot; shall begin on the &quot;day&quot; following the act, omission or practice<br/>giving rise to the grievance.</p>

<p>18.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant and immediate supervisor must be present at all levels of the processing of a<br/>grievance.

The District may be represented by any person or agent<br/>designated by them to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>18.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance shall not be valid for consideration unless it is submitted in writing, on the<br/>prescribed form, to the immediate supervisor setting forth the facts and specific</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>provision(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated and the particular relief sought. The<br/>written grievance must be submitted within thirty (30) days from the date of the most recent<br/>act, omission or practice giving rise to the grievance. Failure to file any grievance within<br/>such time period shall be deemed a waiver thereof.</p>
<p>18.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision rendered at any level in these procedures becomes final, unless appealed within<br/>the time period specified.</p>
<p>18.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the District or its representative(s) to render a decision within the time periods<br/>specified herein shall constitute a denial of the grievance and the grievant may appeal to the<br/>next level.</p>
<p>18.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time periods given in these procedures may be modified by written agreement between the<br/>Association and the District.</p>

This provision may be waived<br/>by written agreement between the Association and the District.</p>
<p>18.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member may present grievances in accordance with this Article without<br/>intervention of the Association. However, the proposed resolution of the grievance shall<br/>not be final until the Association has been provided a copy of such resolution and been<br/>given ten (10) days to either accept it or appeal it to the next level.</p>
<p>18.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member's grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the District to proceed<br/>in carrying out its management responsibilities. Unit members shall carry out all<br/>management directives pending the final resolution of a grievance.</p>
<p>18.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents resulting from the processing of a grievance shall be kept in a separate<br/>grievance resolution file and shall not be kept in a unit member's personnel file.

A grievance challenging the<br/>Board's actions under this paragraph shall be filed in writing with the Superintendent and shall be<br/>commenced at Level III under paragraph 17.4.3.</p>
