<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make a reasonable effort to maintain safe and healthy<br/>working conditions so that teachers shall not be required to perform tasks<br/>that endanger their health, safety or well-being.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are required to report to the Administrator in writing conditions<br/>which they feel are hazardous or unsafe.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEXUAL HARRASSMENT POLICY</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harassment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is as defined in the Education Code and applicable</p>
<p>non-discrimination law. Education Code Section 212.5 defines sexual<br/>harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual<br/>favors, and other verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual<br/>nature, made by someone from or in the workplace or educational<br/>setting, under any of the following conditions:</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submission to the conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or a<br/>condition of an individual's employment, academic status, or<br/>progress.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submission&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used</p>
<p>as the basis of employment or academic decisions affecting the<br/>individual.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact<br/>upon the individual's work or academic performance, or of creating<br/>an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or educational<br/>environment.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submission&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to, or rejection of, the conduct by the individual is used</p>
<p>as the basis for any decision affecting the individual regarding<br/>benefits and services, honors, programs, or activities available at or<br/>through the educational institution.</p>
<p>(NOTE: Education Code Section 48900.2 states: For the purposes of<br/>this chapter, the conduct described in Section 212.5 must be<br/>considered by a reasonable person of the same gender as the victim<br/>to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to have a negative impact upon<br/>the individual's academic performance or to create an intimidating,<br/>hostile, or offensive educational environment.)</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harassment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verbal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(such&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person's</p>
<p>clothing or sex life, sexual jokes and innuendoes, repeated requests<br/>for dates, suggestive comments &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or sounds,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or sexual</p>
<p>propositions), physical (such as hugging, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touching,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impeding</p>
<p>movement, rubbing up against someone or suggestive gestures), or<br/>visual (such as pictures, cartoons, or sexually suggestive objects).</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are prohibited from engaging in sexual harassment. This</p>
<p>prohibition applies to all employees, including supervisory and<br/>management personnel. The District shall prohibit sexual harassment<br/>of unit members. The timelines for the regular grievance procedure<br/>are tolled if a unit member chooses to pursue a complaint through<br/>the sexual harassment complaint procedure established by the<br/>District under Education Code Sections 212.5 and 212.6. All sexual<br/>harassment investigations and all discipline imposed pursuant to the<br/>District's sexual harassment policy shall be subject to the relevant<br/>provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaint&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timelines for the regular grievance procedure are tolled</p>
<p>if a unit member chooses to pursue a complaint through any<br/>internal complaint procedure the District has for dealing<br/>with complaints of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complainant, the accused, and employees interviewed</p>
<p>about the complaint have a right to union representation<br/>during all meetings with management regarding the<br/>complaint. Management will inform all affected employees<br/>of this right and allow them sufficient time to secure union<br/>representation prior to being interviewed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;management persons (one man and one woman) shall</p>
<p>be specially designated for receipt of sexual harassment<br/>complaints. These individuals will be trained in dealing with</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>complaints of sexual harassment. All employees shall be<br/>informed of the persons designated to receive complaints.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will train its own staff to investigate and resolve</p>
<p>complaints of sexual harassment rather than hire outside<br/>individuals to perform these services. Training shall ensure<br/>that thorough and fair investigations will be made of sexual<br/>harassment complaints.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harassment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complaints shall be in writing and shall</p>
<p>include descriptions of the conduct complained of (including<br/>date, time, location, etc.), and the names of the<br/>complainant and any witnesses. The complainant shall be<br/>allowed to request a particular remedy in the complaint.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is filed, the District shall inform the</p>
<p>complainant of her/his right to file a discrimination<br/>complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and<br/>Housing and/or the Equal Employment Opportunity<br/>Commission, and the procedures for filing.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accused&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given a copy of the written complaint.</p>
<p>Otherwise, information regarding the complaint shall not be<br/>disclosed to anyone, except as necessary to conduct the<br/>investigation and to resolve the complaint.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engage in a prompt, thorough, and</p>
<p>impartial investigation of the complaint. The accused shall<br/>be given the opportunity to consult with a representative in<br/>advance of any investigatory interview and given adequate<br/>opportunity to respond to each allegation. Investigations<br/>shall be limited to interviews with individuals who<br/>reasonably might be considered to have information<br/>relevant to the specific allegations in the complaint. All unit<br/>members, including the complainant, and the accused, shall<br/>be given release time to participate in the investigation.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inform&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the complainant and the accused in</p>
<p>writing of the results of the investigation, including an<br/>analysis of relevant evidence with respect to each allegation<br/>in the complaint and a specific finding as to whether sexual<br/>harassment did or did not occur with respect to each<br/>allegation in the complaint.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint is found valid, the District shall take prompt<br/>corrective action, reasonably calculated to end the<br/>harassment. Prior to taking such action, the district shall<br/>provide notice of the proposed action to the complainant,</p>
<p>the accused and the Association, and shall allow five (5)<br/>work days for a response. Any discipline imposed on a unit<br/>member under this section shall be consistent with<br/>principles of just cause and progressive discipline. The<br/>District shall inform the complainant in writing of the action<br/>taken, if any, to ensure that the problem is corrected.<br/>Otherwise, all information regarding any proposed or actual<br/>disciplinary action shall be kept confidential by the District.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint is withdrawn or found invalid, the<br/>complaint or the investigation shall not be referred to in<br/>either the complainant's and/or accused personnel file or<br/>used for any purpose.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no retaliation against any individual for filing<br/>or providing information regarding a sexual harassment<br/>complaint.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that not all allegations of sexual<br/>harassment of pupils constitute reportable child abuse and<br/>shall exercise reasonable care in distinguishing between the<br/>two.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide an educational session for all staff<br/>on the subject of sexual harassment, including, among other<br/>things, recognizing sexual harassment, responding to<br/>harassment, documenting harassment, and legal rights. This<br/>session shall be provided once a year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harassment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be</p>
<p>posted and provided to all employees at the start of each<br/>school year and to each employee hired mid-year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provision shall not be construed to limit any other unit</p>
<p>member rights</p>
<p>B. Occupational Exposure to Blood-Borne Pathogens</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to establish standards of protection from blood-borne<br/>pathogens for employees who may reasonable anticipate coming into<br/>contact with human blood and other potentially infections materials in the<br/>course of performing their assigned duties.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to establish a written exposure control plan for<br/>employees regarding occupational exposure to blood and other potentially<br/>infectious materials. The control plan shall include the following provisions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall publish and post health and safety rules at all work<br/>sites to reduce the risk of contamination.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall establish a method for keeping records of exposure<br/>incidents, post-exposure follow-up, hepatitis B vaccinations, and<br/>employee training.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall determine if the health plan covering employees provides<br/>Hepatitis B vaccination without cost to the employee. If so, the employer<br/>shall inform employees how to obtain vaccinations under the plan. In the<br/>event the plan does not provide for vaccinations, the employees with<br/>occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens shall be provided the<br/>following at employer expense:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary Hepatitis B Vaccination Series</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who choose not to accept the vaccine must sign a<br/>declination form.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who decline the vaccine may elect to be<br/>vaccinated at a later date.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical follow-up and appropriate counseling if an exposure incident<br/>occurs.</p>

<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of Award ($500,000)</p>
<p>Number of FTE unit members (20.6) = $24,271.84 each</p>
<p>Unit members working at the school/site on a part-time basis shall<br/>receive an amount equal to full-time award multiplied by the<br/>percentage of time worked at the school/site.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay Option 2: Full time unit members shall be paid an amount that is equal<br/>to a percentage of their base salary that is determined by dividing the total<br/>amount awarded to the school/site by the sum of the annual base salaries<br/>for unit members at the school/site.</p>
<p>Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount of Award ($500,000)</p>
<p>Sum of annual base salaries ($800,000) = 0.625</p>
<p>Unit member A's salary = $42,000 x 0.625 = $26,250 award<br/>Unit member B's salary = $32,000 x 0.625 = $20,000 award</p>

<p>ARTICLE X CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parties agree that small class sizes benefit student learning and shall endeavor<br/>to keep class sizes as small as the financial circumstances of the district permit.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall attempt to maintain all classroom enrollments at a maximum of<br/>twenty-four (24) students per classroom subject to the financial condition of the<br/>district and the best interest of the students.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any individual classroom enrollment exceeds twenty four (24) students<br/>the district shall post an opening for a classroom aid within five (5) duty days.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any individual classroom enrollment exceeds twenty four (24) students,<br/>aide time shall be provided for the entire math or language block within seven (7)<br/>duty days of the placement of the 25th student.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any individual classroom exceeds 26 students, an aide shall be provided<br/>in addition to that stated in section &quot;C&quot; above for both the entire math and<br/>language blocks within seven (7) duty days of the placement o the 27th student.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aide time in sections &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; shall be provided during the entire math and<br/>language blocks, Monday through Thursday. In the event that an aide is not<br/>available to provide the additional support time stated in Sections &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;,<br/>Compensation shall be provided to the classroom teacher until the aide time is<br/>provided using the following formula:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divide the teacher's current annual salary by 180 student days, to get the<br/>daily rate of pay.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, divide the daily rate by 24 (contracted number of students per class)<br/>to get a per pupil daily dollar amount.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the per pupil daily dollar amount and divide it by two (2) to determine<br/>the additional daily pay the teacher will get for each day their class's student<br/>enrollment is above 24 students without the help of an aide.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To document this and to receive compensation, the teacher will add an hour<br/>to their monthly timesheet. The column shall be titled &quot;extra students&quot;.<br/>Teachers will then write the number of students over 24 that are enrolled<br/>each day (absences do not need to be monitored, only enrollment numbers).</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever any class shall have an enrollment of more than twenty eight (28)<br/>students, the parties shall meet within five (5) days to arrive at a mutually<br/>satisfactory way to address the issue. Such agreement may include but is not limited</p>
<p>to: additional compensation, planning time, reduction in adjunct duties or any<br/>other such accommodations as may be mutually agreeable between the parties.</p>
<p>See Ed Code Sections 52120 - 52128.5</p>

However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is empowered to<br/>include in any award such financial reimbursement or other remedies as<br/>she/he judges to be proper. The decision of the arbitrator shall be submitted<br/>to the Association and the District and will be final and binding upon the<br/>parties.

<p>35</p>
<p>questions will be ruled by the arbitrator only after she/he has had an<br/>opportunity to hear the merits of the grievance.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A decision rendered at any step in these procedures becomes final and<br/>binding upon all parties unless appealed within the time specified. If a<br/>decision is not given within the time limit, an appeal may be taken directly to<br/>the next level. Failure to appeal a decision within the specified time limits<br/>shall be deemed an acceptance of the decision.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits for appeal provided in each level shall begin the day following<br/>receipt of the written decision, or the day following the time limit for<br/>rendering a decision at that level.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the<br/>number of days indicated at each level is considered a maximum, and every<br/>effort should be made to expedite the process.
