<p>15.1 District-wide staffing ratios:</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, the State of California enacted the Local Control<br/>Funding Formula (“LCFF”) which has a stated goal of providing additional funds to serve the<br/>students of the State of California.</p>
<p>Upon full implementation of the LCFF, as a condition of die receipt of an additional adjustment<br/>to the kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive base grant (“additional Class Size Reduction<br/>(CSR) adjustment grant”), all school districts shall maintain an average class enrollment for each<br/>school site for kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive, of not more than 24 pupils, unless a<br/>“collectively bargained alternative ratio” is agreed to by the school district. (Education Code<br/>section 42238.02(d)(3)(D)).</p>
<p>Beginning witii the 2013-14 school year and continuing until section 42238.03(b)(4) is effective<br/>upon full implementation of tire LCFF, as a condition of die receipt of die additional CSR<br/>adjustment grant, school districts witii class size averages of more tiian 24 students will need to<br/>make progress towards maintaining an average class enrollment of not more than 24 pupils in<br/>kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive per school site pursuant to the calculations outlined in<br/>42238.02(d)(3)(B), unless a “collectively bargained alternative annual average class enrollment”<br/>for each school site in tiiose grades is agreed to by the school district.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on die recitals above MHFT and die District agree to die following district wide<br/>staffing ratios of teacher to pupils:</p>
<p>Grades K-3</p>
<p>Grades 4-6<br/>Grades 7-8<br/>Grades 9-12</p>
<p>Continuation High School</p>
<p>The average class enrollment for each school site for kindergarten<br/>and grades 1 to 3, inclusive, may be up to 29 pupils. However, no<br/>individual class will have more than 32 students. It is the intent of<br/>the Parties that this language addresses any and all obligations of the<br/>parties to have “a collectively bargained alternative ratio” and<br/>includes the parties’ agreement on tiiese issues as required to<br/>preserve the additional CSR adjustment grant, as currently stated in<br/>the LCFF provisions, including Education Code section 42238.02<br/>1 teacher per 29 pupils<br/>1 teacher per 29 pupils (with a 6 period day)</p>
<p>1 teacher per 29 pupils (with a 6 period day)</p>
<p>1 teacher per 27 pupils</p>
<p>Grades 7-8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 teacher per 23 pupils (with 7 period&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day)</p>
<p>Grades 9-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 teacher per 23 pupils (with 7 period&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day)</p>

At<br/>the K-6 level, the actual ratio of teachers to pupils at each grade span will be listed. In<br/>classes bridging grade spans, the students in the higher student-teacher ratio grade span<br/>shall be counted for purpose of this article (15.1) in the lower student-teacher ratio span.</p>
<p>15.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall attempt to limit enrollment in the following manner:</p>
<p>15.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In K-6 classes so that a maximum of thirty-two (32) is not exceeded,</p>

<p>15.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 7-12 Physical Education classes so that a maximum of 50 is not exceeded. In the 2014-<br/>2015 school year, the class size maximum in 7-12 Physical Education will be at 50<br/>students wherever possible.

<p>15.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music sections are exempted from these maximums.</p>
<p>15.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall attempt to limit enrollment in the preschool - 6<sup>th</sup> grade Special Day<br/>Classes to a maximum of 12 students. If a placement into a class would exceed the<br/>maximum of 12, all possible receiving teachers will meet with the Special Services<br/>administrator or designee to determine the best placement for the incoming student.</p>
<p>15.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-6 maximums and 7-12 maximums may be exceeded with mutual consent of teachers and<br/>principal.</p>
<p>15.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District or Federation representatives may request a meeting at a mutually agreed time during the<br/>first fifteen (15) days of instruction to review staffing ratios and class sizes.</p>
<p>The District will adjust staffing as necessary to comply with Article 15.1 by the twenty first<br/>(21st) day of instruction. In the event that unit member’s pupil load exceeds the above<br/>maximums (Section 15.2) for each of the first twenty (20) days of the school year or for a period<br/>of ten (10) consecutive school days thereafter, the District will either reduce the number of<br/>students assigned so as to comply with the maximum or provide compensation as outlined in<br/>Article 15.5 (elementary) and Article 15.6 (secondary).</p>
<p>15.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the district-wide ratio is exceeded, for each 29th student above the ratio the<br/>District and the Federation will come to mutual agreement to add a teacher(s) or distribute<br/>stipends that equate to die cost of the teacher(s).</p>
<p>The District shall attempt to limit enrollment in the following manner in K-6 classes so that a<br/>maximum of thirty-two (32) is not exceeded. Teachers exceeding the 32 student maximum will<br/>be eligible for compensation the 21st day after the start of die school year and compensation will<br/>be retroactive to the date of enrollment.

<p>16.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation is the process the District uses through its evaluators to assess the performance of unit<br/>members based upon job description, provisions of this contract, evaluation criteria, applicable<br/>District policies and regulations, applicable county, state and federal laws and regulations,<br/>adopted course outlines, learner goals and other duties and responsibilities as assigned.</p>
<p>The Morgan Hill Unified School District’s evaluation process can be conducted through one of<br/>three methods: Administrative Evaluation, Peer-based Evaluation, or Project-based Evaluation,<br/>each based on professional standards.</p>
<p>The standards as described in the Evaluation Handbook for Certificated Staff act as a guide for<br/>discussion regarding professional growth and serve as a basis for unit member evaluation. Each<br/>certificated unit member is responsible for meeting the unit member’s professional standards as<br/>described in the Evaluation Handbook for Certificated Staff to show growth in the unit member’s<br/>practice as an educator. Administrators have die right and responsibility to observe certificated<br/>unit members in their work setting at any time. In a post-observation conference, administrators<br/>have the right and responsibility to identify any concerns related to meeting the standards that<br/>surfaced during an observation in the work setting.</p>
<p>16.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Evaluation Methods</p>
<p>There are three methods for certificated unit member evaluation. Each method uses self-<br/>assessment and reflection and is linked to die appropriate standards continuum for the<br/>credentialed unit member’s position or assignment. Continuums are available for classroom<br/>teacher, librarian, counselor, and nurse; addendum available for Teacher on Special Assignment.</p>
<p>Administrative Evaluation: This is an optional method for permanent unit members who have<br/>met or exceeded standards in their previous overall evaluation rating. Administrative Evaluation<br/>is the required method for probationaiy unit members and temporary unit members. It is also a<br/>required method for permanent unit members who have not met or who have partially met<br/>standards in their previous overall evaluation rating.</p>
<p>Peer-based Evaluation: With administrative approval, this is a recommended option for<br/>permanent unit members who have met or exceeded standards in their previous overall evaluation<br/>rating and would like to work with a peer in order for each peer/partner to examine practices and<br/>demonstrate proficiency.</p>
<p>Project-based Evaluation: With administrative approval, this is another recommended option for<br/>permanent unit members who have met or exceeded standards in their previous overall evaluation<br/>rating and would like to demonstrate proficiency via a professional project related to their current<br/>practices.</p>
<p>16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluators are those administrators designated by the District to evaluate unit members. By<br/>September 1, each evaluatee shall be notified of the evaluator assigned to the unit member; and<br/>given access to die Evaluation Handbook for Certificated Staff.</p>
<p>16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary evaluations shall reflect progress and performance in the areas of die professional<br/>standards. Administrators and all unit members are responsible for meeting professional</p>
<p>standards at all times. As administrators observe formally or informally in classrooms or work<br/>settings, they also have die right and responsibility to identify any concerns related to meeting<br/>the standards. Administrators have the right and responsibility to observe unit members at any<br/>time. Participation and performance of professional duties outside the classroom setting, such as<br/>attending meetings, are included in the evaluation process and will be documented.</p>
<p>16.5 Administrative Evaluation Method</p>
<p>A permanent unit member who meets or exceeds standards in the previous overall evaluation<br/>rating may elect to be evaluated under the Administrative Evaluation option.</p>
<p>The Administrative Evaluation method is the only option for die following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary unit members</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary unit members</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members under remediation plan due to an overall evaluation rating of partially<br/>meets or does not meet standards in the previous year</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have failed to complete previous Peer-based or Project-based<br/>Evaluation cycle deadlines in the previous year</p>
<p>16.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Evaluation Cycle:</p>
<p>Administrative evaluations will be conducted for two (2) consecutive years or more until the unit<br/>member has reached permanent status and has a meets or exceeds standards on the overall<br/>evaluation rating. A unit member under a remediation plan will remain on the Administrative<br/>Evaluation method until the unit member achieves a meets or exceeds standards on the overall<br/>evaluation rating.</p>
<p>16.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Evaluation Procedures and Timeline:</p>
<p>16.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September 1: At each work site, unit members shall be notified of<br/>and given access to District evaluation materials, including notification<br/>of primary evaluator. In preparation for the initial meeting with the<br/>evaluator unit members will:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the appropriate Continuum to mark their level of<br/>performance for each element of the standards. This detailed<br/>Continuum is retained by the evaluatee.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use their self-assessment on the Continuum to complete and<br/>submit the Reflection and Professional Goals form identifying<br/>strengths and areas of growth, and developing up to three<br/>professional goals.</p>
<p>16.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By September 15: Unit members meet with their primary evaluator to<br/>review Continuum and to present, discuss and agree upon professional<br/>goals.</p>
<p>16.5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 1: Unit members will receive notice of approval on<br/>professional goals. (MHFT and MHUSD will work with unit members<br/>who transfer to another site after the start of school.)</p>
