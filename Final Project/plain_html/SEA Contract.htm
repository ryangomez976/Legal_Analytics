<p>6.1.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good faith effort will be made to return the teacher to the same school<br/>and assignment upon completion of leave subject to the District's transfer<br/>and assignment policies.</p>

<p>6.2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person employed in a position requiring certification qualification<br/>is absent from his duties on account of employee illness or accident for a<br/>period of five school months or less, whether or not the absence arises out<br/>of or in the course of the employment of the employee, the amount<br/>deducted from the salary due him for any month in which the absence<br/>occurs shall not exceed the sum which is actually paid a substitute<br/>employee employed to fill his position during his absence, or, would have<br/>been paid to the substitute had he been employed. The District shall make<br/>every reasonable effort to secure the services of a substitute employee.</p>
<p>6.2.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each school year, every teacher shall receive a sick<br/>leave allotment credit, equal to his/her sick leave entitlement for the<br/>school year. A teacher may use his/her credited sick leave at any time<br/>during the school year.</p>

Catastrophic illness or injury<br/>shall be defined as an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time and<br/>he or she has exhausted all his/her sick leave and other paid<br/>time off excluding differential leave.</p></td></tr>

<p>Page 13</p>
<p>6.3.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must use all sick leave (but, not differential leave),<br/>as defined in Article 6.3.1., available to them before eligible for<br/>a withdrawal from the Bank.</p>
<p>6.3.3.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants who have exhausted sick leave, but still have<br/>differential leave available, are eligible for a withdrawal from<br/>the Catastrophic Leave Bank. The District shall pay the<br/>participant full pay and the Bank shall be charged one-half<br/>(1/2) day. Part-time employees will be prorated.</p>
<p>6.3.3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten (10) duty days of illness or disability must be<br/>covered by the participant's own sick leave, differential leave,<br/>or leave without pay the first time said participant qualifies for<br/>a withdrawal draw from the Bank. For subsequent withdrawals<br/>within twelve (12) consecutive months for any unrelated<br/>catastrophic illness, the first five (5) duty days of illness must<br/>be covered by the participant's own sick leave, differential<br/>leave, or leave without pay.</p>
<p>6.3.3.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant is incapacitated, applications may be submitted<br/>to the Committee by the participant's agent or member of the<br/>participant's family.</p>
<p>6.3.3.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be<br/>granted in units of no more than thirty (30) duty days.<br/>Participants may submit requests for extensions of withdrawals<br/>as their prior grants expire. A participant's withdrawal from the<br/>Bank may not exceed the statutory maximum draw of 60 days<br/>in a three (3)-year period per individual.</p>
<p>633.1. Participants applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal<br/>from the Catastrophic Leave Bank will be required to submit a<br/>doctor's statement indicating the nature of the illness or injury<br/>and the probable length of absence from work. Members of the<br/>Committee shall keep information regarding the nature of the<br/>illness confidential. A participant's withdrawal may not exceed<br/>the statutory maximum draw of 60 days in a three (3)-year<br/>period per individual.</p>
<p>6.3.3.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a participant has drawn thirty (30) Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>days and requests an extension, the Committee may require a<br/>medical review by a physician of the Committee's choice at the<br/>participant's expense. The Committee shall choose only a<br/>physician who qualifies under the District offered insurance<br/>policy. Refusal to submit to the medical review will terminate<br/>the participant's continued withdrawal from the Bank. The<br/>Committee may deny an extension of withdrawal from the</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Bank based upon the medical report. The<br/>participant may appeal any termination under the procedures<br/>outlined in Section 3.m. below.</p>
<p>6.3.3.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or disability<br/>which qualifies the participant for Workers' Compensation<br/>benefits unless the participant has exhausted all Workers'<br/>Compensation leave, his/her own sick leave, and provided<br/>further that the member signs over any Workers' Compensation<br/>checks for temporary benefits to the District. If there are any<br/>Workers' Compensation checks signed over to the Board, the<br/>Bank will not be charged days, or if charged, will be<br/>reimbursed the number of days for which the Workers'<br/>Compensation payment is equivalent to a regular day of pay at<br/>the negotiated rate for that participant. If the District challenges<br/>the Workers' Compensation claim, the participant may draw<br/>from the Bank, but upon settlement of the claim, the Bank shall<br/>be reimbursed the days by the District.</p>
<p>6.3.3.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee may reasonably presume that the<br/>applicant for a draw may be eligible for a Disability Award or a<br/>Retirement under STRS or, if applicable, Social Security, the<br/>Committee may request that the draw applicant apply for<br/>disability or retirement. Failure of the draw applicant to submit<br/>a complete application, including medical information<br/>provided by the applicant's physician, within twenty (20)<br/>calendar days will disqualify the draw applicant from further<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank payments. Any requests for<br/>additional medical information from STRS or Social Security<br/>shall be submitted within ten (10) days or the participant's<br/>entitlement to Catastrophic Leave Bank payments shall cease.</p>
<p>If denied benefits by STRS or Social Security, the applicant<br/>must appeal or entitlement to the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>shall cease.</p>
<p>6.3.3.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank does not have sufficient days to<br/>fund a withdrawal request, the Committee is under no<br/>obligation to provide days and the District is under no<br/>obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. If the<br/>Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension of<br/>withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the request,<br/>they shall notify the participant, in writing, of the reason for the<br/>denial.</p>
<p>6.3.3.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the<br/>exhaustion of sick leave and the waiting period provided for in</p>

<p>6.3.3.13.</p></td><td>
<p>Article 6.3.3 .4., whichever is greater. For example, if a<br/>participant contributed when first eligible to contribute (Article<br/>6.3.2.5) and had ten (10) days of accumulated sick leave when<br/>the illness began (Section 3.d.), he/she shall begin withdrawing<br/>upon the eleventh (11<sup>th</sup>) duty day, if otherwise eligible. If the<br/>participant had fifteen (15) days of sick leave at the beginning<br/>of the illness, he/she shall begin withdrawing days on the<br/>sixteenth (16th) duty day. If the participant had five (5) days of<br/>sick leave at the beginning of the illness, he/she shall begin<br/>withdrawing days on the eleventh (11<sup>th</sup>) duty day.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Bank participants who are denied a<br/>withdrawal or whose withdrawal is not renewed or is<br/>terminated may, within thirty (30) days of denial, grieve the<br/>denial, non renewal or termination. The participant shall be<br/>deemed the grievant, the Committee shall be deemed the<br/>District. All other provisions of the grievance procedure<br/>(Article 8) shall be interpreted in light of this. The Association<br/>shall provide representation to a grieving participant, unless the<br/>grievant refuses representation. If the participant's<br/>incapacitation does not allow participation in this appeal<br/>process, the participant's agent or member of the family may<br/>process the grievance.</p></td></tr>

<p>The salary for the teacher on sabbatical leave shall be the amount paid for<br/>Class I, Step 1, of the current salary schedule of the District for the year in<br/>which such leave is granted. The salary may be paid in the same manner<br/>that said teacher would normally be paid if teaching in the District.</p>

<p>6.8.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the leave, the teacher shall be entitled to sick leave,<br/>and absence for such purpose shall be deemed to have commenced on the<br/>date of termination of the industrial accident or illness leave.

<p>7.5.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the determination of voluntary transfers/reassignments, the wishes of<br/>the individual shall be honored to the extent that the transfer does not<br/>conflict with the instructional requirements and best interests of the school<br/>system. If more than one (1) teacher has applied for the same position, the<br/>determination of assignment will be made by the District on the basis of<br/>seniority, qualification, recency of experience, successful performance in<br/>the District, and effects of the transfer/reassignment on the sending and<br/>receiving schools.</p>
<p>In the event the more senior employee is bypassed, upon request of said<br/>employee the District shall provide a written statement detailing reasons<br/>for its decision.</p>
<p>7.5.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers requesting transfer from a site that is on year-round school shall<br/>be given right of first refusal over non-year-round school site teachers<br/>seeking the same non-year-round school site vacancy where the YRE<br/>teacher was initially assigned to that site at the time the site commenced<br/>YRE operation.</p>
<p>7.6. Year-Round School Site Level Track Assignments</p>

<p>7.8. Initial Staffing of New Sites</p>
<p>7.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New school sites shall be staffed by in-district teachers applying for<br/>voluntary transfers to the extent that the ratio of teacher experience<br/>reflects district wide experience distribution, as indicated on an employee<br/>experience list distributed at the initiation of this process.</p>
<p>7.8.1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will develop an employee experience list<br/>indicating the date of hire for each employee. That data will be<br/>ranked by date of hire and be distributed with intent forms by<br/>January 15<sup>th</sup> prior to the opening of a new school facility.</p>
<p>7.8.1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee experience list will indicate the group into<br/>which each employee is placed.</p>
<p>7.8.1.2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group “A” will include certificated employees who<br/>have two or less years of experience at the time the<br/>list is distributed. This group may include<br/>employees newly hired to staff the new school.</p>
<p>7.8.1.2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group “B” will include certificated employees who<br/>have more than two but less than eleven years of<br/>experience at the time the list is distributed.</p>

<p>7.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may refuse to transfer teachers if the ratio of experienced to<br/>new teachers is not within plus or minus twenty percent (20%) of<br/>experience groups.</p>
<p>7.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall not be involuntarily transferred unless:</p>
<p>7.8.3.1 there are insufficient volunteers to fill all vacancies at the site;<br/>or</p>
<p>7.8.1.1. the ratio of experienced teachers to new teachers that would<br/>result if staffed only by volunteers is not within plus or minus<br/>twenty percent (20%) of experience groups.</p>
<p>Page 29</p>
<p>7.8.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary transfer to the new site, or the first involuntary transfer to<br/>the vacant position created by any transfer to the new site, may be<br/>appealed at the request of the employee. The appeal will be heard by two<br/>(2) administrators appointed by the Superintendent and two (2) teachers<br/>appointed by the SEA President. The decision of the panel shall be final<br/>unless the panel cannot come to a decision favored by the majority of the<br/>panel (majority decision). In the event the panel cannot come to a majority<br/>decision, the panel will submit proposed solutions with supportive<br/>reasoning to the Superintendent for his/her action. The Superintendent's<br/>decision shall be final.</p>
<p>7.8.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any individual, who is involuntarily transferred due to the opening of a<br/>new site, will have the right, after two (2) years, to first right of refusal to<br/>return to any comparable vacant position for the third year.</p>
<p>8. COMPLAINT AND GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION<br/>PROCEDURE</p>
<p>8.1. Definitions</p>
<p>8.1.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim by a teacher that this contract has been violated<br/>or applied in a discriminatory manner, thus personally and adversely<br/>affecting the teacher.</p>
<p>8.1.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; is any teacher who is personally and directly involved in and<br/>adversely affected by an action or omission which is the basis for the<br/>grievance and who files a grievance in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<p>8.1.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in Article 3, a &quot;day&quot; means any day when the District Office<br/>is open. It is noted that Article 8.3.7.3 of this contract article allows for<br/>modification of time lines by mutual agreement of the Superintendent and<br/>an authorized Association representative.</p>
<p>8.2. Purpose</p>
<p>8.2.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may from<br/>time to time arise concerning the interpretation or application of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>8.2.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>teacher having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any<br/>appropriate member of the administration, and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted without intervention by the Association, provided that the<br/>adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Page 30</p>
<p>8.2.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible,<br/>the time limits specified at each level should be considered to be<br/>maximums and the parties are expected to expedite the process.</p>
<p>8.2.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school<br/>year, could result in irreparable harm to an aggrieved person, the time<br/>limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the procedure may be<br/>exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>8.3. Procedure</p>
<p>8.3.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Problem Solving: Any teacher with a complaint shall first present<br/>it to the immediate supervisor, who will endeavor to settle the matter<br/>informally. This conference shall be attended by the employee and<br/>immediate supervisor only with the exception of one silent observer who<br/>may be invited by either primary participant. Resolution of problems in<br/>such informal conferences shall not be binding upon the parties in<br/>subsequent grievances.</p>
<p>8.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: If the matter is not resolved informally, the teacher may<br/>submit a grievance in writing within twenty (20) days after the teacher<br/>knew or should have known of the problem which is the basis of his<br/>complaint or problem to the principal. Said grievance to be considered<br/>must be signed by the grievant and clearly specify: (1) the specific<br/>provision(s) of this contract that is alleged to have been violated; (2) how<br/>said provision(s) have been violated; (3) the date(s) on which said<br/>violation allegedly occurred; (4) the specific relief sought by the grievant;<br/>and (5) the reasons why the decision at the informal level was<br/>unsatisfactory. Copies of the grievance shall be sent by the grievant to the<br/>Association and the Superintendent.</p>
<p>After receiving the written grievance, the principal or his designee shall<br/>review the informal decision together with the written submission of the<br/>grievance. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written grievance,<br/>the principal shall issue a written decision on the grievance to all parties.</p>
<p>8.3.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the principal's<br/>decision, the grievant may appeal the decision to the Superintendent. The<br/>appeal shall be made by submitting a copy of the written grievance plus a<br/>clear and specific statement of the facts and conclusions which are<br/>appealed and the specific reasons why the principal's written decision is<br/>unacceptable. Such submission must be received by the Superintendent<br/>within fifteen (15) days after the decision.</p>
<p>Page 31</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall respond to the grievant with a copy to the<br/>Association within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written grievance.</p>
<p>8.3.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three: Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Superintendent's<br/>decision at Level Two, the grievant may submit the grievance to<br/>arbitration. Should the parties be unable to agree on an arbitrator,<br/>submission shall be to the American Arbitration Association and the<br/>parties will be bound by the rules and procedures of the American<br/>Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>8.3.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator will be without power or authority to amend, add to or<br/>subtract from this Agreement, but shall be restricted to a decision as to<br/>whether the Agreement has been violated and the relief, if any, to which<br/>the grievant is entitled. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and<br/>binding on all parties.</p>
<p>8.3.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the service of the arbitrator, including but not limited to per<br/>diem expenses, travel and subsistence, and costs of a hearing room, will be<br/>borne equally by the Association and the District. All other expenses will<br/>be borne by the party incurring them. Only the Association shall have the<br/>right to submit grievances to arbitration.</p>

<p>8.3.7.7.</p>
<p>8.3.7.8.</p>
<p>8.3.7.9.</p>
<p>The filing or pendency of any grievance shall in no way<br/>operate to impede, delay or interfere with the right of the<br/>District to take the action complained of.</p>
<p>Nothing contained in the Agreement shall be construed to<br/>prevent any individual teacher from presenting and processing<br/>a grievance, provided, however, that the Association has the<br/>right to be present and state its position.</p>
<p>Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal a grievance to<br/>the next step within the specified time limits shall preclude any<br/>further appeal on the grievance. Failure by the District to<br/>respond within specified time limits shall authorize the grievant<br/>to proceed to the next step in the procedure. The time limits<br/>specified in any step of this procedure may be changed in any<br/>specific instance only by mutual agreement, signed by the<br/>Superintendent and an authorized representative of the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>All documents, communication and records dealing with the<br/>processing of a grievance will be filed separately from the<br/>personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>Forms for processing grievances will be prepared by the<br/>District after consultation with the Association. The forms will<br/>be printed by the District and given appropriate distribution so<br/>as to facilitate operation of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>In the course of investigation of any grievance, representatives<br/>of any organization representing the grievant will report to the<br/>office and will identify themselves as an Association<br/>representative.</p>
<p>In processing grievances, the parties will make a good faith<br/>effort to avoid interruption of classroom activities and District<br/>operations and any unnecessary involvement of students in all<br/>phases of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>Appropriately posted and dated District notices shall be<br/>considered as binding all teachers and Association with<br/>knowledge of the contents of said notices.</p>
<p>The Association agrees not to support a grievance essentially<br/>similar to one denied by an arbitrator, and the District agrees to</p>
<p>Page 33</p>
<p>apply any decision to all cases which are essentially similar to<br/>one sustained by an arbitrator.</p>
<p>8.3.7.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties make a good faith effort to process group<br/>grievances jointly. Either party may separate such grievances<br/>by citing facts, in writing, regarded in good faith as justifying<br/>separation. If a group grievance is separated by the District, the<br/>time limits following Level One shall be suspended until the<br/>resolution of any grievance among those separated by the<br/>District, provided, however, that if a disagreement over<br/>essential similarity is resolved in arbitration adversely to a<br/>grievant, the time limits shall not be suspended for such<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>8.3.7.11. The grievant need not be present in order to process his/her<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>8.3.7.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to initiate grievances on<br/>Association rights as specifically provided in this Agreement.</p>
<p>8.3.7.13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right to initiate grievances on<br/>behalf of bargaining unit members. An Association-filed<br/>grievance may be filed at Level Two when the site principal<br/>lacks authority to resolve the grievance. However, in filing a<br/>grievance initially at Level Two, the Association shall provide<br/>notice of such filing to the Level Two Site Principal.</p>
<p>8.3.7.14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher may be represented by the Association if he/she so<br/>elects at all levels of the grievance procedure; provided,<br/>however, that only the Association shall have the right to<br/>submit a grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>9. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>9.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-time teacher workday shall include regularly assigned instructional duties<br/>and responsibilities in accordance with past practice. (See Article 9.14-22)</p>
<p>9.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Fridays, and days preceding holidays, teachers may leave as soon as their<br/>student responsibilities have been completed, provided supervisory duties, reports<br/>or conferences have been completed.</p>
<p>9.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jointly agreed upon calendar, when available, shall be distributed.</p>
<p>9.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to make no change in officially adopted District policy<br/>concerning hours of employment (including adjunct duties), lunch periods,</p>
<p>minimum days, preparation periods in grades 6-8, or rest periods, without<br/>consultation with the Association.</p>
<p>9.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the time when the K-6 regularly assigned teacher's class is being taught by<br/>a certificated teacher, such as Librarian, Art, or Music teacher, the regularly<br/>assigned teacher may leave his/her classroom for purposes of class preparation.<br/>Art and Music substitutes, if available, will be hired when those specialists are<br/>absent. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the total preparation<br/>minutes per week may not be the same for all regularly assigned teachers.</p>
<p>9.6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exercise of District discretion to excuse a teacher from the requirements of a<br/>normal work day shall not be construed as discriminatory treatment of teachers<br/>whose salary is deducted for unauthorized absences.</p>
<p>9.7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require two hundred (200) minutes of instructional time daily in<br/>kindergarten.</p>
<p>9.8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday shall be set aside as school staff meeting days. The District respects the<br/>time of professional educators and will regularly address, at least annually, the<br/>topic of meaningful, effective and time efficient faculty meetings with site<br/>administrators.</p>
<p>9.9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Term of This Agreement</p>
<p>9.9.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calendar for traditional and single-track schools shall include one<br/>hundred eighty (180) instructional days plus two (2) additional work days.</p>
<p>9.9.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calendar for multi-track year-round education schools shall include<br/>one hundred seventy-three (173) instructional days plus two (2) additional<br/>work days.</p>
<p>9.9.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees who work both Traditional/Single-Track and Year<br/>Round schools will be responsible for one hundred, seventy-eight (178)<br/>workdays.</p>
<p>9.9.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number and scheduling of &quot;traditional&quot; calendar minimum days,<br/>including but not limited to Parent Teacher Conferences, Open House, and<br/>Back-to-School Nights obligations shall maintain a number of annual<br/>instructional minutes that is consistent with the 1988/89 &quot;traditional&quot;<br/>calendar unless otherwise agreed to by the Association.</p>
<p>9.9.5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduling of Open House and Back-to-School Nights for any year-<br/>round calendar shall be determined by the affected school site principal<br/>and staff. In the event the site principal and staff are unable to agree, the<br/>District Superintendent shall, after consultation with the Association,<br/>determine when Open House shall occur.</p>
<p>9.9.6. Minimum days will be consistently applied to all grade levels at</p>
<p>elementary schools for district-operated general education programs. As<br/>much as reasonably possible, special education programs will be included<br/>in minimum days. This may result in fewer than 200 minutes of<br/>instruction (referenced in 9.7) in kindergarten classes on minimum days,<br/>however the required annual instructional minutes for kindergarten will<br/>not be compromised.</p>
<p>9.10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may arrange for five (5) exchange days per school year between unit<br/>members subject to the following:</p>
<p>9.10.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange days and dates must have the prior approval of the site<br/>principal.</p>
<p>9.10.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denial or approval shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>9.10.3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall have the responsibility for arranging for the exchange<br/>with another employee during the same school year. Starting with the<br/>1995/96 school year, all exchanges must be concluded by June 30 of the<br/>school year in which the exchanges were made. Exchanges not paid back<br/>by June 30 of the school year in which the exchanges were made shall<br/>result in a per diem deduction from the offending teacher's salary warrant.</p>
<p>9.10.4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall have no responsibility for any inequities that may arise<br/>between affected teachers based upon the exchange of days.</p>
<p>9.11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off-track personnel who are unable to attend regular District-wide in-service<br/>training programs are required to attend other in-service training scheduled to<br/>accommodate their teaching schedule. Such attendance at other in-service training<br/>shall not require the teacher to work beyond his/her regular number of work-year<br/>days and shall be scheduled so that it is continuous with a regular trimester.</p>
<p>9.12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support Staff Specialists:</p>
<p>9.12.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support staff specialists shall work together with the school site principal<br/>to determine a mutually agreeable schedule of workdays.

<p>justification.</p>

<p>15.10.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been employed by the District continuously for at least<br/>ten (10) years.</p>

<p>Page 53</p>
<p>District will extend the terminal date of this provision to be the<br/>month in which the retiree becomes sixty-seven (67). This<br/>agreement is contingent upon it being a net savings to the<br/>district (i.e., the savings derived from the retiring employee at<br/>VII-25 is greater than the sum of their retirement benefit cost<br/>plus the cost of a new replacement teacher coming in at IV-7 -<br/>projected out over the duration of that retirement benefit [12<br/>years], assuming the new teacher’s column movement every<br/>other year.)</p>

<p>15.10.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternately to the benefits provided in 15.8.4.1 printed above, a<br/>retiree may elect to receive an annual cash payment equal to<br/>the cost of the least expensive single employee premium<br/>offered by the District at the time of the retirement and frozen<br/>at that level for the duration of the eligibility period (as<br/>outlined in Article 15.8.2).</p>
<p>15.10.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiree Health Benefits Funds</p>
<p>15.10.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sylvan Union School District will place $319,000, as a<br/>permanent contribution to this fund during the 1998-99 school<br/>year.</p>
