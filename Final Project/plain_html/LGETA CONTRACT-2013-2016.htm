<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons have a common residence.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership<br/>with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.</p>

The exclusive representative shall<br/>represent all certificated unit members in positions listed in Article 3.1.1. below and<br/>who are regular permanent, probationary or temporary (Education Code Section 44920)<br/>unit members of the District, those on official Board approved leaves, or long-term<br/>substitutes who are employed more than eleven (11) consecutive days in the same<br/>position.</p>

<p>Special Education Program Specialist</p>
<p>Superintendent</p>
<p>Teaching Principal</p>

<p>3-1</p>
<p>Article 4. Hours of Employment</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular K-5 work day shall include thirty (30) minutes prior to the beginning of the<br/>assigned instruction and fifteen (15) minutes after the ending of the instructional day,<br/>but not less than 7 1 /2 hours including lunch, preparation time, recess/break, and time<br/>required before and after school. Any exception to this must be approved by the site<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>At the middle school 6-8, the regular 7 1 /2 hour workday shall include thirty minutes<br/>prior to the beginning of the assigned instructional day. Should a scheduling issue<br/>arise, e.g. Zero period, 7th period, the solution shall be reached by mutual agreement<br/>of the teachers and administration.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members must remain after their last school assignment as long as necessary to<br/>meet their responsibilities to the students and the educational program. Teachers shall<br/>be required to participate in teaching related duties which shall include staff meetings,<br/>grade level or department level meeting, Back-to-School-Night, Open House, parent/<br/>teacher conferences, district or local in-service. There shall be no more than five (5)<br/>required meetings per month unless mutually agreed upon by those involved. The<br/>following shall be voluntary with some teacher representation: PTA or home/school<br/>association meetings, task force, board meetings, and school site council meetings.<br/>Additional meetings will be required for people holding a stipend position in the district.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school teachers shall have one duty-free teaching period per day, aside from<br/>lunch, set aside for preparation, planning, counseling, and conferencing.</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2000-2001 school year, the District will furnish a certificated teacher to<br/>provide one duty-free 45-minute preparation period per week for each 4th/5th grade FTE<br/>(full-time equivalent). FTEs benefiting from the State CSR (Class Size Reduction)<br/>program do not qualify for this preparation period.</p>
<p>The intent of the preparation time is two-fold:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enrich the instructional program for students.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide teachers in 4th/5th grades with time to develop classroom plans<br/>or materials.</p>
<p>The preparation time teacher shall be responsible for planning, preparation of materials,<br/>and conduct of lessons. The presence of the regular classroom teacher shall not be<br/>required during the preparation time teacher’s program.</p>
<p>A schedule shall be developed allowing each 4th/5th credentialed regular education FTE<br/>(full-time equivalent) 45 minutes of preparation time per week. During elementary<br/>conference periods, a schedule shall be prepared allowing half of the eligible 4th/5th grade<br/>teachers their regularly scheduled preparation period during the fall conference time<br/>and the remaining half during the spring period, resulting in a loss of one scheduled<br/>preparation period.</p>
<p>The preparation time teacher will follow district guidelines to procure a substitute in<br/>case of illness or other absence.</p>
<p>Preparation time is considered on-campus preparation time.</p>
<p>4-1</p>
<p>4.4 All unit members shall be entitled to thirty (30) minutes of uninterrupted and continuous<br/>duty-free lunch. Nothing in the above shall preclude individuals or building staff from<br/>voluntarily utilizing the thirty (30) minutes for professional responsibilities.</p>
<p>No unit member teaching grades K-8 shall be required to work with children in excess of<br/>135 minutes consecutively if another unit member can be scheduled to relieve them, except<br/>during inclement weather or other unusual circumstances. Unit members teaching grades<br/>K-8 shall consult with the principal, and the principal shall assume responsibility for<br/>scheduling unit members' relief time during the morning recess.</p>
<p>No teacher shall have regularly scheduled noon-time duties.</p>
<p>Unit members may be required to augment or substitute for paid supervisors in any<br/>emergency.</p>
<p>Teachers in each school shall assist the principal, upon request, in securing supervisors by<br/>providing names of parents or other persons who may be interested to be interviewed<br/>by the principal.</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faculty meetings, which are defined as meetings involving the total site faculty,</p>
<p>shall normally be held no more than twice a month and shall be limited to 1 20 minutes<br/>monthly. Staff members shall be notified not less than one week in advance if a given<br/>monthly staff meeting shall be longer than 60 minutes in length. If a staff meeting runs<br/>over the allotted time, the principal will ask the teachers if they wish to continue or agree<br/>to adjourn to another time. Each unit member shall be provided an agenda for the faculty<br/>meeting at least one day in advance of the meeting. Unit members may place items on the<br/>agenda prior to its publication. School level planning and curriculum meetings may be called<br/>on alternate weeks. Such meetings, as opposed to meetings of the entire faculty, will<br/>normally involve only selected unit members serving on various committees or planning groups.<br/>Teachers and site administrators will collaboratively develop the agendas for these meetings.</p>
<p>4.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide five (5) minimum days for K-5 teachers for fall parent teacher<br/>conferences and five (5) minimum days for spring conferences. Minimum days for<br/>conferences shall consist of 210 instructional minutes, thus enabling the district to<br/>meet statutory requirements of an average of 240 instructional minutes over a 10 day<br/>period. Fall conferences will be held with all parents during the fall semester, either<br/>during the five (5) minimum days or by December 1.</p>
<p>Spring Conference forms will be sent out to all parents. Spring conferences will be held<br/>with all parents who desire a conference, and with those parents who the teacher or<br/>principal believes should attend a conference.</p>
<p>Minimum days shall be provided for all teachers (K-8) on Back-to-School and Open Flouse<br/>Nights. Minimum days for planning purposes shall also be provided. The number of such<br/>days will be determined annually by the district in accordance with identified need and<br/>state law. Minimum days for these purposes shall be the same length as Minimum Days<br/>for Back-to-School and Open Flouse Nights.</p>
<p>One release day will be provided to sixth grade core teachers during the year for planning.</p>
<p>Sixth grade core staff will schedule this release day as needed.</p>
<p>4-2</p>
<p>4.7 It is agreed that the number of instructional minutes in the regular school day<br/>will be as follows:</p>

<p>Twelve daily instructional minutes at Fisher Middle School (banked to establish late start<br/>collaboration time in 2005-2006) shall be reallocated only by consensus of the combined<br/>Fisher staff and administration should the late start collaboration time be suspended<br/>for any reason.</p>
<p>All schools will meet or exceed the yearly instructional minutes mandated by Education Code.</p>
<p>The work year will be made up of 1 84 days for returning teachers and 1 85 days for new<br/>teachers, 1 80 of which will be instructional days. Two non-instructional workdays for<br/>returning teachers (three for new teachers) will be scheduled prior to the onset of<br/>classes each fall. One of these days will be devoted to back-to-school meetings, and the<br/>other will be a teacher work day with no district or school scheduled meetings. The use<br/>of these non-instructional days may be altered in a given year, due to special<br/>circumstances, by mutual agreement between the District and the Association.</p>
<p>The parties recognize the consultation procedures of Government Code Section 3543.2.</p>
<p>The District agrees to consult with the association prior to March 1 to determine<br/>the calendar for the next school year.</p>
<p>4.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall, at its discretion, provide sufficient minimum days for the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee to meet with the Certificated Staff for the purpose of<br/>explaining new legislation which has a direct bearing on the Los Gatos educational system.<br/>Attendance will be mandatory and roll will be taken.</p>
<p>4.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may provide adequate professional visitation rights. Requests will be<br/>made at each school site, and approved by the district.</p>
<p>4.1 0 Zero Period Program</p>
<p>Participation in this program shall be voluntary and teacher assignment shall be consistent<br/>with Section 9.5.1 of the LGETA contract.</p>
<p>Assignment of a teacher to zero period will be based on the following considerations:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacher teaches from zero period through fifth period, with one period prep</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase hours of part-time unit members</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hire additional outside unit members</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase current status of full-time unit member to six-fifths<br/>Compensation shall be one-fifth of the regular salary.</p>
<p>Implementation of the zero period will not negatively impact class size. The Zero Period is<br/>to be evaluated each year by the school staff and Principal as part of the annual evaluation<br/>process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4-3</p>
<p>Article 5</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure</p>
<p>5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of a grievance procedure is to process a claim of grievance and to secure a<br/>resolution at the administrative level closest to the aggrieved. This grievance procedure<br/>shall not be construed as in any way hindering, discouraging, or denying the settlement<br/>of complaints outside the structure of the grievance procedure.</p>

<p>Article 6. Safety</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the certificated unit member to report unsafe, unsanitary or<br/>physically hazardous conditions to his/her immediate supervisor. The unit member shall<br/>confirm this report in writing, so that inspection and corrective action may be taken as<br/>deemed necessary by the Administration. In situations that fall within the scope of<br/>District employment, unit members may use reasonable force and means to protect<br/>themselves from attack, protect another person or property from attack, quell a<br/>disturbance threatening physical injury to others, or obtain possession of weapons<br/>upon the person or within control of another.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not knowingly be required to perform tasks which represent a clear<br/>and/or present danger to the health or safety of the unit member. However, such<br/>prohibition shall not be construed in such a manner that certificated unit members<br/>neglect their responsibilities to provide for student safety.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall immediately report cases of assault suffered by them in connection<br/>with their employment, including cases of attack by any pupil, to their principal or other<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>

<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may suspend a pupil from his/her class in accordance with the current State<br/>law. A copy of the current law will be maintained in the District Policies and Procedures<br/>Manual under Pupil Information and will be updated by any subsequent changes in</p>
<p>the law during the year.</p>

<p>Article 7.</p>
<p>Evaluation Procedures</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Los Gatos Union School District to develop a comprehensive system<br/>of unit member performance evaluation which results in the improved performance of unit<br/>members relative to their areas of responsibility. Further, the unit member evaluation<br/>system is intended to commend effective service, to provide clear direction and<br/>opportunity to improve for those in need of assistance, and to include due process for all.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance Areas</p>
<p>Evaluation of unit member competence will include an assessment of the following:</p>
<p>7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engaging and supporting all students in learning</p>
<p>7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding and organizing subject matter for student learning</p>
<p>7.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning</p>
<p>7.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students</p>
<p>7.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assessing student learning</p>
<p>7.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developing as a professional educator</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibility for Conducting Evaluation</p>
<p>Building principals and immediate supervisors shall serve as primary evaluators. A list of<br/>unit members to be evaluated, and the name of the primary evaluator, will be prepared<br/>and distributed to unit members by October 1 of each school year.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Evaluations</p>
<p>7.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each probationary unit member shall be evaluated at least annually; each<br/>permanent unit member with less than five (5) years of service in the District<br/>shall be evaluated at least once every two (2) years. Permanent unit members<br/>with five (5) or more years of service in the District and whose performance is<br/>satisfactory shall be evaluated once every three (3) years. Permanent unit<br/>members with five (5) or more years of service in the District and whose<br/>performance is satisfactory may be evaluated by the alternative evaluation system<br/>for as long as the evaluator and evaluatee mutually agree to the same. Nothing<br/>herein shall preclude more frequent evaluation.</p>
<p>7.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timetable for implementation of the District Professional Standards for Teachers<br/>Flaving Probationary 1, 2, and Temporary Status Section 7.1 0, will be followed<br/>for evaluation of probationary and temporary teachers.</p>
<p>7.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers will be given a copy of the LGUSD Professional Standards when they<br/>accept employment in the District. Staff development activities for new<br/>teachers will be held on a combination of release time and after school time.</p>
<p>7-1</p>
<p>Professional growth or university credit (when available) will be offered for<br/>activities held at times other than the normal workday.</p>
<p>7.4.4 Within thirty (30) days of change of status from temporary to probationary or<br/>probationary to permanent, written notice will be given to the unit member.</p>
<p>Evaluation Process</p>
<p>7.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary evaluator will hold a pre-evaluation conference with all unit members<br/>being evaluated that school year. The conference will include an<br/>explanation of the process and forms to be used and the determination of unit<br/>member objectives. Should the unit member and the evaluator fail to agree upon<br/>the unit member's objectives, the issue will be referred to the district<br/>administrator for certificated personnel who will make the final decision.</p>
<p>7.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For permanent teachers classroom observations may be made at any time. Each<br/>evaluation shall be preceded by at least one formal classroom observation of</p>
<p>30 minutes, and two informal classroom observations of at least 10 minutes.<br/>Additional observations of any duration may also be included. Probationary and<br/>temporary teacher classroom observations will follow attached timetable, 7.10.</p>
<p>7.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent and probationary unit members shall be given a written copy of their<br/>evaluation no later than 30 days before the last scheduled school day on the<br/>adopted district calendar. A conference shall be held between the evaluator(s)<br/>and the unit member prior to the last school day on the adopted district calendar.</p>
<p>7.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a rating of Improvement Needed is checked on the evaluation document, a<br/>Performance Evaluation Addendum must be completed and attached to the<br/>evaluation describing the reasons for the rating and listing suggestions for<br/>improvement, including involvement in Peer Assistance and Review (PAR).<br/>(Reference article 15.1) A Performance Evaluation Addendum describing<br/>effective or outstanding service may be completed and attached to the<br/>evaluation at the discretion of the evaluator.</p>
<p>7.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have been evaluated shall sign all evaluative materials,<br/>indicating that they have read the material. No agreement or disagreement<br/>with the content is implied by the unit member's signature.</p>
<p>7.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may attach a written response to the evaluation document. This<br/>response must be signed and dated and will become a permanent attachment to<br/>the evaluation.</p>
<p>7.5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three or more ratings of Improvement Needed on a permanent unit member's<br/>evaluation shall deem him/her unsatisfactory and shall require that the unit<br/>member participate in a remediation program.</p>
<p>7.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remediation process may be used for probationary unit members.</p>
<p>7.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitigating circumstances may arise which require modification of the evaluation<br/>parameters. The necessity for review of the evaluation criteria shall be<br/>determined either by the member or the evaluator, and the determination of<br/>new evaluation element(s) shall be mutually agreed upon by both. 7-2</p>
<p>7.5.10 The district administrator responsible for certificated personnel will decide if<br/>remediation is an appropriate course of action, based upon each individual<br/>situation.</p>
<p>7.6 Remediation</p>
<p>Remediation is intended to be a confidential and positive process designed to improve a<br/>permanent unit member's performance. Its intent is to assist the unit member to be<br/>effective in all stated performance areas.</p>
<p>7.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Processes Preceding Remediation</p>
<p>7.6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary evaluator will identify areas needing improvement in a<br/>unit member's service. An evaluation report will be prepared and a<br/>copy given to the unit member.</p>
<p>7.6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary evaluator will have worked with the unit member in an<br/>effort to correct difficulties, and the unit member will have been<br/>made aware that areas of performance have been judged in need of<br/>improvement.</p>
<p>7.6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district administrator responsible for certificated personnel will be<br/>advised that remediation is required and will be given a copy of all<br/>pertinent evaluations and reports.</p>
<p>7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of Remediation Personnel</p>
<p>7.6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personnel department administrator, with the primary evaluator,<br/>will advise the unit member of the procedure to be followed, rights<br/>under the law, and the resources available.</p>
<p>7.6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personnel administrator will meet with the unit member and<br/>provide assistance in the selection of a remediation team. The<br/>remediation team will consist of one classroom teacher and the<br/>primary evaluator. One other administrator, and one other<br/>certificated unit member shall both be chosen by the unit member.</p>
<p>7.6.23 The remediation team will be selected within ten teaching days from<br/>the date of the evaluation conference between the evaluator and the<br/>unit member at which time remediation was determined to be required.</p>
<p>7.6.3 Remediation Process</p>
<p>7.6.3.1 The remediation team members will review written documented</p>
<p>evidence of the unit member's less than effective performance, and<br/>will confer with the unit member.</p>

<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students in Special Day Classes who are &quot;mainstreamed&quot; into regular K-8 classrooms for<br/>part of a school day and who cause the ratios referred to in sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.5 to be<br/>exceeded, shall cause the allocation of aide time only when the affected teacher and the<br/>principal agree that the mainstreaming is of a significant duration or nature to warrant the<br/>allocation of aide time.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual ratio of pupils to the total number of classroom teachers at each school site<br/>shall not exceed the following:</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten - Third&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth - Eighth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(district-wide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average)</p>

Sufficient staff will also be<br/>assigned so that the average size of sixth grade core classes shall not exceed 28.<br/>Teacher preparation periods shall not be included in these calculations.</p>
<p>8.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Day Class teachers, elementary music teachers, nurses, librarians, and<br/>district specialists will not be utilized in the computation or application of the<br/>above class sizes.</p>
<p>8.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For middle school physical education, the gender of both teachers and students may<br/>be mixed in order to accommodate an optimal class size of 40 or less. In the event<br/>that optimal class size is exceeded, 8.6 of the contract will be implemented.</p>

<p>8.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall discuss with appropriate staff members the<br/>alternatives which might better meet the needs of the students, the teachers, and<br/>the instructional program.</p>
<p>8.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After alternative solutions to the instructional needs of the District have been<br/>explored with the affected teachers, the immediate supervisor shall determine the<br/>most appropriate action to take based on the enrollment of the school site, the<br/>grade level, the content of the courses, methodology of instruction, the<br/>learning abilities of the students, the needs of the teachers, the needs of the<br/>students, and the financial ability of the District to pay.</p>
<p>8-1</p>
<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratios shall not be maintained by assigning children of the same family to different schools.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an individual K-5 class exceeds the class size ratio by two or more students and the unit<br/>member has been unable to resolve the situation satisfactorily with the principal, the unit<br/>member may appeal the problem to the Superintendent in an effort to resolve the matter,<br/>or may make a request to the Superintendent and receive instructional aide time of six (6)<br/>hours per week for the first multiple of two students exceeding the ratio, and three (3) hour<br/>per week for each subsequent multiple of two (2) students, up to a maximum of twelve</p>
<p>(1 2) hours of aide time per week per teacher.</p>
<p>Allocation of aide time will be determined by the site administrator, based on the availability<br/>of instructional aides. Aides cannot be assigned to classrooms until normal employment<br/>procedures have transpired, but aides will be authorized to &quot;make up&quot; the hours accrued<br/>between the time a class qualifies for additional aide hours and the aide's employment date.<br/>The scheduling of such hours will be mutually determined by the affected teacher and the<br/>school principal.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the 7-8 grade level, six hours per week of instructional or clerical aide time (at the<br/>discretion of the teacher) will be made available to any teacher, except PE and music<br/>teachers, who has in excess of 1 50 students in his/her five assigned periods. Weekly<br/>aide time will be pro-rated, and rounded off to the nearest hour for teachers with less<br/>than a full time teaching assignment.</p>
<p>8.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of identified SDC, RSP, and EL students in a regular classroom shall be<br/>recognized by the building administrator in balancing teaching loads.</p>
<p>8.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a change in legislation, state budget and/or local revenue affects this article,<br/>both parties agree to open negotiations for the purpose of considering any adjustments<br/>to the existing language.</p>

<p>9.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a requested assignment by the unit member has not been granted, the<br/>principal, upon request, shall provide within five (5) days in writing to the unit<br/>member the basis as noted in 9.5.1 for his/her decision in not granting the<br/>requested assignment.</p>
<p>9.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If newly assigned teacher(s) to a school are known before the subsequent<br/>school year's assignments are made, the administration shall poll him/her<br/>for the assignment preference.</p>
<p>9.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignments within a school, after the initial assignments have been announced,<br/>may be made by the building principal, based on extenuating, compelling reasons<br/>not covered in this article.</p>

<p>9.6 School Closures</p>
<p>Unit members shall have the right to express their preference to assignments on a<br/>survey form. The District will consider the unit member's previous grade level and/or<br/>subject experience, and credential requirements in making assignments following a school<br/>closure. Should the administration determine that there are not significant differences in<br/>experience, credentials, major/minors, or teacher preference, seniority will be the<br/>deciding factor. Unit members who do not receive their first or second preference to<br/>assignments may request reasons in writing from the District as to why their preferences<br/>were not granted.</p>

<p>1 2.7.3 Effective 2005-06 school year, employees with 10 to 14 years of</p>
