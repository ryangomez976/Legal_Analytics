<p>collaborative process between administration, and<br/>certificated staff at each school site, with equitable<br/>assignment of hours as a priority. The Association Site<br/>Representative shall be a participant in the discussions and<br/>determination of adjunct duty lists. Discussions to<br/>determine the year’s adjunct duty assignments shall be part<br/>of each site’s planning for the following year.</p>
<p>The District and Association are committed to a<br/>collaborative and equitable process for the assignment of<br/>adjunct duties at the elementary and secondary levels.<br/>Reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that all staff<br/>are present during this process. This process should<br/>include discussion between Bargaining Unit members and<br/>the principal, and consideration of alternatives in the<br/>assignment of adjunct duties. In a situation where the<br/>principal and staff are not able to resolve an assignment of<br/>adjunct duties, the issue may be appealed to the Division<br/>level.</p>
<p>Reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that all staff<br/>have the opportunity to sign-up (volunteer) for their<br/>adjunct duties by scheduling sign-ups at a time when<br/>staff members have the opportunity to be present.<br/>Unfilled duties may then be assigned to bargaining unit<br/>members. Adjunct duties shall be assigned according to<br/>a fair and equitable process.</p>
<p>When adjunct duty assignments occur on non-duty days,<br/>including but not limited to weekends, holidays, and<br/>vacation, every effort will be made to seek volunteers to fill<br/>the assignment.</p>
<p>In recognition that Elementary Outdoor Science School<br/>requires overnight stays, teachers who accompany students<br/>to Outdoor Science Schools lasting for three or more days<br/>shall also be entitled to an extra duty stipend of $240.</p>
<p>The scheduling of all known adjunct duties shall be<br/>completed by the end of the first school month.</p>
<p>If unforeseen situations occur during the year in which<br/>duties are needed, then such duties shall be assigned on a<br/>voluntary basis when possible in preference to mandatory<br/>assignments.</p>

<p>ARTICLE IX<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>9.0 The Evaluation Program shall consist of five (5) different evaluation paths.</p>
<p>Placement on each path is determined either by permanency status, teaching, or<br/>non-teaching responsibilities, and prior performance achievement. Specific forms<br/>have been developed for all paths. Assessments include five (5) performance<br/>standards (Roman Numerals) with fourteen (14) subsections (letters) and multiple<br/>indicators (asterisks) that describe in detail the criteria that can be used in<br/>determining the teacher’s progress in achieving the performance standards. These<br/>standards have been correlated to the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession. Data collected through formal and informal observations by the<br/>evaluator, student data, and conferences will be used to complete the assessment.<br/>Data recorded on the assessment will then be used to complete the final<br/>evaluation summary which becomes a permanent record.</p>
<p>Specific timelines and assessment periods vary for each path. Non-permanent<br/>Bargaining Unit members working over 40% of the year shall be evaluated every<br/>year.</p>
<p>Permanent Bargaining Unit members who meet Ed. Code 44664 requirements<br/>will be evaluated at least every five (5) years consistent with Education Code<br/>44664 unless they are informed otherwise according to the process. (See<br/>Appendix B for Ed. Code.)</p>

<p>District Initials</p>
<p>9.1 Path Descriptions:</p>
<p>9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Permanent Path: Temporary (over 40%) and Probationary teachers<br/>shall be placed on this path until permanent status is obtained. Teachers<br/>will be assessed three (3) times a year to determine performance<br/>achievement toward standards identified on the form and may include<br/>other indicators.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Path: Teachers with permanent status shall be placed on this<br/>path, and if satisfactory performance achievement is maintained, will be<br/>evaluated each year unless Ed. Code 44664 is applied. During the<br/>evaluation year, teachers will be assessed at least twice to determine<br/>performance achievement toward standards identified on the form and<br/>other indicators that have been mutually agreed upon. Teachers may<br/>complete self-assessments prior to the fall conference and spring<br/>evaluation. The will receive a final summary evaluation in the spring.</p>
<p>9.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative Path: Teachers with permanent status may select this path for<br/>the next evaluation cycle if the prior evaluation was satisfactory. The<br/>teacher must maintain satisfactory performance during the non-evaluation<br/>year in order to use the alternative path for the next evaluation. On this<br/>path, teachers will continue to meet performance standards and will<br/>identify objectives to be approved by the evaluator.</p>
<p>9.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remedial Path: Teachers with permanent status who receive a “2” (Needs<br/>Improvement) in two (2) or more of the five (5) performance standards, or<br/>receive a “1” (Unsatisfactory) in one (1) or more of the five (5)<br/>performance standards on the final summary evaluation in the spring shall<br/>be placed on the remedial path for the next year. A “1” (Unsatisfactory)<br/>final mark will be determined by having a majority of the subsections<br/>marked under the matching performance standard “1.” A “2” (Needs<br/>Improvement) final mark will be determined by having appropriate<br/>documentation relevant to the indicators. Teachers on this path will be<br/>assessed three (3) times a year to determine performance achievement<br/>toward standards identified on the assessment.</p>
<p>9.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Classroom Path: Instructional support staff that do not have<br/>classroom responsibilities shall be evaluated using the new form (i.e.,<br/>psychologists, counselors, librarians, nurses, adaptive PE, specialists and<br/>special assignments, (speech/itinerant/visually impaired teachers etc.).<br/>Non-permanent teachers shall be assessed each year until permanency is<br/>obtained.</p>

<p>arising directly out of and in the course and scope of their<br/>employment shall be eligible for a maximum of seventy (70)<br/>allowable working days paid leave in any one (1) fiscal year.

<p>month. Industrial accident and illness leave shall be reduced by<br/>one (1) day for each day of authorized absence, regardless of<br/>compensation award made under Worker’s Compensation.

If, however, the Bargaining Unit<br/>member continues to receive temporary disability indemnity under<br/>the Worker’s Compensation laws of this state at the time of the<br/>exhaustion of benefits under this section, the Bargaining Unit<br/>member may elect to take as much of the Bargaining Unit<br/>member’s accumulated and available sick leave, which, when<br/>added to the Worker’s Compensation award, results in a payment<br/>of not more than the Bargaining Unit member’s regular salary.</p>

Bargaining Unit<br/>members called for jury duty must notify the District of service dates upon<br/>receiving said notice from officers of the Court. The equivalent of the jury duty<br/>stipend received by the Bargaining Unit member (excluding that portion received<br/>as mileage) shall be deducted from the appropriate pay period. Bargaining Unit<br/>members are required to return to work during any day in which jury duty<br/>services are not required.

<p>For purposes of this program, “catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness<br/>or injury that is expected to incapacitate the Unit member for an extended period<br/>of time, or that incapacitates a member of the Unit member’s immediate family<br/>which incapacity requires the Unit member to take time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time to care for that immediate family member, and taking<br/>extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the Unit member because<br/>he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave and other paid time off.</p>
<p>A Bargaining Unit member who requests catastrophic leave for himself/herself<br/>must have exhausted all accrued paid leave credits including but not limited to<br/>vacation days, workers’ compensation pay, differential paid days, and income<br/>protection before the use of this provision.</p>

<p>Such member must submit to the District the nature of the catastrophic illness or<br/>injury verified by a doctor or other health care provider and the approximate<br/>duration of time off needed. An eligible Unit member may only be granted one<br/>catastrophic leave of absence not to extend beyond June.</p>
<p>If the District and Association determine that the requesting member meets the<br/>criteria, the District will seek donations from the requesting member’s site via a<br/>joint Association and District memo. If additional days are needed, the memo will<br/>be distributed to additional sites, as necessary.</p>
<p>Any and all donated days transferred to an eligible Unit member shall be<br/>irrevocable. The number of total days donated will not extend past 185 school<br/>days or the end of the school year, whichever occurs first, but the requestor must<br/>provide official doctor verification if additional days are requested.</p>
<p>If the requesting Unit member does not use all of the donated days, then the<br/>unused days will be returned to donors via an Association lottery.</p>

Both<br/>parties shall agree upon a mediator secured from the California<br/>Mediation and Conciliation Service (CMCS). The parties may also<br/>mutually agree upon another mediator.</p>
<p>If the parties agree upon CMCS then either party may contact the<br/>California Mediation and Conciliation Service (CMCS) to supply a<br/>list of five (5) names.</p>
<p>Each party will alternately strike from the list until only one (1)<br/>name remains. The order of striking will be determined by a flip of<br/>a coin. By mutual agreement between the parties, arbitration<br/>procedures may be used. The rules of CMCS then in force shall be<br/>utilized by the parties in the conduct of the hearing.</p>

<p>The opinions and conclusions of the mediator are to be given<br/>serious consideration as an acceptable resolution to the dispute, but<br/>they may be rejected by either party by writing to the other stating<br/>the reasons for the rejection. The reasons stated are not subject to<br/>challenge.</p>
<p>17.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District or Association rejects the opinion or conclusion of<br/>the mediator, the opposing party may forward the grievance to the<br/>California Mediation and Conciliation Service (CMCS) to request<br/>that they supply a list of names of five (5) arbitrators. Each party<br/>will alternately strike from the list until only one (1) name remains.<br/>The order of striking will be determined by a flip of a coin. By<br/>mutual agreement between the parties, arbitration procedures may<br/>be used. The rules of CMCS then in force shall be utilized by the<br/>parties in the conduct of the hearing.</p>
<p>17.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the function of the arbitrator to make an award that will<br/>resolve the grievance. The arbitrator shall be subject to the<br/>following limitations:</p>

<p>17.3.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, the arbitrator, by referring to the<br/>written grievance and the answers thereto at each<br/>previous step, shall determine whether a grievance<br/>exists.</p>
<p>17.3.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing, and after both parties have had an<br/>opportunity to make written arguments, the<br/>arbitrator shall submit, in writing to all parties,<br/>his/her findings and award which shall be final and<br/>binding on the parties.</p>
<p>17.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be equally shared by the Association<br/>and the Board. All other expenses shall be borne by the parties incurring them and<br/>neither party shall be responsible for the expense of the witnesses called by the<br/>other.</p>
<p>17.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator may hear and determine only one (1) grievance at a time unless the<br/>Board agrees otherwise. However, both parties will, in good faith, endeavor to</p>
<p>District Initials</p>
<p>handle in an expeditious and convenient manner cases that involve the same or<br/>similar facts and issues.</p>
<p>17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either party may request a certified court reported to record the entire arbitration<br/>hearing. The cost of service and the expense of such report shall be paid by the<br/>party requesting the report or shared by the parties if both mutually agree.</p>
<p>17.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All procedural documents, communications, and other records dealing with the<br/>processing of a grievance shall be files separately from the personnel files of the<br/>grievant or participants and shall be treated in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>17.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agree that no adverse actions shall be taken against the grievant or<br/>participants in the grievance process.</p>
<p>17.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release time to the grievant and participants shall be utilized for the purpose of<br/>discussions and hearing involved in the grievance process. Preparation of<br/>materials or supporting documents shall take place outside of normal working<br/>hours.</p>

<p>17.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where more than one (1) grievance is filed and the underlying facts of the<br/>grievance are agreed to by the parties as being identical, the first such grievance<br/>shall be processed to a resolution and the result shall be binding upon the parties<br/>as to the balance of the identical grievances thus filed.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XVIII<br/>SAFETY</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board agrees to correct unsafe working conditions or situations that<br/>constitute a serious threat to the Bargaining Unit member’s health or safety.<br/>Corrections to conditions representing an immediate hazard to the safety or health<br/>of a Bargaining Unit member shall take place as soon as possible after the<br/>employee’s immediate supervisor has been notified.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under emergency hazardous conditions, the Bargaining Unit member may take<br/>actions essential to abate the condition to the extent necessary to protect<br/>himself/herself from the hazard and shall report immediately to the Bargaining<br/>Unit member’s supervisor.</p>
<p>-60-</p>
<p>District Initials</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining Unit members shall immediately report cases of assault, threat, or<br/>vandalism suffered by them in connection with their employment to their<br/>principal or other immediate supervisor who shall immediately notify the police<br/>to come to the school.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site committees will be established upon request to generate alternatives with<br/>recommendations for cost items to division chiefs.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIX<br/>SAVINGS</p>
<p>19.1 If any provisions of this Document and/or applications thereof are held to be<br/>contrary to law by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provisions or<br/>applications shall not be deemed valid and subsisting except to the extent<br/>permitted by law, but all other provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XX<br/>PROFESSIONALISM</p>
<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP)</p>
<p>The District and Association agree that all Bargaining Unit members shall strive<br/>to model the Standards for the Teaching Profession identified by the California<br/>Commission on Teacher Credentialing.</p>
<p>20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Growth</p>
<p>The District and Association agree that managers and Bargaining Unit members<br/>will conform to the Professional Growth requirements as enumerated in Sections<br/>44277 through 44279 of the California Education Code, and Sections 80550<br/>through 80565 of the California Administrative Code.</p>
<p>20.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Attire</p>
<p>The District and Association believe that all employees must practice the tenets of<br/>the District’s mission statement and core values. We believe in a child-centered<br/>environment that promotes the values of integrity, respect, responsibility, safety,<br/>and excellence.</p>
<p>An essential part of the teaching-learning process is that of the employees as a<br/>role model for students. Since all employees serve as role models, it is important<br/>that they maintain professional standards of attire. Just as overall attitude and<br/>competency contribute to a productive learning environment, so do appropriate<br/>dress and grooming.</p>
<p>-61 -</p>
<p>District Initials</p>
<p>Professional attire demonstrates a high regard for education and represents a<br/>professional image to the community consistent with an individual’s job<br/>responsibilities. Dressing professionally is defined as wearing neat, clean, and<br/>appropriate clothing that is not overly casual, distracting, ill-fitting, or poorly<br/>maintained. It is recognized that ongoing dialogue is needed between site<br/>administration and staff which will provide valuable and practical feedback for<br/>future negotiations.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXI<br/>CONCERTED ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>21.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed and understood that there will be no strike, work stoppage, slowdown,<br/>picketing or other Association approved and condoned concerted action or refusal<br/>or failure to fully and faithfully perform job functions and responsibilities, or<br/>other interference with the operations of the District by the Association or by its<br/>officers, agents, or members during the term of this Document, including<br/>compliance with the request of other labor organizations to engage in such<br/>activity.</p>
<p>21.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association recognizes the duty and obligation of its representatives to<br/>comply with the provision of this Document and to make every reasonable effort<br/>toward inducing all Bargaining Unit members to do so. In the event of an<br/>unsanctioned strike, work stoppage, slowdown, or other interference with the<br/>operations of the District by Bargaining Unit members who are represented by the<br/>Association, the Association agrees in good faith to take all reasonable and<br/>necessary steps to cause those employees to cease such action.</p>
<p>21.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed and understood that any Bargaining Unit member violating this<br/>Article may be subject to discipline up to and including termination by the Board.</p>
<p>21.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that in the event this Article is violated by the Association, its<br/>officers or agents, the Board shall be entitled to withdraw any rights, privileges or<br/>services provided in this Document.</p>
<p>21.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intent of the Board to forbid attendance at Board meetings or<br/>communications with members of the community. It is likewise not the intent of<br/>the Board to forbid lawful informational picketing during the period of<br/>negotiations.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXII<br/>MANAGEMENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

<p>22.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board, on its own behalf and on behalf of the electors of the District, hereby<br/>retains and reserves unto itself, without limitation, all powers, rights, authority,<br/>duties and responsibilities conferred upon and vested in it by the laws and the<br/>Constitution of the State of California, and of the United States, including, but<br/>without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the right:</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIII<br/>ZIPPER</p>
<p>23.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Document, both parties waive and relinquish the right to<br/>meet and negotiate and agree that neither party shall be obliged to meet and<br/>negotiate except by mutual consent.</p>
<p>23.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, during the term of this Document, the parties hereto should mutually and<br/>voluntarily agree to modify, amend, or alter the provisions of this Document in<br/>any respect, any such changes shall be effective only if reduced to writing and<br/>executed by authorized representatives of the District and Association. Any such<br/>changes validly made shall become a part of this Document.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXIV<br/>SITE-BASED DECISION-MAKING</p>
<p>24.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and ARE remain committed to continuing the long standing tradition<br/>of involving Bargaining Unit members in all major initiatives of the District.</p>
<p>24.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves its management rights to appoint employees to any position<br/>listed on the extra duty pay assignment or other non-classroom compensated<br/>assignments. Site administrators will consider input from Bargaining Unit<br/>members prior to making the appointment. All extra duty assignments or other<br/>non-classroom compensated assignments will be posted on the school site<br/>designated ARE bulletin board.</p>
<p>24.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site-Specific Amendments</p>
<p>Site-specific amendments to the collective bargaining agreement may be mutually<br/>agreed by the District and ARE. These site-specific amendments shall be in effect<br/>for one (1) year. The District and ARE will each develop procedures that are<br/>mutually compatible and include final approval provisions by the ARE Board of<br/>Directors and the Board of Education.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXV<br/>DUE PROCESS</p>
<p>25.1 The provisions of this Article apply only to Bargaining Unit members with<br/>permanent status. The Education Code will be followed for non-permanent<br/>Bargaining Unit members. The District and Association support the concept of<br/>progressive discipline. Most problems that occur should first be handled at an<br/>informal level between the Bargaining Unit member and the administrator.<br/>However, if problems are not solved at this informal level, formal steps have been<br/>identified as a recourse to change inappropriate behavior and/or correct a<br/>violation.</p>
<p>-64-</p>
<p>District Initials</p>
<p>25.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that disciplinary actions shall be consistent with the degree of<br/>unacceptable behavior</p>
<p>25.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Bargaining Unit member does not adhere to contract provision Education<br/>Code statutes, state/federal laws, applicable Board Policies and/or other standards<br/>of behavior that are expected of professional educators, the administrator shall<br/>present the facts to the Bargaining Unit member and at such time, an Association<br/>representative will be present at this meeting if requested by the Bargaining Unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>25.4 If the administrator determines that formal discipline short of dismissal is<br/>warranted, he/she will proceed with the following disciplinary steps. If the<br/>administrator determines that an oral and /or written warning is insufficient, a<br/>written reprimand may be issued without an oral or written warning (see<br/>25.4.3.1).</p>
<p>25.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warning:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conference will be held wherein the administrator</p>
<p>informs the Bargaining Unit member of the concern and will state<br/>directives to correct the problem. A summary paragraph will be<br/>written and given to the Bargaining Unit member and such<br/>summary will not be placed in the Human Resources File.</p>
<p>25.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warning:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conference will be held and the Bargaining</p>
<p>Unit member will be directed to correct the problem. The<br/>Bargaining Unit member will be given a written warning stating<br/>that he/she will receive further disciplinary action if the problem<br/>continues and such warning will not be placed in the Human<br/>Resources File.</p>
<p>25.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reprimand:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conference will be held and the Bargaining</p>
<p>Unit member will be given a formal letter of reprimand and<br/>directed to sign to acknowledge receipt. The reprimand shall be<br/>placed in member’s Human Resources File. The letter will<br/>reference specifi c provi sion of Education Code, or other state and<br/>federal laws, policies or other regulations as defined in 23.3 that<br/>the Bargaining Unit member violated and the steps for<br/>remediation. Pursuant to Education Code 44031, the Bargaining<br/>Unit member shall have the opportunity to review and comment on<br/>the contents of the written reprimand prior to it being placed into<br/>the Bargaining Unit member’s personnel file. The written<br/>reprimand and any written response shall be forwarded to Human<br/>Resources within 10 days of it being given to the bargaining unit<br/>member.</p>

<p>25.4.4</p>
<p>District Initials</p>
<p>25.4.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an administrator issues a written reprimand<br/>without the oral or written warning, the employee<br/>may appeal the reprimand by requesting a meeting<br/>within ten (10) days with a representative assigned<br/>by Association and a representative assigned by the<br/>District to review the cause for the reprimand. If the<br/>parties agree, the reprimand will either be placed in<br/>the Human Resources File or will be reduced to a<br/>written warning and not placed in the Human<br/>Resources File. This section shall not be used if the<br/>Bargaining Unit member received an oral and/or<br/>written warning for the same violation prior to<br/>receiving the written reprimand.</p>
<p>25.4.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Code 44031 will be followed in regard to<br/>the Bargaining Unit member’s right to inspect and<br/>respond to information of a derogatory nature that is<br/>contained in their Human Resources file.</p>
<p>Suspension: If a Bargaining Unit member does not correct the</p>
<p>violation, he/she shall be recommended for suspension to the</p>
<p>Board of Education. The administrator, in consultation with the</p>
<p>appropriate Assistant Superintendent, may recommend:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial pay suspension - maximum one (1) day. In this<br/>case, the teacher will pay for a substitute and receive<br/>difference pay.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid suspension - from one (1) day to a maximum of<br/>fifteen (15) days.</p>
<p>25.4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpaid suspension shall not exceed a total of fifteen<br/>(15) days in one school year. In all instances, the<br/>length of suspension shall relate to the severity of<br/>the action and the disciplinary history of the<br/>Bargaining Unit member. Suspension shall not<br/>reduce or deprive the Bargaining Unit member of<br/>health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>25.4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator, in consultation with the<br/>appropriate Assistant Superintendent, shall include<br/>in his/her recommendation to the Board, a rationale<br/>for the number of days suspended. A copy of the<br/>administrators recommendation will be given to the<br/>Bargaining Unit member.</p>
<p>-66-</p>
<p>District Initials</p>
<p>25.4.5</p>
<p>25 .4.4.3 The Bargaining Unit member shall have an<br/>opportunity to attend a meeting with District<br/>personnel and be represented by Association prior<br/>to their recommendation being forwarded to the<br/>Board. If agreement is reached, the suspension may<br/>stand, be reduced, or dismissed. If agreement is not<br/>reached, either party may request a state mediator.<br/>The state mediator’s decision will not be binding.</p>
<p>25 .4.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Bargaining Unit member wishes to arbitrate</p>
<p>the Board’s final decision, he/she may request an<br/>expedited arbitration through Association and<br/>Section 17.3.4 shall be followed. In the meantime,<br/>the suspension shall be imposed.</p>
<p>25.4.4.5 The District and Association shall maintain a list of<br/>five (5) agreed upon arbitrators if an expedited<br/>arbitration is needed. The hearing shall take place in<br/>a timely manner unless unforeseen circumstances<br/>occur that prevent a hearing from proceeding.</p>
<p>Dismissal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining Unit member does not correct the</p>
<p>violation, he/she shall be recommended for<br/>dismissal to the Board of Education pursuant to the<br/>California Education Code.</p>
<p>25.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article in no way limits the District’s ability to non re-elect temporary or<br/>probationary Bargaining Unit members as stated in their employment contracts<br/>and/or specified in the California Education Code.</p>
<p>25.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of progressive steps in no way limits the District’s authority to<br/>dismiss an employee for serious offenses as defined in the Education Code,<br/>state/federal law, and applicable Board Policies.</p>

<p>APPENDIX B</p>
<p>EDUCATION CODE 44664</p>
<p>44664. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Evaluation and assessment of the performance of each</p>
<p>certificated employee shall be made on a continuing basis as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least once each school year for probationary personnel.</p>
<p>(2) At least every other year for personnel with permanent status.</p>
<p>(3) At least every five years for personnel with permanent status<br/>who have been employed at least 10 years with the school district,<br/>are highly qualified, if those personnel occupy positions that are<br/>required to be filled by a highly qualified professional by the<br/>federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 6301, et<br/>seq.), as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 7801, and whose previous<br/>evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if<br/>the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree. The<br/>certificated employee or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any<br/>time.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation shall include recommendations, if necessary, as<br/>to areas of improvement in the performance of the employee. If an<br/>employee is not performing his or her duties in a satisfactory manner<br/>according to the standards prescribed by the governing board, the<br/>employing authority shall notify the employee in writing of that fact<br/>and describe the unsatisfactory performance. The employing authority<br/>shall thereafter confer with the employee making specific<br/>recommendations as to areas of improvement in the employee's<br/>performance and endeavor to assist the employee in his or her<br/>performance. If any permanent certificated employee has received an<br/>unsatisfactory evaluation, the employing authority shall annually<br/>evaluate the employee until the employee achieves a positive<br/>evaluation or is separated from the district.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any evaluation performed pursuant to this article which<br/>contains an unsatisfactory rating of an employee's performance in the<br/>area of teaching methods or instruction may include the requirement<br/>that the certificated employee shall, as determined necessary by the<br/>employing authority, participate in a program designed to improve<br/>appropriate areas of the employee's performance and to further pupil<br/>achievement and the instructional objectives of the employing<br/>authority. If a district participates in the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Program for Teachers established pursuant to Article 4.5<br/>(commencing with Section 44500), any certificated employee who<br/>receives an unsatisfactory rating on an evaluation performed pursuant<br/>to this section shall participate in the Peer Assistance and Review<br/>Program for Teachers.</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hourly and temporary hourly certificated employees, other than<br/>those employed in adult education classes who are excluded by the<br/>provisions of Section 44660, and substitute teachers may be excluded<br/>from the provisions of this section at the discretion of the<br/>governing board.</p>
