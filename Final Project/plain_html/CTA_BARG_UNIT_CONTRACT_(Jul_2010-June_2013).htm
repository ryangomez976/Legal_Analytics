<p>ARTICLE I: AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) by and between the Shasta County Superintendent of<br/>Schools (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Employer&quot;) and the Shasta County Certificated<br/>Employees Association, CTA/NEA (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Association”). This<br/>Agreement supersedes all previous agreements between the parties. This Agreement<br/>is contingent upon ratification without condition by the Employer and the Association.</p>
<p>ARTICLE II: RECOGNITION</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer confirms its recognition of the Association as the exclusive<br/>representative for that unit of certificated employees certified by the Public<br/>Employment Relations Board on June 29,1977. This agreement applies only to<br/>certificated County Office employees included in the above representation unit.</p>
<p>ARTICLE III: EMPLOYER RIGHTS</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the Employer retains all of its powers and authority to<br/>direct, manage and control to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer's exercise of its powers, rights, authority, duties and responsibilities;<br/>the adoption of policies, rules, regulations and practices in furtherance thereof; shall<br/>be limited only by the specific and express terms of this Agreement, and then only to<br/>the extent such specific and express terms are in conformance with the law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV: NON-DISCRIMINATION</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer agrees to continue its policy of not illegally discriminating against any<br/>employee in the representation unit. This provision shall be limited to those<br/>circumstances where both of the following apply:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter involved is one within the scope of representation under<br/>Government Code 3543.2, and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discrimination is prohibited under appropriate and applicable federal<br/>and/or state statute(s).</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No grievance shall be processed through the grievance procedure involving this<br/>provision if the grievant pursues any other available legal remedy.</p>
<p>4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to support the Employer's affirmative action program and<br/>practices.</p>
<p>ARTICLE V: EMPLOYEE EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>5.1 PROCEDURES</p>
<p>l</p>
<p>5.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer retains responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of<br/>performance of each employee, subject only to the following procedural<br/>requirements. Accordingly, no grievance filed pursuant to Article VII,</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure, arising under this Article shall challenge the judgment of<br/>the evaluator, nor the content of the evaluation. Any grievances shall be<br/>limited to a claim that the following procedures have been violated. Unit<br/>members shall not evaluate other unit members.</p>
<p>5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and second year employees will be evaluated at least once. After two (2)<br/>years of service employees will be evaluated at least once every two (2)<br/>years. The evaluator shall be the Management Level Supervisor.</p>
<p>5.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each employee to be evaluated during the year shall, prior to October 15,<br/>provide the evaluator written statements setting forth performance objectives<br/>for the assigned job responsibilities. The effect of adverse working conditions<br/>upon an employee's performance shall be considered in setting performance<br/>objectives. No later than November 15, employees to be evaluated will meet<br/>with the evaluator in a planning conference to discuss the elements of evalua¬<br/>tion. If mutual agreement on performance objectives cannot be reached, the<br/>evaluator and evaluate© shall confer with the evaluator's supervisor for<br/>assistance in resolving the disagreement.</p>
<p>5.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who receive an evaluation that is unsatisfactory will be frozen on<br/>the salary schedule in the step column, but will continue to receive column<br/>credits for units. If an employee receives a satisfactory evaluation in any of<br/>the following school years, they will receive step credit and be placed on the<br/>salary schedule step that they would have been on if they had received a<br/>satisfactory evaluation. Step adjustment will be made at the beginning of the<br/>following contract year in which the satisfactory evaluation was received;<br/>there will be no retroactive salary adjustments made for previous years.</p>
<p>Unit members who are denied incremental movement based upon his/her<br/>evaluation may request a meeting with the immediate supervisor of the<br/>administrator who determined the unsatisfactory evaluation, and with local<br/>CTA representation by May 15<sup>th</sup> to discuss if the evaluation determination<br/>was appropriate.</p>
<p>5.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all employees who received below standard competencies evaluation the<br/>prior school year, an interim written evaluation shall be completed, and a<br/>meeting hold between the employee and evaluator, prior to January 15. The<br/>interim written evaluation shall include specific recommendations for improve¬<br/>ment in any previously cited performance deficiencies which have not been<br/>corrected.</p>
<p>5.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By May 1, the evaluator shall complete a final written evaluation for all<br/>employees being evaluated during the year. Prior to preparing the final written<br/>evaluation, the evaluator shall meet with the evaluatee. The evaluator shall</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>meet with each such employee to discuss the evaluation, and shall provide a<br/>copy to the employee. Whenever an employee receives a written evaluation<br/>indicating areas of performance in need of improvement, upon request of the<br/>employee an additional observation shall be conducted followed by another<br/>written evaluation.</p>
<p>5.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) school days following the above final evaluation conference,<br/>the employee may attach to the evaluation any statement the employee<br/>wishes to become a permanent part of the personnel file. The employee may<br/>also discuss the evaluation with the evaluator's supervisor.</p>
<p>5.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative performance evaluation shall be based upon any written or verbal<br/>material of a derogatory nature received by the evaluator from a citizen or a<br/>parent unless the employee has first been given an opportunity to discuss the<br/>matter with the evaluator. Within ten (10) calendar days of notice, the em¬<br/>ployee shall have the right to have written comments attached to such<br/>derogatory material prior to its being placed in the personnel file.</p>
<p>5.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to modifications in the evaluation forms, the employer shall meet and<br/>negotiate with the Association.</p>
<p>5.2 ALTERNATIVE EVALUATION FOR UNIT MEMBERS</p>

<p>5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote openness and encourage creative approaches, it is agreed that a<br/>unit member evaluated under this section shall receive a satisfactory rating.</p>
<p>5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By October 15th, the unit member and the evaluator shall agree to a written<br/>evaluation plan. The parties recognize that an alternative evaluation plan is<br/>intended to be a collaborative undertaking between the unit member and the<br/>supervisor. Input from the district site administrator may be included in this<br/>process. It is not the intention of the parties to restrict innovation and<br/>creativity; therefore, the following options are only examples (details of<br/>evaluation options will be provided to unit members):</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visitation/Co-Visitation: Visitation may include observation of other<br/>teachers' classroom approaches, techniques, training, and/or in-service<br/>activity in or out of the District. Purpose is feedback to unit members.</p>

<p>4</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI: COMPLAINT PROCEDURE</p>
<p>6.1 The appropriate processing of complaints concerning unit members shall be from the<br/>complainant to the unit member, then to the unit member's immediate supervisor,<br/>then to the unit member's division head, then to the Superintendent. (No provision of<br/>this article shall be construed to be a substitute for any other legal authority or<br/>jurisdiction. Time limits specified as a result of other legal authorities or jurisdictions<br/>are not subrogated by the time limits contained in Article 6.2), This shall in no way<br/>pre-empt the unit member's right to file a grievance.</p>
<p>6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any written complaint regarding a unit member shall be reported within thirty (30)<br/>days of the event or the reasonable knowledge of the event. This procedure applies<br/>only to written complaints. If a written complaint is reported to a supervisor after thirty<br/>(30) days of the event, or reasonable knowledge thereof, while the supervisor may<br/>discuss the matter with the unit member, there will be no explicit record of the issue<br/>giving rise to the event placed in the unit member's personnel file. Verbal complaints<br/>need not be reported. Any verbal complaint may be reported to the unit member<br/>upon the discretion of the administrator receiving the complaint, provided; however,<br/>that if the verbal complaint is reported to the unit member, then the following<br/>information shall be provided: the name of the complaining party, the nature of the<br/>complaint, the factual basis for the complaint including but not limited to who was<br/>involved, what occurred, where it occurred and when it occurred, and the names of<br/>any witnesses known at that time.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an administrator receives a complaint regarding a unit member, the<br/>administrator shall direct the complainant to meet with the unit member if they have<br/>not already met, and shall inform the unit member of the complaint. The<br/>Administrator receiving the complaint shall also inform the unit member’s immediate<br/>supervisor of the complaint. If the unit member or complainant refuses to meet, the<br/>unit member's immediate supervisor shall discuss the complaint with the unit member<br/>and the complainant, and take reasonable, appropriate action. (The resolution of<br/>complaints shall be developed to improve employee performance.) If the complaint is<br/>not resolved at the meeting, if any, between the complainant and the unit member,<br/>then either the complainant or the unit member, may request a meeting with the unit<br/>member's immediate supervisor, and if not resolved at that meeting, may request a<br/>meeting with the unit member's division head, and if not resolved at that meeting,<br/>may request a meeting with the Superintendent who shall render a decision<br/>consistent with just cause regarding the complaint.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the complaint shall be provided to the unit member. A unit member may<br/>have representation from the Association. Rumor or unsubstantiated information<br/>shall not be placed in a personnel file. <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>5</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII: GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any grievance which may arise between an employee or the Association and the<br/>Employer with respect to the interpretation or application of any of the terms of this<br/>Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be determined by<br/>the provisions of this Article. In the interest of resolving grievances, the grievance<br/>procedures shall be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate.<br/>Employees may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedures.</p>
<p>7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step One: The initial step in the adjustment of a grievance shall be a discussion<br/>between the Grievant and/or the Grievant’s representative and the immediate<br/>supervisor who will answer within ten (10) work days. This step shall be started<br/>within ten (10) work days of the date of the action complained of, or the date the<br/>Grievant became aware of the incident which is the basis for the grievance.</p>
<p>7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Two: If a grievance is not resolved in the first step, the second step shall be the<br/>presentation of the grievance in writing, by either the Grievant and/or the Grievant's<br/>representative to the appropriate Assistant Superintendent, who shall answer, in<br/>writing, within ten (10) workdays. The second step shall be taken within ten (10)<br/>work days of the date of the answer in Step One. The written presentation shall be a<br/>clear, concise statement of the grievance, the circumstances involved, the pertinent<br/>dates, the decision rendered at the previous step, the section of the Agreement<br/>alleged to be violated, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Three: If a grievance is not resolved in the second step, the third step shall be<br/>the presentation of the grievance in writing by either the Grievant and/or the<br/>Grievant's representative to the Superintendent who shall answer in writing within ten<br/>(10) work days. The third step shall be taken within ten (10) workdays of the date of<br/>the answer in Step Two. The written presentation shall be a clear, concise statement<br/>of the grievance, the circumstances involved, the pertinent dates, the decision ren¬<br/>dered at the previous step, the section of the agreement alleged to be violated, and<br/>the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Four: If a grievance is not resolved in the third step, the fourth step shall be<br/>referral by the Association to mediation within ten (10) work days of the answer in<br/>Step Three, Whenever a grievance is referred to mediation, either party shall request<br/>that the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service refer a State Mediator.<br/>The State Mediator shall assist the parties in the resolution of the grievance in the<br/>same manner as that which is normally used in the mediation of interest disputes.<br/>Referral to Step Five shall not occur until the Mediator has released the parties from<br/>the mediation process.</p>
<p>7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step Five: If a grievance is not resolved in the fourth step, the fifth step shall be<br/>referral by the Association to arbitration within ten (10) work days of the conclusion of<br/>the mediation process. <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>6</p>
<p>7.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Arbitrator shall be appointed on each occasion that a grievance is<br/>submitted to arbitration. In the event that the Employer and the Association<br/>are unable to agree on the selection of an Arbitrator, they shall request the<br/>State of California Mediation and Conciliation Service to nominate five (5)<br/>persons to be the Arbitrator. The Employer and the Association each will<br/>alternately challenge two (2) of such nominees, the party having the first<br/>challenge to be determined by lot. The remaining nominee shall be accepted<br/>as the Arbitrator and the Arbitrator’s compensation and expenses shall be<br/>borne equally by the Employer and the Association. The Employer and the<br/>Association shall pay the compensation and expenses of their respective<br/>appointees and witnesses. At the Association request, the Employer shall<br/>release a reasonable number of employees from duty to participate in<br/>arbitration proceedings. Other expense items such as court reporters,<br/>transcripts, or room rent, shall be borne equally by the parties. ,</p>
<p>7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Arbitrator shall hold such hearings and shall consider such evidence as to<br/>the Arbitrator appears necessary and proper. The decision of the Arbitrator<br/>shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Association and the Grievant,<br/>and shall not in any way add to, disregard or modify any of the provisions of<br/>this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the Grievant to meet any of the aforementioned time limits will result in<br/>forfeiture of the grievance. Except, however, that the aforementioned time limits may<br/>be extended by written mutual agreement. Failure by the Employer to meet any of<br/>the aforementioned time limits will allow the Association to go forward with the<br/>grievance to the next step of the established procedures.</p>
<p>7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may present grievances on the employee's own behalf in accordance<br/>with this Article without the intervention of the Association, so long as the adjustment<br/>is reached prior to arbitration and is not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of<br/>this Agreement and further provided that the Employer shall not agree to a resolution<br/>of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the<br/>proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Grievant shall in no way interfere with the right of the Employer to proceed in<br/>carrying out its management responsibilities subject to a final decision on the<br/>grievance. In the event the grievance involved an order, requirement or other<br/>directive, the Grievant shall fulfill or carry out such order, requirements, or directives,<br/>pending the final decision on the grievance.</p>
<p>7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents resulting from the processing of a grievance shall be filed in a separate<br/>grievance file and shall not be placed in any employee's personnel file. <sup>7</sup></p>
<p>7</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII: ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article protects the rights of individual employees without restricting CTA's right<br/>to require every bargaining unit employee, except those exempt from these<br/>provisions, to pay a fair share of the cost of collective bargaining activities.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as expressly provided herein, all employees in the bargaining unit who do not<br/>maintain membership in good standing in CTA are required, as a condition of<br/>employment, to pay service fees to CTA, in amounts that do not exceed the periodic<br/>dues of CTA, for the duration of this agreement.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee shall be obligated to pay dues or service fees to CTA until the first of<br/>the month following 30 calendar days after the employee first comes into the<br/>bargaining unit.</p>
<p>8.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the Association or who does not<br/>make application for membership in the Association within the thirty (30) days<br/>of the effective date of this Article or within thirty (30) days from the date of<br/>commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit, shall become a<br/>member of the Association or pay to the Association a representation fee in an<br/>amount equal to that amount permitted by law, payable to the Association in<br/>one lump sum cash payment in the same manner as required for the payment<br/>of membership dues, provided, however, that the unit member may authorize<br/>payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as provided in Section 8.9.4<br/>of this Article.</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member shall not pay such fee directly to the<br/>Association, or authorize payment through payroll deduction as provided in<br/>Section 8.3.1 above, the Association may, in writing, request that the Employer<br/>shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in Education<br/>Code Section 45061 and in the same manner as set forth in Section 8.9.1 of<br/>this Article. There shall be no charge to the Association for such mandatory<br/>representation fee deductions.</p>
<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member and the Association are unable to reach agreement on the<br/>manner of payment, the Association shall notify the Employer, in writing, that<br/>the unit member whose pay is to be affected by the deduction has (1) refused<br/>to join the Association and (2) has refused to tender the amount of the<br/>representation fee, the Association shall notify the Employer, in Writing, that (1)<br/>the amount of the fee meets the requirement of law and (2) the Association<br/>has informed the unit members in writing of the Association's procedures for<br/>employees who contest the amount of the fee in accordance with the<br/>regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board. <sup>8</sup></p>
<p>8</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings include objections to joining or paying service fees to employee<br/>organizations shall not be required to join, maintain membership in, or pay service<br/>fees to CTA as a condition of employment. However, such employee shall be<br/>required, in lieu of a service fee required by this agreement, to pay sums equal to<br/>such service fee to one of the following nonreligious, non-labor organization,<br/>charitable funds exempt from taxation under Section 501(c) (3) of Title 26 of the<br/>Internal Revenue Code:</p>

<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members objecting to joining or financially supporting employee organizations<br/>shall provide proof of payment and a written statement of objection along with<br/>verifiable evidence of membership in a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings object to joining or financially supporting employee organizations, pursuant<br/>to Section 8.4 and 8.5 above. Proof of payment shall be in the form of receipts and/or<br/>canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of payment, and to whom payment<br/>in lieu of representation fee has been made. Such proof shall be presented on or<br/>before September 30 of each school year or, in the case of employees hired after<br/>October 31 for the remaining part of the school year, within thirty (30) days of the<br/>commencement of duties.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee organization is authorized to charge any unit member making &quot;in lieu<br/>of payments&quot;, as set forth in Section 8.3.2 and 8.3.3 above in accordance with<br/>Government Code Section 3546.3, and who requests the employee organization to<br/>use the grievance procedure or arbitration procedure on the employee's behalf for the<br/>reasonable cost of such procedures.</p>
<p>8.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REPRESENTATION FEE</p>
<p>8.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representation fee to be collected from non-Association members shall be<br/>the amount authorized by Section 3546.1 (i)(2) of the California Government<br/>Code.</p>

<p>a. Full time, non-exempt bargaining unit members hired during the<br/>school year shall join the Association or pay a prorated representation<br/>fee.

<p>9</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time, non-exempt bargaining unit members shall join the<br/>Association or pay a prorated representation fee on the basis of said<br/>employee's annual salary as compared with the same annual salary for<br/>a comparable full-time employee.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on leave without pay, and unit members who are on<br/>laid-off status shall be exempt from these provisions herein, except that<br/>the election as to membership or payment of a fee as set forth herein<br/>must be exercised within the first ten (10) work days upon return to paid<br/>status.</p>
<p>8.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DUES AND SERVICE FEES DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>8.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CTA has the sole and exclusive right to have employee organization<br/>membership dues and service fees deducted by the employer for<br/>employees in the bargaining unit.</p>
