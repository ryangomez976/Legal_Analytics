<p>Designated PD Davs:</p>
<p>Currently our PD Days occur on Mondays. These days are of value and allow Professional Development<br/>opportunities to be presented on a Districtwide basis. They will continue. However, for instructional<br/>continuity and the convenience of our parents, it makes sense to me to have those seven (7) days occur<br/>on Wednesdays as well. On these days, due to staff needing to travel between sites, our day will<br/>conclude at 3:30 P.M. The 2014-15 designated PD Days will be:</p>

<p>ARTICLE VIII<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>A. The District shall attempt to maintain class size below the state maximum class size<br/>formula. In order to accomplish this goal, the following procedures shall be utilized:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent will publish a quarterly enrollment report which will be made<br/>available to all unit members.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum class sizes for Transitional Kindergarten, Kindergarten and Grades 1-3<br/>shall be as follows (Ed. Code 41376):</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31: Transitional Kindergarten/Kindergarten</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30: Grades 1-3</p>
<p>Beginning with the 2013-14 school year and continuing through such time as the<br/>Local Control Funding Formula is fully implemented, which is estimated to be the<br/>2020-21 school year, the District shall strive to reduce class sizes in grades TK-3<br/>toward the 24:1 target set by the California Legislature.</p>
<p>When any individual class size exceeds thirty-two (32) at all fourth (4<sup>th</sup>) through<br/>sixth (6<sup>th</sup>) grade, an administrator will meet with the respective unit member to<br/>review a plan pursuant to Section A.3. below.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When any individual class size exceeds thirty-two (32) at all fourth (4<sup>th</sup>) through<br/>sixth (6<sup>th</sup>) grade, an administrator will meet with the respective unit member to<br/>review a plan as outlined in a-c below.</p>
<p>The plan may include the following but is not limited to:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of students from the classroom.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment of additional personnel.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit on the number of students in the classroom.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Grades 4-6, when a class size reaches thirty-three (33) students for twenty (20)<br/>consecutive school days, the District shall:</p>
<p>(a) Provide the teacher with a $500.00 one-time stipend to be paid according to the<br/>District’s pay cycle deadlines.</p>
<p>In Grades 4-6, when an individual class size average exceeds thirty-three (33) for a<br/>period of time after the mid-point of the student instructional days and the last<br/>instructional day, the District shall:</p>
<p>(a) The teacher shall receive a $500 stipend to be paid according to the District’s<br/>pay cycle deadline at year end.</p>
<p>Rev. January 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE VIII</p>
<p>-18-</p>
<p>In Grades 4-6, the number of students enrolled in each class shall not exceed<br/>thirty- four (34) students unless mutually agreed upon by the District and unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>5. The District recognizes that combination classes create unique and challenging<br/>classrooms. As such, the District will attempt to minimize the number of<br/>combination classes through a variety of strategies. If a combination class is<br/>needed, based on pupil distribution at a particular school site, the District shall<br/>provide the teacher with one(l) of the following options:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) hours of in-classroom paraprofessional support time daily, or</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stipend of $1000.00 for the academic year</p>
<p>B. Exceptions to class size goals:</p>
<p>Certain classes may be conducive to larger or smaller class size than indicated in<br/>paragraph A above. Included in, but not limited to this exception, are physical education,<br/>band, chorus, etc. and some remedial classes.</p>

<p>L. Family Care Leave</p>
<p>A unit member shall be entitled to family care leave provided by law and shall retain all<br/>rights and privileges granted by law arising out of the use of family care leave.</p>
<p>Unit members who have completed one year of service (under a minimum 60%<br/>contract) during the previous school years for the District, have the right to request<br/>unpaid leave of absence for up to twelve work weeks within a twelve-month period.<br/>Such Family Care Leave must be for the purposes of birth/placement of a child for<br/>adoption/foster care, or for a serious health condition of the unit member’s spouse,<br/>parent and/or child, as well as for the serious health condition of the unit member, which<br/>condition is sufficient to make the unit member unable to perform the functions of the<br/>unit member’s position (except as to pregnancy, birth, or related medical conditions).</p>
<p>There is no carry-over of unused Family Care Leave from one twelve-month period to<br/>the next twelve-month period.</p>
<p>“Parent” means a biological, foster or adoptive parent, a stepparent, a legal guardian, or<br/>other person who stood in loco parentis to the unit member when the unit member was a<br/>child. “Child” means a biological, adopted or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or<br/>child of a person standing in loco parentis who is either under 18 years of age or adult<br/>dependent child incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.</p>
<p>If spouses who are entitled to Family Care Leave under this contract are both employed<br/>by the District, the aggregate amount of Family Care Leave for birth/adoption/foster<br/>care of a child is twelve work weeks during any twelve-month period.</p>
<p>Unit members are required to provide reasonable advance notice to the District of the<br/>need for Family Care Leave if the need for Family Care Leave is foreseeable. Also, unit<br/>members must make a reasonable effort to schedule planned medical<br/>treatment/supervision so as to avoid disruption to the District’s operations, subject to the<br/>approval of the individual’s health care provider.</p>
<p>The District may require that the need for Family Care Leave due to a serious health<br/>condition, be supported by certification from the health care provider of the individual<br/>requiring care. (Certification about a unit member’s condition must include a statement</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>-26-</p>
<p>that the unit member is unable to perform his/her job function.) Also, if the District has<br/>reason to doubt the validity of the certification, the District, at its expense, may require<br/>and obtain a second and/or third opinion to verify the certification.</p>
<p>Family Care Leave is an unpaid leave of absence. Health insurance coverage shall be<br/>maintained and paid for by the District for the duration of the Family Care Leave, not to<br/>exceed twelve work weeks in a twelve-month period, the same as if the unit member had<br/>not taken such leave. However, the District may recover the premium paid for the unit<br/>member during the Family Care Leave if the unit member fails to return from Family<br/>Care Leave after the period of leave has expired for a reason other than the continuation,<br/>recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition, that entitles the unit member to Family<br/>Care Leave or other circumstances beyond the control of the unit member.</p>
<p>A unit member may elect to use, or the District may require the use of, any other<br/>appropriate paid leave during the period of Family Care Leave. When any available<br/>paid leave is exhausted, the balance of the Family Care Leave is unpaid. However,<br/>pregnancy disability leave is a separate entitlement which is in addition to the unit<br/>member’s right to Family Care Leave. Paid sick leave may not be used, except for the<br/>serious health condition of the unit member, unless the District and the unit member<br/>mutually agree. The Family Care Leave shall become effective on the first day of<br/>absence and shall run concurrently with any other paid or unpaid leaves of absence.</p>
<p>Family Care Leave under this section shall not constitute a break in service for purposes<br/>of longevity, seniority or any employee benefit plan. Further, the unit member is<br/>entitled to retain his/her employee status with the District and return with no less<br/>seniority than he/she had at the beginning of the Family Care Leave.</p>
<p>Unit members shall be reinstated at the end of the Family Care Leave to the same or an<br/>equivalent position.</p>
<p>Unit members who do not qualify for Family Care Leave shall maintain all other leave<br/>rights designated in the Agreement.</p>
<p>M. Sick Leave to Attend Family (Labor Code #233)</p>
<p>Unit members shall be entitled to use in any calendar year the unit members’ accrued<br/>and available sick leave entitlement, in an amount of five (5) days per calendar year, to</p>
<p>attend to an illness of a child, parent, or spouse of the employee. All conditions and<br/>restrictions placed by the District upon the use by a unit member of sick leave also shall<br/>apply to the use by a unit member of sick leave to attend to an illness of his/her child,<br/>parent, or spouse.</p>
<p>“Child” means biological, foster, or adopted child, a step child, a legal ward, or a child<br/>of a person standing in loco parentis. “Parent” means a biological, foster, or adoptive<br/>parent, a step parent, or a legal guardian. “Sick Leave” is defined in Article IX, Section</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>-27-</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>No employer shall deny a unit member the right to use sick leave, or discharge, threaten<br/>to discharge, demote, suspend, or in any manner discriminate against an employee for<br/>using, or attempting to exercise the right to use, sick leave to attend to an illness of a<br/>child, parent, or spouse of the unit member.</p>
<p>Unit members shall have the right to file a complaint against the District with the Labor<br/>Commissioner pursuant to Labor #233(e) in addition to Article XI, Grievance<br/>Procedures.</p>
