<p>3.2 Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>The District provides fringe benefits to unit members and their dependents as<br/>set forth below. The District also provides fringe benefits to domestic<br/>partners of unit members, subject to the requirements, verification, etc. of the<br/>benefit carriers.</p>
<p>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;term of this Agreement, the District shall pay the full</p>
<p>premium cost for dental and vision coverage for full-time unit<br/>members, and their dependents.</p>
<p>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2013 calendar year, the District shall pay for any<br/>premium increase beyond the 2012 premium up to 5%. Any<br/>difference will be deducted from the unit member’s paycheck.</p>
<p>For the 2013-14 fiscal year and the 2014-15 fiscal year,<br/>benefits shall be reopened for negotiations (note: Benefit year<br/>correspondence with calendar year not fiscal year).</p>
<p>3.2.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of the application of section 3.2.2 is as<br/>follows:</p>
<p>♦♦♦ If the hypothetical monthly premium in 2012 is<br/>$500;</p>
<p>♦♦♦ And the premiums increase by 10% for 2013 to<br/>raise the new monthly premium to $550;</p>
<p>♦♦♦ The District would assume the first 5% of the<br/>10% premium increase;</p>
<p>♦♦♦ Therefore, the District’s 2013 monthly<br/>contribution would increase to $525 ($500 X<br/>5% = $25) and the employee would contribute<br/>the remaining $25 per month; and<br/>❖ The $525 District contribution level would</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>become the new base.</p>

<p>5.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>5.5.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;served&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than 12 months</p>
<p>with the District, and who have served at least 1250<br/>hours of work service (178.5 days of full time service)<br/>with the District during the previous twelve-month<br/>period are eligible for Family Care and Medical Leave<br/>in accordance with state and federal law. If both parents<br/>of a child work for the District, their Family Care and<br/>Medical Leave related to the birth or placement of their<br/>child shall be limited to a total of twelve (12) weeks.</p>
<p>5.5.1.3 A unit member on Family Care and Medical Leave<br/>under this Section may use any accrued leave or other<br/>paid leave or may elect to take it as unpaid leave. If a<br/>member takes such a leave because of the employee's<br/>own serious health condition, the employee shall<br/>substitute accrued sick leave during the period of the<br/>leave.</p>
<p>5.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duration</p>
<p>5.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section may be taken for a total of</p>

<p>member's group health insurance coverage including<br/>dental and vision shall be maintained by the District at<br/>the same level and under the same conditions as</p>
<p>coverage would have been provided if the employee<br/>had continued in employment continuously for the<br/>duration of the leave.</p>
<p>5.5.4</p>
<p>5.5.3.2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance of Status. The employee shall retain</p>
<p>his/her status with the District during the Family Care<br/>and Medical Leave period, and the leave shall not<br/>constitute a break in service for purposes of longevity<br/>or seniority. For purposes of layoff or recall, the<br/>employee returning from Family Care and Medical<br/>Leave shall return with no less seniority than he/she had<br/>when the leave began.</p>

<p>An employee who takes leave has no greater right to<br/>reinstatement than if he/she had been continuously<br/>employed during the leave period. If the District<br/>reduces its workforce during the leave period, and the<br/>employee is laid off for legitimate reasons at that time,<br/>he/she is not entitled to reinstatement, provided the<br/>District has no continuing obligations under a collective<br/>bargaining agreement or otherwise.</p>

<p>5.5.5.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date on which the serious health condition<br/>commenced.</p>
<p>5.5.5.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probable duration of the condition.</p>
<p>5.5.5.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is requesting leave to care for a<br/>child, spouse or parent who has a serious health<br/>condition, the health care provider's certification<br/>of both of the following:</p>
<p>5.5.5.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated amount of time the health care<br/>provider believes the employee needs to<br/>care for the child, parent or spouse.</p>
<p>5.5.5.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement that the serious health<br/>condition warrants the participation of a<br/>family member to provide care during a<br/>period of the treatment or supervision of<br/>the child, parent or spouse.</p>
<p>5.5.5.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is requesting leave because of<br/>his/her own serious health condition, the health<br/>care provider's certification, that due to the<br/>serious health condition, the employee is unable<br/>to perform the functions of his/her job.</p>
<p>5.5.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this leave is needed for a planned medical treatment</p>
<p>or supervision, the employee shall make a reasonable<br/>effort to schedule the treatment or supervision to avoid</p>
<p>disruption of District operations. This scheduling shall<br/>be subject to the health care provider's approval.</p>
<p>5.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the member is requesting leave for intermittent</p>
<p>treatment or is requesting leave on a reduced leave<br/>schedule for planned medical treatment, the<br/>certification must also state the medical necessity for<br/>the leave, the dates on which treatment is expected to<br/>be given, the duration of such treatment, and the<br/>expected duration of the leave.</p>
<p>5.5.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional leave is needed when the time estimated</p>
<p>by the health care provider expires, the District may<br/>require the member to provide re-certification of the<br/>need for the leave specified above.</p>
<p>5.5.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District has reason to doubt the validity of a</p>
<p>certification that accompanies a request for leave, the<br/>District may challenge the certification and require the<br/>unit member to obtain, at District expense, a second<br/>opinion from a District-approved health care<br/>practitioner not regularly employed by the District. If<br/>the second opinion is contrary to the first, the District<br/>may require, again at District expense, that the unit<br/>member obtain a third medical opinion from a third<br/>health care practitioner approved by both the unit<br/>member and the District.</p>

<p>Reasons for Administrative Transfer or Reassignment</p>
<p>Administrative transfers or reassignment may be made for one<br/>of the following three (3) reasons:</p>

<p>Administrative transfer or reassignment may be made<br/>and shall be based exclusively on the educationally-<br/>related needs of the District.</p>
<p>6.4.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers shall be considered first but are not<br/>automatically entitled to the position.</p>
<p>6.4.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer may be made to meet State<br/>compliance requirements and/or because a<br/>specialized credential is required. Upon request,<br/>the unit member shall be granted two (2) days of<br/>paid service without teaching duties within the<br/>first two (2) weeks of the new assignment to<br/>prepare and Four Hundred Dollars ($400.00) for<br/>instructional materials.</p>

<p>41</p>
<p>6.4.1.2</p>
<p>Over-staffing or relocation of programs</p>
<p>In selecting a unit member to be transferred because a<br/>school is over-staffed, in selecting a unit member to be<br/>reassigned because the District is over-staffed, in<br/>selecting a unit member to be transferred because a<br/>program is being relocated or in implementing primary<br/>class size reduction, the administration shall consider<br/>the following: volunteers; comparability requirements<br/>of State and Federal guidelines; racial-ethnic<br/>background of the school community; educational<br/>school programs; credential requirements; and length of<br/>certificated service in the District. The district shall<br/>consider enrollment fluctuation in making decisions to<br/>relocate staff due to under enrollment prior to<br/>September 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>6.4.1.2.1 Upon request, the unit member shall be granted<br/>two (2) self-directed work days of paid service<br/>without teaching duties within the first two (2)<br/>weeks of the new assignment to prepare and<br/>Four &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundred&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dollars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;($400.00) for</p>
<p>instructional materials.</p>
<p>6.4.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a new teaching setting for certain staff</p>
<p>members</p>
<p>Administrative transfer or reassignment may include<br/>transfer or reassignment as a means of providing a new<br/>teaching setting for a unit member whose performance<br/>has been &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a reemployment</p>
<p>recommendation of &quot;no&quot; or &quot;yes with qualifications.&quot;</p>

Participants who are selected by the<br/>District must obtain approval of their project by the Deputy<br/>Superintendent for Human Resources and the project supervisor.</p>
<p>6.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member accepted into the Early Retirement Program</p>
<p>must resign.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>A unit member must be eligible for California State Teachers’<br/>Retirement System regular retirement benefits.</p>
<p>A unit member must work a minimum of 30 days.</p>

A unit<br/>member not selected may request a conference with the<br/>Superintendent. Participation in the Early Retirement Program is<br/>not an entitlement, but shall be subject to review and<br/>confirmation annually by June 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>Job Sharing</p>
<p>Joint applications for a job-sharing assignment for the<br/>following school year shall be filed with the Deputy<br/>Superintendent for Human Resources Office no later than<br/>March 1. Unit members in a job-sharing assignment must<br/>renew their application each year.</p>

<p>ARTICLE IX:</p>
<p>EVALUATION</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Evaluation of Certificated Personnel</p>
<p>The Mission Statement of the Franklin-McKinley School District reads<br/>as follows:</p>
<p>“The mission of the Franklin-McKinley School District,<br/>as the premier center of diversity, opportunity, and<br/>innovation, is to develop all children into well rounded,<br/>lifelong learners, with a solid academic foundation, and<br/>unlimited capacity to excel and contribute, within<br/>society. This is accomplished by guaranteeing a safe,<br/>nurturing environment that inspires individual<br/>excellence and integrates the strength of our diverse<br/>community.”</p>
<p>If the District is to achieve its goals, it must engage in purposeful and<br/>continuous evaluation of every aspect of its operation. Such an effort<br/>tied to the assessment of needs and the identification of goals, will<br/>serve as a built-in mechanism for constant improvement of the<br/>educational program.</p>
<p>Therefore, evaluation of the District’s certificated personnel should<br/>promote the professional growth and development of all parties<br/>involved in the process, a satisfactory level of staff competency and<br/>performance and assure that strong instructional strategies are being<br/>implemented in every classroom. Evaluation should be an on-going<br/>task with continual feedback to the certificated staff. Those involved<br/>in implementing evaluation are engaged in exchanging perceptions and<br/>hence should approach the task with due modesty, humility and<br/>empathy.</p>
<p>Evaluation of human behavior in any form tends to be highly<br/>subjective. Despite this tendency, the District believes that reasonable<br/>attempts should be made to introduce objectivity into the evaluation<br/>process. To this and, the development of definitive job descriptions is<br/>essential, as are clear and precise statements of instructional<br/>objectives. By measuring performance against such existing bases,<br/>progress may be made toward the objectivity that is desired.</p>
<p>Permanent status (tenure) is granted by the Board of Education to<br/>employees who have successfully completed a probationary period.</p>
<p>Properly implemented, the evaluation process should be:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methods of identifying and recognizing the service of<br/>outstanding certificated staff members.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stimulus for certificated personnel to make conscious<br/>organized efforts to improve professional competence and<br/>performance, thus guaranteeing that each student will benefit<br/>from the service of professionals who constantly strive to<br/>maintain the highest possible standards.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A means for cooperative development and review of mutually<br/>understood standards and criteria for professional service and<br/>pupil growth.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A planned program to keep certificated personnel informed of<br/>their respective strengths and weaknesses and to provide for<br/>appropriate professional growth activities to meet identified<br/>needs.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A method of measuring and predicting employee success,<br/>insuring that capable, qualified, certificated employees<br/>maintain a high level of professional service and continue to<br/>provide a strong educational program for our children.</p>
<p>The Franklin-McKinley School District expects the evaluation of<br/>personnel to be positive in nature. Those responsible for personnel<br/>evaluation are expected to follow orderly methods of identifying<br/>strengths and deficiencies, to suggest and extend assistance for<br/>remediation of deficiencies and to maintain accurate and impartial<br/>records as outlined in the evaluation policy.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relationships</p>
<p>In the Franklin-McKinley School District, certificated evaluation is<br/>based upon a positive relationship between an evaluator and an<br/>evaluatee. The District believes that in order for a successful<br/>evaluation to result there must be mutual respect and confidence<br/>existing between evaluator and evaluatee.</p>
<p>All certificated personnel within the school district are to be evaluated.<br/>The evaluation process will be consistent with applicable California<br/>Education Code provisions. The evaluator of each unit member shall<br/>be an administrator designated by the District, whose identity shall be<br/>established and made known to the employee prior to the first day of<br/>instruction.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>The implementation of these evaluation procedures rests with the<br/>designated administrator. While other certificated staff may be called<br/>upon to assist fellow employees, they will not be required to render<br/>evaluative judgments on an evaluatee's performance.</p>
<p>As a basis for evaluation, an evaluator and evaluatee will jointly agree<br/>on objectives to be used in the evaluation process. The evaluator and<br/>the evaluatee may adjust objectives because of changing conditions in<br/>the job situation.</p>
<p>In order to assure as much objectivity as possible, each evaluation will<br/>be supported by adequate and valid data from which judgments have<br/>been made. If the objectivity of the evaluation is questionable, the unit<br/>member may request a second evaluator through the Human Resources<br/>Administrator.</p>
<p>9.3 Evaluatees Responsibilities</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluatee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will become familiar with the responsibilities</p>
<p>stated in his job description and with specific responsibilities<br/>related to his assignment to a particular school/department.</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school day, the evaluatee will write objectives on</p>
<p>the Certificated Staff Objective Forms in the following areas as<br/>defined by the California Standards for the Teaching<br/>Profession: (or successor designation as mutually agreed to by<br/>the Association and the District).</p>
<p>AREA 1: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and Supporting All Students In</p>
<p>Learning (One required).</p>
<p>AREA 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter</p>
<p>For Student Learning (One required).</p>
<p>AREA 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning Instruction and Designing Learning</p>
<p>Experiences for all Students (One required).</p>
<p>AREA 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and Maintaining Effective</p>
<p>Environments For Student Learning (One<br/>required).</p>
<p>AREA 5: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing Student Learning (One required).</p>
<p>AREA 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing As A Professional Educator (One</p>
<p>required).</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Support staff members will be expected to write a comparable<br/>total number of objectives, mutually agreeable with the<br/>evaluator and evaluatee and related to their job descriptions.</p>
<p>Should an evaluatee receive an “IMPROVEMENT NEEDED”<br/>within any area of the most recent evaluation, the evaluator<br/>may require the unit member to participate in the development<br/>of an action plan.</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluatee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrive at agreement on standards of</p>
<p>performance with evaluator. No later than the thirtieth (30th)<br/>instructional day, the evaluator and the evaluatee will meet to<br/>review the evaluatee's written objectives. If an evaluator will<br/>not accept the evaluatee's objectives, the unit member may<br/>appeal to the Human Resources Administrator.</p>
<p>9.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluatee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conduct appropriate programs for meeting</p>
<p>the objectives agreed upon with the evaluator.</p>
<p>When submitting objectives for District approval, evaluatees<br/>will also identify any necessary teaching materials, which are<br/>not available at the time of writing, including: a) title of<br/>material; b) vendor; c) cost; and d) availability, including<br/>alternate materials. If the District agrees that the materials are<br/>necessary to meet the objectives, but the materials are not<br/>provided, the objective(s) will be changed.</p>
<p>If an evaluatee determines that he/she is unable to provide an<br/>appropriate instructional program for a student, he/she shall<br/>notify the evaluator in writing. This shall include: a) name of<br/>child; b) date of first recognition of problem; c) outline of steps<br/>taken, including requested and provided support services; d)<br/>dates of parent conferencing; e) identified learning modality; f)<br/>attendance record. The evaluatee will initiate a meeting with<br/>the evaluator within ten (10) days of recognition for the<br/>purpose of establishing alternate objectives for said child.</p>
<p>9.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluatee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;submit documentation of progress toward</p>
<p>meeting objectives and will complete the &quot;Assessment of<br/>Results&quot; section of the Certificated Staff Objective Form<br/>(Appendix D)</p>
<p>9.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluatee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet with the evaluator in order to review</p>
<p>the achievement of instructional objectives and other evaluatee<br/>responsibilities.</p>

</table>
<p>9.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will include continuing review with all certificated</p>

<p>At least one-half (1/2) of the objectives must be written for<br/>completion no later than (30) days prior to the final evaluation<br/>date. For the objective(s) not yet completed, the evaluatee<br/>shall present a summary of the steps taken toward completion<br/>of the objective(s).</p>
<p>During the school year, each teaching employee to be<br/>evaluated that year will receive a minimum of two (2)<br/>classroom observations by the evaluator. These observations<br/>are not to occur on the first two or last two instructional days of<br/>the employee’s assigned track, or on the two days before or<br/>after a school break period of at least five (5) instructional<br/>days. In addition, these observations should not occur on the<br/>third though fifth days at the beginning of, or before the end of<br/>the employee’s assigned track. If an observation is conducted<br/>during this period (i.e., the third through firth day at the<br/>beginning of or before the end of the track), and any concerns<br/>are noted in the observation, the evaluator shall note whether<br/>such concerns may be attributable to the time period in which<br/>the observation occurred. None of the time limitations set forth<br/>in this section apply to or in any manner limit when a post<br/>observation conference may be held.</p>
<p>Prior to the observation, a pre-observation conference<br/>between the evaluatee and administrator can occur, and<br/>is recommended. The pre-observation conference must<br/>occur if either party requests it.</p>
<p>Within three days of the observation, the evaluator will<br/>give evaluatee a copy of the observation form<br/>containing the descriptors that were observed in the<br/>observation.</p>
<p>Within five days of the observation, both parties will<br/>meet for a post-observation conference. Both parties<br/>will complete, collaboratively, the post observation<br/>form.</p>
<p>Every probationary certificated staff member will be evaluated<br/>by his immediate supervisor in writing at least twice each<br/>school year, no later than the last instructional day in<br/>December and no later than March 1. Permanent employees<br/>shall be evaluated at least once every other year. Those to be<br/>evaluated will be notified by the evaluator prior to the first day<br/>of instruction. Permanent employees may be evaluated at any<br/>time during the school year if, in the opinion of the evaluator.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>the employee’s performance merits an “IMPROVEMENT<br/>NEEDED” or “UNSATISFACTORY” rating in any area.<br/>Permanent employees to be evaluated will be evaluated at least<br/>thirty (30) days before the end of the school year. The<br/>Progress/Summary Evaluation Form will be used for all<br/>evaluations. Staff scheduled for evaluation will submit<br/>“Certificated Staff Objective Forms” (see Appendix D to this<br/>Agreement). Staff not being evaluated are encouraged to<br/>submit individual or grade/departmental objectives and are<br/>encouraged to meet with the administrator to review the<br/>employee’s objectives.</p>
<p>9.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is unsatisfactory in three (3) out of five (5)</p>
<p>indicators in one of the following areas; Engaging and<br/>Supporting all Students in Learning/Understanding and<br/>Organizing Subject Matter for Students Learning/Planning<br/>Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for all<br/>Students, the evaluatee will become a referred participating<br/>teacher in the PAR Program and will be provided the<br/>evaluator’s specific action plan.</p>
<p>All areas marked UNSATISFACTORY must be fully<br/>explained in the “Comment” section. If the recommendation is<br/>being made for non-employment or reemployment with<br/>qualifications, the evaluator must indicate which area of the<br/>evaluation is the basis for this recommendation.</p>
<p>9.5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of an evaluatee’s competence will not include the</p>
<p>use of publisher’s norms established by standardized tests.</p>

<p>part of the unit member's evaluation:</p>
<p>The complaint must be reported to the staff member by<br/>the administrator in a timely manner. If the complaint<br/>is written, a copy will be given to the employee.</p>
<p>The staff member against whom the complaint is made<br/>may seek legal counsel or representation.</p>
<p>The administration will make an investigation of the<br/>complaint and review its findings with the employee.</p>
<p>In the process of the investigation of the complaint, the<br/>employee will be consulted and given the opportunity<br/>to be heard.</p>
<p>Only a complaint, which has been verified by the<br/>District, may be placed in the employee's personnel file,<br/>in which case the employee may submit a written<br/>response to be attached to the complaint.</p>

<p>(6) areas of evaluation specified in the California Standards for<br/>the Teaching Profession and should reflect the degree to which<br/>the evaluatee is fulfilling the requirements of his/her<br/>assignment. In special cases, a performance task listed on the<br/>evaluation form may not apply to the evaluatee. In those<br/>situations, the evaluator will use the term “not applicable” or<br/>“N/A”. Conversely, there may be special situations in which<br/>performance tasks will be added to the form because of the<br/>nature of the certificated assignment.</p>
<p>The evaluator will check each of the applicable items, rating<br/>the evaluatee’s performance in one (1) of three (3) categories.</p>

<p>The objective and the action plans are used as a means to<br/>achieve desired outcomes. At the time the performance<br/>objectives are developed and agreed upon, it is necessary to<br/>also discuss and agree on the actions and the efforts to be taken<br/>to attain the objectives. The &quot;Certificated Staff Objective<br/>Form&quot; is prepared so that both staff member and supervisor<br/>understand what is to be done, the outcome desired and the<br/>method of measurement that will be used to determine whether<br/>the objective has been attained.</p>

<p>10.2.2.1 Step I</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within twelve (12) days after the grievant knew,<br/>or by reasonable diligence could have known, of<br/>the occurrence of an act or omission giving rise<br/>to the occurrence, the grievant must present the<br/>grievance to the immediate supervisor in writing<br/>on the appropriate form.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall be a clear, concise<br/>statement of the grievance, the circumstances<br/>involved, the decision rendered at the informal<br/>conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the request of the grievant, there shall be a<br/>conference between the supervisor and the<br/>grievant within five (5) days. The supervisor<br/>shall communicate his decision to the grievant<br/>in writing within ten (10) days after receiving<br/>the grievance.

<p>Arbitration</p>
<p>10.2.3.1 Step III</p>
<p>If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance at Step II, the Association may within eight</p>
<p>(8) days submit the grievance to arbitration and shall<br/>notify the Superintendent in writing.</p>
<p>a. The Association and the District shall attempt to<br/>agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement can be<br/>reached, the parties shall request the State<br/>Conciliation Service or the American<br/>Arbitration Association to supply a panel of five</p>
<p>(5) names of persons experienced in hearing<br/>grievances in public schools. Each party shall<br/>alternately strike a name until only one (1) name<br/>remains. The remaining panel member shall be<br/>the arbitrator. The order of striking shall be<br/>determined by lot.</p>
<p>b. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be<br/>borne equally by the District and the<br/>Association. All other expenses shall be borne<br/>by the party incurring them.

<p>67</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parties cannot agree upon a submission<br/>agreement, the arbitrator shall determine the<br/>issues by referring to the written grievance and<br/>the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the District nor the aggrieved shall be<br/>permitted to assert any grounds or evidence<br/>before the arbitrator, which was not previously<br/>disclosed to the other party. The arbitrator shall<br/>consider only those issues, which have been<br/>carried through prior steps as required by the<br/>provisions of the procedure.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to add to,<br/>subtract from or modify the terms of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and<br/>shall set forth the arbitrator's findings of fact,<br/>reasoning and conclusions on the issues<br/>submitted. The arbitrator shall be without the<br/>power or authority to make any decision, which<br/>requires the commission of an act, prohibited by<br/>law or which is violative of the Agreement.<br/>However, it is agreed that the arbitrator is<br/>empowered to include in any award such<br/>financial reimbursement or other remedies<br/>which the arbitrator judges to be proper. The<br/>award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding<br/>on the parties, and a copy shall be submitted to<br/>the Superintendent, the aggrieved, and the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may request the arbitrator to rule on<br/>the arbitrability of a grievance by submitting a<br/>written request to the arbitrator no later than<br/>sixty (60) days prior to the scheduled date of the<br/>arbitration hearing. A copy shall be sent to the<br/>Association simultaneous. The Association shall<br/>have an opportunity to respond in writing to the<br/>District’s request within fifteen (15) days of<br/>service of the District’s request. The arbitrator<br/>shall have the discretion to rule on the<br/>arbitrability of the grievance either before the<br/>hearing commences or at the conclusion of the<br/>hearing. If the arbitrator rules on the arbitrability</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>of the grievance before the hearing commences,<br/>he/she shall issue his/her ruling no later than<br/>thirty (30) days prior to the date of the<br/>scheduled hearing.</p>

<p>48900.4, or 48900.7 that the pupil engaged in, or is reasonably<br/>suspected to have engaged in, those acts. The district shall provide<br/>the information to the teacher based upon any records that the<br/>district maintains in its ordinary course of business, or receives<br/>from a law enforcement agency, regarding a pupil described in this<br/>section.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A school district, or school district officer or employee, is<br/>not civilly or criminally liable for providing information under this<br/>section unless it is proven that the information was false and that<br/>the district or district officer or employee knew or should have<br/>known that the information was false, or the information was provided<br/>with a reckless disregard for its truth or falsity.</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer or employee of a school district who knowingly<br/>fails to provide information about a pupil who has engaged in, or who<br/>is reasonably suspected to have engaged in, the acts referred to in<br/>subdivision (a) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punishable by<br/>confinement in the county jail for a period not to exceed six months,<br/>or by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.</p>
