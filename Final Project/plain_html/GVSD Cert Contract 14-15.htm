<p>ARTICLE 6</p>
<p>Teacher Support And Evaluation</p>
<p>The purpose of teacher evaluation is to maintain or improve the quality of education in the</p>
<p>district. It is understood and agreed that this objective can be most easily achieved if the</p>
<p>district administrators assist all certificated employees in improving their professional skills.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation and assessment of the performance of each certificated employee shall be<br/>made on a continuing basis as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least once each school year for probationary personnel.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At lease every other year for personnel with permanent status.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At lease every five years for personnel with permanent status who have been<br/>employed at least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, if those personnel<br/>occupy positions that are required to be filled by a highly qualified professional by the<br/>federal No Child left behind Act of 2001 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 6301, et seq.), as defined in 20<br/>U.S. C. Sec. 7801, and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or<br/>exceeding standards, if the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree.<br/>The certificated employee or the evaluator may withdraw consent at any time.<br/>Withdrawal of consent may affect the normal evaluation timeline.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas for teacher evaluation are summarized in the *Certificated Evaluation Criteria<br/>(CEC) form. The *Summative Evaluation is based on the *formal observation process as<br/>well as informal job-related observations held throughout the year. *Informal<br/>observations include, but are not limited to, the evaluator’s observation or knowledge of<br/>the employee’s performance during classroom visitations outside of the formal<br/>observation cycle, playground and duty assignments, staff and parent meetings, and other<br/>assigned school responsibilities.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *Summative Evaluation shall include the following forms:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*CEC form completed by the *evaluator</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional written evaluation by evaluator (optional)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEC form completed by teacher</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Self-evaluation narrative written by the teacher</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual Growth Plan</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other factors in the support and evaluation process include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site principal shall be the administrator responsible for conducting teacher<br/>evaluations at his/her site. At a site with multiple administrators, the site principal<br/>shall be responsible for assigning teachers to specific administrators for evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time during the evaluation cycle, employees may request and, with the<br/>approval of the evaluator, be assigned another administrator in the District to conduct<br/>the evaluation.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation which contains any “*Less than Effective” rating may include the<br/>requirement that the employee participate in a plan/program designed to improve the<br/>appropriate areas(s). All necessary and actual expenses for such a program shall be<br/>paid by the District. Teachers shall not be required to attend such programs outside of<br/>the regularly contracted school year, days and hours (with up to one hour additional<br/>travel time each way for regional programs) without the mutual consent of the teacher<br/>and the site principal.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6 (continued)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation which contains an overall “*Less than Effective” rating shall include<br/>the requirement that the employee participate in a plan/program designed to improve<br/>the appropriate area(s) as specified in the ^Remediation Plan. All necessary and actual<br/>expenses for such a program shall be paid by the District. Teachers shall not be<br/>required to attend such programs outside of the regularly contracted school year, days<br/>and hours (with up to one hour additional travel time each way for regional programs)<br/>without the mutual consent of the teacher and the site principal.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a *permanent employee has received an overall “*Less than Effective” evaluation,<br/>he/she shall be evaluated annually until he/she achieves an *effective evaluation or is<br/>separated from the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process will be modified to better meet the job descriptions of district<br/>psychologists and district nurses. Classroom observations as described in the<br/>flowchart will not be used. An alternative summative evaluation form will be used in<br/>place of the CEC form. All other processes described in the flowchart will be<br/>employed.</p>
<p>* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All asterisked items in this article and tlie accompanying flowchart are defined in the glossary.</p>
<p>E. Behavior, which may require immediate corrective action:</p>
<p>If an administrator has concerns about an employee’s job behavior or performance that</p>
<p>require immediate cessation or modification, the following steps shall be followed within</p>
<p>three working days of a specific incident, observation or notification. Incidents of a</p>
<p>serious nature may result in the by passing of one or more of these steps.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verbal warning</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written warning</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written reprimand (to be placed in the employee’s personnel file)</p>

<p>Personnel Files</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials in personnel files of employees, which may serve as a basis for affecting the<br/>status of their employment, are to be made available for the inspection of the person<br/>involved.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such material is not to include ratings, reports, or records which:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were obtained prior to the employment of the person involved.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 8</p>
<p>Assignment and Transfer</p>
<p>Assignments</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An assignment is defined as a specific position within a school. Whether or not an<br/>opening at any given school is available, teachers wishing to request a reassignment may<br/>complete a “Request for New Assignment” form, which will be made available in each<br/>school. The completed form may be given to the site principal at any time and will be<br/>kept on file through February of the following year. A teacher may place a copy in his/her<br/>personnel file.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignments may be voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary assignments will be solicited<br/>and considered by the principal before involuntary consistent with “A” above. Requests<br/>for reassignment may originate with the employee or the principal, and will be given full<br/>consideration in light of the best interests of the employee, school and district.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary assignment or reassignment may be made by the principal and/or<br/>superintendent if deemed to be in the best interest of the school or district. Involuntarily<br/>reassigned teachers may request and shall receive written and/or verbal explanation.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will consider all applications and make the final decision. The principal<br/>shall consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria in making a reassignment<br/>decision:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority, number of times requesting the assignment, and prior number of<br/>reassignments will be strongly considered in determining reassignments and<br/>transfers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best interests of students</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special qualifications needed</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance among the staff</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smooth functioning of the school</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other criteria related to the specific position</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing that reassignments can be traumatic for the staff involved, it is the intent of<br/>this contract to set guidelines and procedures that treat all staff consistently, that<br/>effectively communicate openings, and that inform staff members of a reassignment at<br/>the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>Once it is determined that an opening exists, the principal shall post the opening in a<br/>designated area. An opening exists when the principal does not initiate an<br/>assignment/reassignment to fill a particular position (the principal may make several<br/>reassignments before a position is declared open). Teachers will be notified of a<br/>reassignment at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a teacher has been notified of a reassignment, he or she will be given assistance and<br/>support for the new assignment. These may include, but not be limited to: being assigned<br/>a mentor, visiting other classrooms, attending seminars relevant to the new assignment as<br/>well as meeting and planning with teachers in the new grade level or assignment.<br/>Administrators and re-assigned teachers shall utilize the “Assignment Support Form” as a<br/>means of supporting the reassigned teachers.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who submitted a “Request for a New Assignment” form may request and shall<br/>receive a verbal or written explanation for the principal’s final decision.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8 (continued)</p>
<p>Transfers</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer is defined as a change in work site(s) within the district. Should an employee<br/>of the Grass Valley School District request a transfer to another school within the district<br/>the following process shall be in place to facilitate the employee’s interest in changing<br/>work sites, and the district’s interest in filling the opening in a timely manner.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees interested in a transfer to another site should complete a Request for Transfer<br/>form even if no positions are currently available. An opening exists when the<br/>superintendent does not initiate a transfer to fill a particular position (the Superintendent<br/>may make several transfers before a position is declared open).</p>
<p>Except when there are circumstances, which require immediate action, the district agrees<br/>to announce its intent to fill specific openings. A copy of such announcements shall be<br/>posted at each school and the District Office in a designated area, and a copy shall also be<br/>forwarded to the Association President. Outside advertising may occur concurrently with<br/>the internal posting. Except in an emergency situation, openings will be posted a<br/>minimum of one week before the filing deadline. Additionally, the superintendent shall<br/>endeavor to notify staff of areas of future openings whenever possible.</p>
<p>The superintendent, after consulting with principals, will consider all current employees<br/>expressing interest in an opening prior to interviewing outside candidates.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for Transfer forms shall be available to employees at each school site.<br/>The completed form should be given to the Superintendent. The form may be submitted<br/>at any time. All forms will be kept on file through the following February. After that time,<br/>the employee must resubmit another form if still desiring a transfer.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an opening has been determined and not been filled by the Superintendent, a site<br/>committee shall be formed at the school in which the opening is located. The committee<br/>shall include the principal and teachers from the site.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each site committee shall require outside candidates to be interviewed and teach a model<br/>lesson. The interview and model lesson are optional for interested in-house employees.<br/>All interested in-house candidates are to be considered by the site committee whether or<br/>not they have requested an interview' or taught a model lesson.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal shall have the final say regarding the committee’s recommendation.<br/>Employees who are not selected may request and shall receive a verbal or written<br/>explanation of the final decision from the site principal.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether an open position at a school will be filled by a transfer from<br/>another school site or an outside hire, every effort will be made to honor teachers’<br/>requests for transfer. However, other factors will also need to be taken into consideration,<br/>such as the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best interest of the district</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best interest of students</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special qualifications needed</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance among staff</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other criteria related to the specific position</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall consider voluntary before involuntary transfers for openings.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall have authority to initiate or negate any and all transfers if in<br/>his/her opinion it is in the best interest of the district.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a teacher has been notified of a transfer, he or she will be given assistance and<br/>support for the new assignment. These may include, but not be limited to: visiting other<br/>classrooms, attending seminars relevant to the new assignment as well as meeting and<br/>planning with teachers in the new grade level or assignment.</p>

<p>Leaves of Absence</p>
<p>Sick Leave</p>
<p>Each employee shall be entitled to ten (10) days paid sick leave for each year of employment.<br/>Unused sick leave shall accrue from school year to school year. Sick leave entitlement shall<br/>be prorated for part-time employees. Sick leave may be utilized for absence due to employee<br/>illness or injury and medically related appointments. Sick leave may also be utilized to attend<br/>to a serious illness or injury of a child, parent, spouse, or domestic partner as defined in<br/>California Labor Code 233 and Title 29. (12/05/02)</p>
<p>For the purposes of this section, the law defines “serious illness or injury” as</p>
<p>1) inpatient care, 2) continuing treatment for at least three consecutive days which requires<br/>the treatment of a health care provider. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common<br/>cold, the flu, ear infections, upset stomach, dental problems, etc. do not meet the definition of<br/>a serious illness. (12/05/02)</p>
<p>Extended Illness Leave</p>
<p>After all earned sick leave days at full pay have been used and additional absence due to<br/>illness or injury is necessary, an employee shall receive the difference between his/her own<br/>salary and the amount paid to his/her substitute for a total of five (5) school months or one<br/>hundred (100) days. Differential pay also applies when a substitute is not employed.</p>
<p>To be eligible for such leave and the accompanying differential pay when absent due to<br/>illness or injury during the five-month period, an employee may be required to provide<br/>written medical verification for absence. There shall be one 100-day differential period per<br/>school year, which is non-cumulative.</p>
<p>Pregnancy Disability Leave</p>
<p>Any employee may utilize accumulated sick leave for the purpose of a disability related to<br/>pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth and the recovery there from. The length of such leave,<br/>including the date on which the leave shall commence and the date of which the unit member<br/>shall resume duties, shall be determined by the unit member and the unit member’s<br/>physician, provided that such verification demonstrates that such leave is for disability and is<br/>not for the purposes of child care or any purpose other than pregnancy-related disability. Such<br/>pregnancy disability leave with pay shall be granted and administered in the same manner as<br/>sick leave and extended illness leave provisions of the Agreement.</p>
<p>Industrial Accident and Illness Leave:</p>
<p>Employees are eligible for leave of absence because of industrial accident or illness, which<br/>the District’s industrial accident insurance carrier considers a valid claim. Allowable leaves<br/>shall not be for more than sixty (60) service days in any one (1) fiscal year for the same<br/>accident and shall commence the first day of absence.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave authorized under this section shall not accumulate.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event an employee’s period of absence while receiving benefits under this<br/>section enters a new school year, such employee shall be eligible only for that portion<br/>of the original benefit, which was not utilized in the first year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits provided in this section are in addition to sick leave benefits. Accordingly,<br/>the Board shall not deduct accumulated sick leave from the sick leave allotment of an<br/>employee who is absent under authority of this section.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10 (continued)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total of an employee’s temporary disability benefits and the portion of salary due<br/>him/her during the absence shall equal but not be more than the full salary.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determination of any employee’s eligibility for benefits authorized shall be with the<br/>District’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall endorse and present to the District any warrants, which represent<br/>payments for jury service. The mileage portion will be returned to the employee.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee is released from jury duty prior to 12:00 noon of an instructional day,<br/>the employee shall return to the District to resume his/her normal afternoon duties, or<br/>other tasks as assigned by the principal.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee is requested to appear in court under subpoena or judicial mandate,<br/>he/she shall be released from duty under this provision of the Agreement.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>Each employee shall be entitled to use up to eight (8) days of his/her accumulated sick</p>
<p>leave allotment during any school year in case of personal necessity. Earliest possible<br/>notification shall be given. “Personal Necessity” is defined as:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the employee’s immediate family</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving the person or property of the employee or the person or property<br/>of the employee’s immediate family</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inability to get to assigned place of duty due to circumstances beyond employee’s<br/>control</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, after determining the ability to arbitrate the grievance, conduct a<br/>hearing and consider evidence and arguments pertaining to the grievances and submit<br/>a solution.

Nothing shall preclude both<br/>parties from mutually agreeing to shorten or extend any timelines within this level.<br/>Such mutual exceptions shall be in writing.

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by either party against any grievant, any party<br/>directly involved, the District, any member of the Local Association, or any other<br/>participant in the grievance procedure.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition: Catastrophic leave may be available for employee illness, or health reasons<br/>affecting a member of the employee’s immediate family (“Immediate Family” is defined<br/>as the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather or a grandchild of the employee or of the<br/>spouse of the employee; and the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law,<br/>brother, sister or member of the immediate household of the employee) which require the<br/>employee to take extended time off from work (12 consecutive days or more).<br/>Catastrophic leave is paid leave of absence which may only be used for verifiable, long<br/>term illness or injury (physician verification shall be required) such as, but not limited to,<br/>accident, cancer or heart attack which clearly disables the employee or family member.<br/>(Ed. Code 44043.5)</p>

As catastrophic leave is drawn, one day shall<br/>be subtracted from each person on the list in turn. All persons on the list shall donate one<br/>day before the person at the top of the list donates a second day. Donated time will be<br/>subtracted from the donating employees accumulated sick leave.

<p>Article 24</p>
<p>Organizational Security - Agency Fee</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</p>
<p>With the passage of SB 1960 in 2000, the Grass Valley School District is required to<br/>collect an “Agency Fee” from any bargaining unit member of the Grass Valley Teachers’<br/>Association (GVTA) who has elected not to join and pay dues to the Grass Valley<br/>Teachers’ Association/Califomia Teachers’ Association/National Educators’ Association<br/>(GVTA/CTA/NEA). A bargaining unit member is defined as any certificated employee<br/>who is represented by GVTA. The only exception is a unit member, who for reasons of<br/>religion and/or conscience, elects to pay an equal fee to one of the charitable<br/>organizations that is listed in this article. Beginning in the 2001/02 school year, unit<br/>members will, therefore, have three options: 1) join or continue membership in<br/>GVTA/CTA/NEA; 2) pay an Agency Fee to GVTA/CTA/NEA; or 3) pay a like fee to a<br/>recognized charitable organization. Each of these options is described below.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorization for the Deduction of Dues and Fees for GVTA/CTA/NEA Membership<br/>Any unit member, who is applying for membership in GVTA/CTA/NEA, shall sign and<br/>deliver to the District an assignment authorizing deduction of unified membership dues,<br/>fees, and general assessment in the Association. Pursuant to authorization, the District<br/>shall deduct one tenth (1/10) of such dues, fees, and assessments from the regular salary<br/>check of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit members<br/>who are hired after the commencement of the school year, or who decide to change<br/>options after the commencement of the school year (e.g., from Agency Fee to full<br/>membership) shall be appropriately pro-rated to complete payments by the end of the year<br/>(June 30th). Such pro-ration shall be based on dues, fees, and assessments from the date<br/>the unit member began service with the district or filed the necessary forms to change<br/>options and shall begin in the first complete monthly pay period following the date of hire<br/>or the change of deduction.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agency Fee</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty (30) calendar days from the first contract day of each school year, any unit<br/>member who is not a continuing member of GVTA/CTA/NEA, or who has not filed<br/>forms to join GVTA/CTA/NEA, shall pay an Agency Fee, in an amount equal to<br/>unified membership dues, fees, and assessments, to GVTA/CTA/NEA. Such Agency<br/>Fees shall automatically be deducted from the regular salary check of the unit member<br/>in the manner described in Section B above.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who pay an Agency Fee in lieu of membership do not have voting<br/>rights in GVTA/CTA/NEA.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charitable Contribution in Lieu of Service Fee</p>
<p>Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations,<br/>or who objects for reasons of conscience, shall not be required to join or financially<br/>support GVTA/CTA/NEA as a condition of continued employment. Such unit members<br/>shall pay, in lieu of a service fee, a sum equal to unified membership dues, fees, and<br/>assessments to one of the following non-religious, charitable funds exempt from taxation<br/>under Section 501 (c) (3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code:</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way of Nevada C ounty</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grass Valley Schools Foundation for Arts and Science (Old P.L.A.Y.)</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyman Gilmore Band Boosters</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grass Valley School District Parent/Teachers Club (P.T.C.)</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Article 24 (continued)</p>
<p>All contributions to tax exempt charitable organizations under this provision must be<br/>made by payroll deduction. Such deductions shall be pro-rated in the same manner as<br/>described in B above. Donations to the listed charities not made in this manner will not be<br/>credited to the employee as a charitable contribution as described in this section.</p>
<p>Unit members who elect to contribute to a tax-exempt charitable organization in lieu of<br/>membership do not have voting rights in GVTA/CTA/NEA.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnification and Hold Harmless</p>
<p>The Association agrees to pay to the Employer all reasonable legal fees and legal costs<br/>incurred in defending against any court action and/or administrative action challenging<br/>the legality or constitutionality of the agency fee provisions of this Agreement or their<br/>implementation. The Association shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine<br/>whether any such action or proceeding referred to above shall or shall not be<br/>compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political Action</p>

<p>APPENDIX B (continued)</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree that as a result of Stats. 1996, c. 959 (S.B. 98)<br/>section 1, the parties can agree to a salary schedule in which placement is not strictly<br/>governed by uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience. The District<br/>and the Association further agree that in extraordinary circumstances, qualified<br/>candidates are lost because of strict application of the uniformity requirements. This<br/>situation might arise in a specialized area that is difficult to fill or in a general subject<br/>area in which there is a shortage of qualified applicants. In light of the authority granted<br/>by Stats. 1996, c. 959 (S.B. 98) section 1, the District and the Association hereby agree<br/>that when the District Superintendent determines a teaching or other certificated position<br/>of special need exists, the Superintendent may recommend to the Board of Trustees that a<br/>newly hired certificated employee be given placement credit above step 6 on the<br/>certificated salary schedule regardless of their years of eligible experience or be placed on<br/>the salary schedule at an entry level above their years of experience. The maximum<br/>placement for a newly hired employee shall be step 10.</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall determine that all of the following criteria have been met when<br/>making this recommendation to the Board:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Credential Held by the Candidate.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience, background, and other qualifications are deemed by the<br/>Superintendent as necessary to properly fill the needs of the position</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate need to fill the position with most highly qualified candidate.</p>
<p>4. Inability to hire satisfactory employee for the advertised position without<br/>increasing the beginning salary.</p>
<p>The Association hereby agrees that the Superintendent is vested with the unilateral<br/>discretion to determine when a teaching or other certificated position of special need<br/>exists. The application and resulting assessment of the above criteria and the<br/>determination to make a recommendation to the Board invoking this section (“L”) also<br/>shall rest solely with the Superintendent. The Association hereby, knowingly,<br/>intelligently, and expressly waives its right or any individual unit member’s right, to<br/>grieve, file an unfair labor practice charge, or pursue any type of legal action to attack or<br/>remedy the Superintendent’s or Board’s actions under these provisions.</p>
<p>This section (“L.”) shall sunset and be removed from this contract on June 30, 2010,<br/>unless an alternate agreement is made between the-G-V-S-D and the GA-fA prior to<br/>that-time.-(Rc\t.sed-a-s-per-G4-¥Ar-ballot results of 05/01/07) (Sunset Language Removed making this a<br/>regular part of the contract as per GITA ballot results of06/04/10)</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consensus was reached to continue the Summer School stipends, but to reduce the sum to<br/>each teacher to $150. There will be no stipend for Summer School teachers who are using<br/>their regularly assigned classroom for summer school. This modification to item M shall<br/>sunset on June 30, 2012. (BoardApproved 06/14/11)</p>

<p>APPENDIX C</p>
<p>RR 4120</p>
<p>Part-Time Employment Agreement (BoardApproval 06/12/12)</p>
<p>The District’s part-time employee program involves those teachers who work less than full¬<br/>time or teachers who share one full-time equivalent (FTE) assignment. All Certificated<br/>employees as defined in Article H, working part-time, shall be represented by the collective<br/>bargaining agreement with the teacher’s association.</p>
<p>Terms and Conditions:</p>
<p>Certificated employees, with District approval, may elect to reduce their workload from full¬<br/>time to part-time under the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may request to work on a part-time basis, with the approval of the principal<br/>and Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each part-time teacher shall attend all pre-school work days and conference days<br/>listed on the adopted school calendar (full days).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each part-time teacher will attend District-scheduled Back-to-School Night and Open<br/>House.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yard-duty and/or other duty supervision at each school site will be prorated to the<br/>duty time required for full-time teachers.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of professional development, part-time teachers may be required by<br/>their principals to attend monthly staff meetings and to participate in district in-<br/>service day activities. If required to attend, at times in which the employee would not<br/>normally be on duty, compensation will be paid by the District for the additional time<br/>at the employee’s regular daily rate of pay or be provided compensatory time off as<br/>may be agreed upon between the part-time teacher and the principal.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normal substitute procedures will apply in case of illness or absence from duty.</p>
<p>7 Part-time teachers shall develop procedures to ensure clear lines of communications<br/>to all parents, including the scheduling of meetings with parents. The procedures will<br/>be made known to the school principal.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first teaching day of school, part-time teachers will be present to establish the<br/>program, set classroom standards, and develop a rapport with the students. Part-time<br/>teachers are to assume full responsibility for each student’s program and progress and<br/>for the total classroom and instructional progress.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the overall daily class schedule, instruction program, activities and related<br/>assignments, shall be approved by the principal at the onset of the part-time contract.<br/>The principal and part-time teacher may re-evaluate details at any time.</p>
<p>10 Salary and benefits will be as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of payment shall be determined by the District, and the options<br/>available shall be communicated to the employee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health and vision care premium will be prorated according to the percentage<br/>of the part-time work year. A teacher must pay for health and vision care<br/>premiums for the percent of time the employee does not work, if that is desired.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dental plan premium entitlement will be prorated according to the provisions<br/>of the dental plan.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>APPENDIX C (continued)</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay for Part-time Employees</p>
<p>Part-time teachers, who work 75% or more of the days of the school year, shall<br/>advance on the salary schedule in the same manner as full-time employees. Their<br/>salary shall be prorated for the time actually worked.</p>
<p>Part-time teachers who work less than 75% of the days of the school year but who<br/>work at least half time during the same school year, shall advance on the salary<br/>schedule in the same manner as full-time employees. Their salary shall be<br/>prorated for the time actually worked.</p>
<p>Part-time teachers who work less than half-time and less than 75% of the days of<br/>the school year, shall advance one step on the salary schedule when their year-to-<br/>year accumulated time adds up to 75% a full year of service credit. Such advances<br/>are made only at the beginning of a school year.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave will be prorated according to the part-time work year.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STRS contributions and benefits shall be provided in accordance with STRS<br/>guidelines and regulations.</p>
<p>11. Full-time teachers who are granted at the discretion of the Board.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>Retirement Incentives</p>
<p>The District shall make available on a voluntary basis to members of the Grass Valley<br/>Teachers’ Association bargaining unit four retirement incentive programs. The District does<br/>this in appreciation and recognition of the employee’s many years of quality service to the<br/>children of Grass Valley. Employees may choose to participate in only one program.</p>
<p>A signed letter of resignation and stated interest in any of these programs must be received by<br/>the District by March 1<sup>st</sup> during the final year of service. This date may be waived at the<br/>discretion of the Board of Trustees, for extraordinary circumstances beyond the employee’s<br/>control. The preferred program and option shall be stated in the resignation letter.</p>
<p>Program Descriptions</p>
<p>Program I: Early Incentive Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible employees who retire from active service shall receive a monetary sum equal<br/>to the difference between step four (4) of the certificated salary schedule in the year in<br/>which they retire and the amount of their regular annual salary in their final school<br/>year of employment with the District. As per CalSTRS regulations, the retiree must<br/>wait 180 days from the date of retirement. (Board Approved 03/11/14)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible teachers may elect to receive the retirement incentive sum under one of the<br/>following options:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four equal annual payments to commence after completion of active service with<br/>the district.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuance of the District-paid health plan for the retiree, as for continuing<br/>employees. The District will cease the monthly payments when an amount equal to<br/>the retirement incentive sum has been paid out by the District in monthly premiums<br/>or upon the death of the retiree, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other payment options equal to the retirement incentive sum that may be proposed<br/>by the retiree will be considered by the District. However, the District retains the<br/>sole authority to accept or reject such options.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person retires under program 1 with less than 15 years (full time equivalent),<br/>then their award under this program will be prorated in relationship to how many full¬<br/>time equivalent years the retiree has in relation to the full 15 full-time equivalent</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>For example: A teacher works five (5) years at full time and 12 years at half time.<br/>We use 180 days to represent a full year’s service:</p>
<p>5 years (full time)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;900</p>
<p>12 years (half time)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1080</p>
<p>1980</p>
<p>15 years (FTE) @ 180 = 2700&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1980&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2700&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= .73</p>
<p>The teacher in the above example would receive 73% of the difference in their salary<br/>and step 4.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest shall not be calculated or paid on the retirement incentive sum for any of the<br/>options of payment.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>APPENDIX D (continued)</p>
<p>Eligibility - Program I: Early Incentive Program</p>
<p>To be eligible for the Retirement Incentive Program, an employee must meet all of the<br/>following criteria:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve in a position represented by the Grass Valley Teachers’ Association contract as<br/>specified under Article 2, Recognition.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has not reached age 60 by June 30 of their final year of employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have completed at least 15 years service in the Grass Valley School<br/>District in a certificated position prior to retirement. Authorized leaves neither interrupt<br/>years of service nor add to years of service.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have either reached the age of 55 or the sum of the employee’s age<br/>plus their years of full-time equivalent certificated service must be equal to at least 75.</p>
<p>Program II: Substitute Incentive Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible teachers may substitute teach after retirement in the Grass Valley School<br/>District for a maximum of 25 days/year at the rate of $215/day.</p>
<p>Any additional days substituted beyond the 25 days/year would be reimbursed at the<br/>regular substitute rate.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible teachers wishing to utilize Program II must be listed on the Nevada County<br/>substitute list.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees participating in this option will enter into a signed substitute agreement<br/>with the District prior to the first day of the school year in each year of eligible<br/>participation. The agreement may include but not be limited to: grade levels, subjects,<br/>and available dates.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will attempt to contact eligible substitutes up to 25 times, or the mutually<br/>agreed upon number of days during the year. An eligible teacher’s refusal to accept an<br/>offered substitute assignment may mean that the particular teacher may not receive<br/>the number of days as stipulated in the mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Eligibility Program II: Substitute Incentive Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serve in a position represented by the Grass Valley Teachers’ Association contract as<br/>specified under Article 2, Recognition.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee has reached age 60 by June 30 of their final year of employment.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must have completed at least 15 full-time equivalent years of District<br/>service in a certificated position prior to retirement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program expires in the school year that the retired employee turns 65 up to a<br/>maximum of five years of participation in the program.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>APPENDIX D (continued)</p>
<p>Program III: Reduced Workload Program</p>
<p>During the three final years of teaching service prior to retirement, the District will make the<br/>STRS Reduced Workload Program available for up to three years to teachers who meet the<br/>STRS eligibility requirements and who will retire at the conclusion of the one to three years<br/>he/she works under the Reduced Workload Program.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiring teacher agrees to work half time during their last years and in exchange the<br/>District will pay the full District share of the annual STRS benefits and pay the full<br/>medical benefit package (to the extent that it pays all full-time employees).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eligible teacher retiring under the reduced workload program shall be allowed the<br/>half-time assignment option of working half-days for the entire year. The district will<br/>make every attempt, but cannot guarantee to assign the teacher to the school, grade level<br/>and time preference of his/her choice.</p>
<p>Other assignment options may be proposed by the retiring teacher but must be agreed to<br/>by the district. Employees are encouraged to consider the Reduced Workload<br/>Information Advisory when designing assignment options.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions to the State Teacher’s Retirement System shall be based on the full-time<br/>salary amount. The employee shall make a contribution to STRS as though he/she was<br/>working full time and receiving full salary. The employer shall make a contribution to<br/>STRS on behalf of the employee as though he/she was serving full time.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall be afforded full District benefits for health and welfare programs as<br/>though rendering full-time service.</p>
<p>Eligibility Program III: Reduced Workload Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retiring teacher must meet all STRS eligibility requirements and retire at the<br/>conclusion of the one to two years he/she works under the Reduced Workload Program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee agrees to inform the District in writing on or before March 1<sup>st</sup> of the year<br/>prior to the beginning of this Reduced Workload Program. The employee must state the<br/>number of years (one to three) that he/she desires to use this program prior to<br/>retirement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall have completed at least 10 full-time equivalent years in the Grass<br/>Valley School District in a position requiring certification. The five (5) years<br/>immediately preceding the Reduced Workload Program must be full-time employment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any leave of absence without pay during the Reduced Workload Program (i.e., personal<br/>business leave or approved leave without pay) that would reduce earnings below 50%<br/>will void participation in this program. The employee may make up days subject to<br/>District approval, in the same school year for which he/she is not paid. If this cannot be<br/>done, the employee will be deemed not to have participated in the Reduced Workload<br/>Program and will not receive a full year of STRS credit.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reduced Workload Program agreement can be revoked only in writing and with the<br/>mutual consent of the employer and employee.</p>
<p>Program IV: Employee Designed Program</p>
<p>Other options may be proposed by the retiree and will be considered by the District.</p>
<p>However, the District retains the sole authority to accept or reject such options. The</p>
<p>Board may also propose additional options.</p>
