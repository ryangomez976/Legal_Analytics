<p>ARTICLE XXXV: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YEAR-ROUND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCHOOL</p>

<p>35.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to notify the Association one hundred twenty (120) days in<br/>advance before increasing the number of year-round schools. The language in<br/>agreement will apply to all subsequent schools which are converted or made<br/>into year-round programs. The District will include the Association on any<br/>study committees formed to convert or start year-round schools in the<br/>District.</p>
<p>35.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members' participation in year-round school shall be, whenever<br/>possible, voluntary.</p>
<p>35.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority for K-6 teachers on a Year-Round schedule shall be defined<br/>in the following order:</p>
<p>1st - at grade level<br/>2nd - on color track<br/>3rd - at school site</p>
<p>35.4 Assignment of unit members to the year-round school site shall be on the<br/>following basis:</p>
<p>35.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members working on a site designated for year-round school shall<br/>be given first priority to remain at that site. In a school going<br/>YR, teachers at that site have first choice for track selection based<br/>on seniority in the district. This selection is only for the grade<br/>level in which they are currently serving.</p>
<p>35.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members from other sites in the District volunteering for<br/>vacancies at the year-round school site shall be given consideration<br/>before recruiting from outside the District.</p>

<p>35.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the absent teacher requests a specific qualified person<br/>(teacher or sub), substitutes will be called in order from a list<br/>constructed by the District, giving priority and the right of first<br/>refusal to laid-off teachers and then to off-track teachers<br/>expressing desire to be included on the list. Within the list,<br/>qualified teachers shall be granted substitute assignments with<br/>consideration given to their seniority.</p>
<p>35.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective with time cards starting after January 15, 2004, the salary<br/>for such assignment for P.U.S.D. teachers shall be a sixty (60)<br/>percent of the per diem rate of the teacher substituting, plus<br/>District standard substitution pay, the total of which shall be<br/>divided by two (2).</p>
<p>35.6 Flexible Scheduling</p>

<p>35.6.1 EXCHANGE DAYS - Bargaining unit members may apply for a paid leave<br/>where there is an exchange of days with another bargaining unit<br/>member subject to the following conditions:</p>

<p>Leave arrangements must be approved by the principals of<br/>the schools involved.</p>
<p>35.6.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum length of such leave is five (5) consecutive<br/>days, unless both teachers have credentials which<br/>authorize service in the assignment of the teacher with<br/>whom they are exchanging. If they both possess the<br/>authorizing credentials, the exchange can be for ten (10)<br/>consecutive days.</p>
<p>35.6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher is limited to ten (10) exchange days per year<br/>unless approved by the district superintendent and such<br/>approval will not establish a precedent for subsequent<br/>requests.</p>

<p>Storage and security of off-track teachers' materials and supplies will be<br/>provided by the District.</p>
<p>35.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room Assignments</p>
<p>35.8.1 Efforts will be made to keep movement of teachers from room-to-room<br/>to a minimum.</p>
<p>35.8.2 Should a roving or rotating site (room) become necessary, it shall<br/>occur only under the conditions that follow, unless there is good and<br/>sufficient reason to vary. Such conditions and reasons are subject<br/>to the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>35.8.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Districts shall first seek volunteers.</p>
<p>35.8.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A payment equal to $1000 shall be paid to unit members in<br/>such an assignment.</p>
<p>35.8.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final decision on such assignment shall be made on the<br/>basis of least seniority of teachers available.</p>
<p>35.8.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full-time 7-12 teacher who must change rooms three (3)<br/>or more times for an entire year will receive a payment of<br/>$1000 annually. Extra periods (6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> periods taught)<br/>shall not count toward this number. The $1000 can be pro¬<br/>rated for a quarter or semester.</p>
<p>35.8.3 Should there be an agreement to have four (4) teachers share three<br/>(3) rooms with all rotating during the school year, the payment of<br/>$1000 shall be equally divided among these four (4) teachers in that<br/>rotation unit.</p>
<p>35.9 Calendar</p>
<p>35.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All regular classroom teachers will be assigned a specific track as<br/>per the agreed-upon calendar. All support staff will be able to<br/>choose a track yearly for purposes of reassignment. Implementation<br/>will begin for the 2000-01 school year.</p>
<p>35.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra-duty days may be added annually if mutually agreed upon by the<br/>District and unit member.</p>
<p>35.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the option to designate the work year for any<br/>position filled after January 1, 1990. In the event the work year is<br/>different from a specific year-round school track or the traditional<br/>school calendar, the District will consult with PEA before<br/>advertising the position.</p>
<p>35.10 Reassignment</p>
<p>35.10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding Article 13.4, a reassignment shall be defined as a<br/>change in a unit member's track and/or grade level to another track<br/>and/or grade level at one's school site for grades K-6.</p>
<p>35.10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campus administration shall post and/or distribute notification<br/>to all site teachers of all known certificated vacancies on site as<br/>they come to the attention of the campus administration.<br/>Notification by telephone or mail shall be made to all off-track<br/>teachers at that site who have requested it.
