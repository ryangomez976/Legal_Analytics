<p>20.14.1 Definitions</p>
<p>“Catastrophic illness or injury” means an illness<br/>or injury:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is expected to incapacitate the<br/>receiving employee for an extended<br/>period of time beyond the employee’s<br/>paid leave entitlement, or</p>

<p>minimum of seven and one-half<br/>(7/4) hours of sick leave to another<br/>employee who has been deemed<br/>eligible to receive this leave.<br/>Donated sick leave or vacation<br/>shall be converted for utilization on<br/>a hour for hour basis meaning the<br/>recipient shall be paid at his/her<br/>regular rate of pay.</p>
<p>The Tulare County Office of<br/>Education will credit the receiving<br/>employee’s sick leave account with<br/>one day of sick leave from each<br/>donating employee in the order in<br/>which the donation is received by<br/>the Tulare County Office of<br/>Education, and will repeat the<br/>process until the receiving<br/>employee has received the<br/>maximum amount of sick leave<br/>credit that he/she needs or may<br/>accrue under 20.14.3. If, through<br/>the initial process of deducting one<br/>day of sick leave credit from each<br/>donating employee, the receiving<br/>employee does not receive<br/>sufficient sick leave credit, the<br/>Tulare County Office of Education</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>in this section and the individual’s condition is<br/>verified by a physician’s written statement.</p>

<p>20.14.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee returning from catastrophic leave<br/>will be reinstated to their former position.</p>
<p>20.14.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on catastrophic leave for his/her<br/>own serious health condition is required to<br/>provide a fitness-for-duty certificate from his/her<br/>physician before he/she will be reinstated to<br/>employment.</p>

<p>day in August and ending the last work day of July<br/>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following the end of the fiscal year. The July payment</p>

<p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/12th of an employee’s normal gross monthly payment</p>
<p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for August through June. The employee will receive this</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deferment the last work day of July. If participation in the</p>
<p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summer pay process begins after the August payroll, a</p>

However, the<br/>employee shall be covered for a period of 30 days from<br/>the date the unpaid leave begins.</p>
<p>Employees on unpaid leaves of absence approved by<br/>the County Superintendent of Schools shall have the<br/>option to continue the insurance coverage for the<br/>duration of the leave with minimum payments to be paid<br/>by the employee to the Tulare County Office of<br/>Education on designated dates defined by the Tulare<br/>County Office of Education.</p>
<p>Employees may participate in the tax sheltered annuity of<br/>their choice, with the Tulare County Office of Education<br/>providing payroll deduction for this purpose.</p>
<p>Should an employee's employment terminate following<br/>the last day of the school year and before the<br/>commencement of the ensuing school year, such<br/>employee shall be entitled to continued paid coverage</p>
<p>certificated employee in the public school system in<br/>California and the benefits shall continue to be paid by<br/>the Tulare County Office of Education until the retiree<br/>reaches the age of seventy (70) or until the death of the<br/>retiree, whichever comes first.

Retirees<br/>and surviving spouses or domestic partners may<br/>continue in the plan, at their own expense. To be eligible<br/>for retirement benefits, an employee must be<br/>participating in the health insurance plan at the time of<br/>retirement. Retirees who are eligible for health insurance<br/>coverage shall be covered under the plan available to the<br/>current employees. Retirees are required by our health<br/>plan to enroll in Medicare, Parts A and B when they<br/>reach the age of eligibility, as Medicare becomes the<br/>primary insurance for the retiree.
