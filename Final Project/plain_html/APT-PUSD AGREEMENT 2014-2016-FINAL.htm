<p>6.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only issues, which were processed and handled in<br/>accordance with the grievance procedure of this Article<br/>6, are subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>6.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for<br/>arbitration, the Superintendent shall request the<br/>California State Conciliation Service to supply a panel<br/>of seven (7) names of persons experienced in hearing<br/>grievances in the public sector. Within five (5) days<br/>after receipt of the list of names, the Association and<br/>the Superintendent, or the Superintendent's designee,<br/>shall alternately strike a name until only one name<br/>remains. The remaining panel member shall be the<br/>arbitrator. The order of striking shall be determined<br/>by lot. In the event the Association does not appear<br/>for the striking process within the allotted five (5)<br/>days, the grievance is deemed to be resolved.</p>
<p>6.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within seven (7) days of the selection of the<br/>arbitrator, the Superintendent or the Superintendent's<br/>designee and the grievant shall attempt to agree upon<br/>the issue or issues to be submitted to the arbitrator<br/>and this Agreement shall be reduced to writing. If they<br/>are unable to agree upon a submission agreement, the<br/>arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to<br/>the written grievance and the answers thereto at each<br/>level.</p>
<p>6.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event there is a dispute between the District and<br/>the grievant as to the arbitrability of any issue or<br/>issues, the question of arbitrability shall be<br/>determined prior to a resolution of the substantive<br/>issue or issues. That determination shall be made by an<br/>arbitrator who will resolve the issue of arbitrability<br/>and who shall not be the same arbitrator who hears and<br/>resolves the substantive issues of the grievance, unless<br/>the parties to the grievance mutually agree, after the<br/>determination of the arbitrability, that the same<br/>arbitrator shall hear and resolve the substantive<br/>issues. The selection of a second arbitrator to hear<br/>the substantive issue or issues shall be postponed until<br/>after the determination of arbitrability and shall be<br/>made in accordance with the above procedures, unless the<br/>parties mutually agree to have the arbitrator who made<br/>the determination regarding arbitrability also hear the<br/>substantive issues.</p>
<p>6.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the issue, or issues, is determined to be<br/>arbitrable, the grievance shall be referred to the<br/>Superintendent or the Superintendent's designee for<br/>reconsideration of the decision in accordance with the<br/>provision of Level III, prior to the selection of a<br/>second arbitrator.</p>

<p>6.5.7</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing<br/>shall be borne equally by the District and the<br/>Association. All other expenses, except release time<br/>provided for the grievant and his or her representative,<br/>shall be borne by the parties incurring them.</p>
<p>6.5.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall afford the District and the<br/>grievant a reasonable opportunity to present evidence,<br/>witnesses and arguments. The arbitrator shall render a<br/>written decision on the issue, or issues, submitted to<br/>the arbitrator as soon as possible after the close of<br/>the hearing, or if an oral hearing has been waived,<br/>after the final submission of written evidence and final<br/>statements.</p>
<p>6.5.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association agree that the<br/>jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator so selected<br/>and the opinions he or she expresses will be confined<br/>exclusively to the interpretation of the express<br/>provision or provisions of this Agreement at issue<br/>between the parties. The arbitrator shall have no<br/>authority to add to, subtract from, alter, amend, or<br/>modify any provisions of this Agreement, or impose any<br/>limitations or obligations not specifically provided for<br/>under the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall<br/>be without power or authority to make any decision that<br/>requires the District or the administration to do an act<br/>prohibited by law, or in violation of this Agreement, or<br/>that involves the exercise of discretion by the District<br/>under the provisions of this Agreement or applicable<br/>law. The arbitrator shall have no power to render an<br/>award on any grievance occurring before or after the<br/>term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6.5.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator, within the limits<br/>prescribed, shall be final and binding upon the parties<br/>to the dispute.</p>
<p>6.5.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the parties mutually agree to share the expenses,<br/>the cost of the services and expenses of the court<br/>reporter shall be paid by the party requesting same.<br/>If, however, one of the parties declines to share the<br/>expenses of the court reporter and subsequently requests<br/>a transcript of the arbitration proceedings or a copy<br/>thereof, that party shall be required to reimburse the<br/>other party one-half (1/2) of the cost of the court<br/>reporter's services and expenses. The cost of any<br/>transcript, or any copy thereof, requested by either<br/>party shall be borne by the party requesting same.</p>
<p>6.5.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable number of relevant employee witnesses shall<br/>be provided release time without loss of pay for the<br/>purpose of testifying at the arbitration hearing,<br/>provided all such employee witnesses shall be allowed to<br/>be placed on an on-call status and required to attend<br/>the arbitration hearing for only so long as his or her<br/>testimony is taken. The cost of any substitute employee<br/>to fill the position during the member's absence for</p>
<p>this purpose shall be paid by the party requesting the<br/>presence of the witness.</p>
<p>6.5.13 By filing a grievance and processing it beyond Level<br/>III, the grievant expressly waives any right to<br/>statutory remedies or to the exercise of any legal<br/>process other than as provided by this<br/>grievance/arbitration procedure. The processing of a<br/>grievance beyond Level III shall constitute an express<br/>election on the part &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievant that the</p>
<p>grievance/arbitration procedure is the chosen forum for<br/>resolving the issues contained in the grievance, and<br/>that the grievant will not resort to any other forum or<br/>procedure for resolution or review of the issues. The<br/>parties do not intend by the provisions of this<br/>paragraph to preclude the enforcement of any arbitration<br/>award in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>6.6 Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>6.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained in this Agreement shall interfere with<br/>a strict literal interpretation of the time limitations<br/>set forth in this Article.</p>

<p>6.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two (2) or more members of the bargaining unit have<br/>the same grievance against an individual, then the<br/>grievance shall be consolidated for purposes of hearing<br/>and decision, provided each member files a separate<br/>grievance and provided, further, that the rights of the<br/>parties are not thereby prejudiced.</p>
<p>6.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues arising out of the exercise by the Board and<br/>administration of its authority and responsibilities<br/>under Article 5 of this Agreement, District Rights,<br/>including the facts underlying its exercise of such<br/>discretion, shall not be subject to the procedures set<br/>forth in this Article 6.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>Article 7: PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>7.1 The District will deduct from the pay of Association members and<br/>pay to the Association the normal and regular monthly<br/>Association membership dues as voluntarily authorized in writing<br/>by the member of the bargaining unit on the District form,<br/>subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such deduction shall be made only upon submission of the<br/>District form, duly completed and executed by the member<br/>of the bargaining unit and the Association, to the<br/>designated representative of the District.</p>
<p>7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not be obligated to put into effect<br/>any new, changed or discontinued deduction until the pay<br/>period commencing fifteen (15) days or more after such<br/>submission.</p>
<p>7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All regular unit members will be paid on a schedule,<br/>which has the first working day of the month as payday.<br/>Unit members working on an extended year contract will<br/>be paid on a twelve (12) month cycle, with voluntary<br/>deductions made on a ten (10) month basis.</p>
<p>7.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes the need to minimize payroll<br/>deduction error and will designate a service person to<br/>provide high priority attention to correcting payroll<br/>errors. The District will expect to make adjustments in<br/>warrants within a seventy-two (72) hour period from time<br/>of notification of the error.</p>
<p>7.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the third month payroll, the District<br/>will provide up to a one thousand dollar ($1,000.00)<br/>advancement to a unit member with payroll deduction<br/>errors, subject to the advancement being repaid,<br/>immediately upon receipt by the unit member of the<br/>revised warrant. Such advancements will be made only<br/>where the source of the error is under the District's<br/>control.</p>
<p>7.2 The District will send to the Association, monthly, a copy of<br/>the Deduction Register, which reflects the Association dues paid<br/>by members by payroll deduction, so long as the Deduction<br/>Register is provided to the District by the County<br/>Superintendent of Schools' Office.</p>
<p>Article 8: HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS</p>
<p>8.1 The District will provide each full-time member of the<br/>bargaining unit with a basic health and welfare benefit<br/>allocation to apply to medical insurance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the</p>
<p>employee's chosen medical coverage, the allocation amounts are<br/>as follows:</p>
<p>Employee only<br/>Employee/Spouse<br/>Employee/Children<br/>Family</p>
<p>$7,200 annually<br/>$10,425 annually<br/>$9,050 annually<br/>$12,410 annually</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>In the event that a full-time member fails to select one of the<br/>Board-approved plans for medical insurance, the District will<br/>attempt to place the member in the plan which most closely<br/>resembles the previous plan. Members who choose not to enroll in<br/>other available coverage under District-approved benefit plans<br/>shall have credited towards their retiree health savings plan or<br/>successor plan any remaining amount after payment of the premium<br/>for employee-only medical participation. Upon deposit in the<br/>retiree health savings plan or successor plan, such amount may<br/>be used for any legal purpose consistent with the laws and<br/>regulations governing retiree health plans or successor plans.<br/>Bargaining unit members shall be solely responsible for any tax<br/>consequences of such accounts.</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in Section 8.4, the health and welfare<br/>benefit allocation referred to in Section 8.1 of this Article<br/>shall be provided by the District on a pro rata basis for<br/>members of the bargaining unit whose assignment is less than<br/>full-time. The pro rata amount shall be determined by<br/>multiplying the member's full-time equivalent employee ratio by<br/>the amount of health and welfare benefit allocation provided for<br/>in Section 1 of this Article. The balance of the premium must<br/>be paid by the member by payroll deduction or salary reduction.<br/>Less than full-time members who choose not to enroll in a group<br/>medical insurance plan approved by the District shall receive no<br/>benefits under the provisions of this section and Section 1 of<br/>this Article.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit who work less than ten (10) hours<br/>per week shall receive no health and welfare benefit allocation<br/>under the provisions of Section 1 of this Article.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person on an authorized unpaid leave of absence which begins<br/>and ends in the same payroll period shall not suffer any loss of<br/>health and welfare benefits allocation by reason of that leave.</p>
<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Flexible Benefit Plan is established providing members with<br/>the opportunity, through payroll reduction, to pay for legally<br/>permissible benefits with pre-tax dollars, as provided by<br/>applicable State and Federal laws. After consultation with the<br/>Association, the District designated a plan administrator to<br/>administer the plan. Charges for reimbursement accounts under<br/>the plan shall be paid by the participant for whom the charge is<br/>assessed. All administrative and processing fees shall be<br/>eliminated as part of the plan in the contract between the<br/>District and the plan administrator. If the elimination of these<br/>fees is not administratively possible, then the fees shall be<br/>paid by the individual participants. The Association shall<br/>notify members of the bargaining unit of the Flexible Benefit<br/>Plan and of their rights and their responsibilities under the<br/>plan. Each member of the bargaining unit shall cooperate in the<br/>implementation of the plan.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide qualified early retirees a medical<br/>insurance allowance if the retiree qualifies for inclusion in a<br/>District approved medical plan. The allowance shall be provided<br/>for a maximum of ten (10) years, or until the member reaches age</p>
<p>sixty-five (65), whichever occurs first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This benefit is</p>
<p>applicable to all employees who retire on or after February 1,<br/>1988, and before the school year in which the employee turns<br/>sixty-five (65) years of age. To qualify for this benefit, an<br/>early retiree must have completed at least fifteen (15) years of<br/>credited full-time service with the Pomona Unified School<br/>District preceding his or her retirement, and must retain the<br/>same medical plan, if possible. The benefit will be fifty<br/>percent (50%) of the amount of the basic health and welfare<br/>benefit allocation for a full-time employee as established in<br/>Section 1 of this Article.</p>
<p>8.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members assigned to Pre-K who work at least<br/>seventy-five percent (75%) of a full-time assignment shall be<br/>entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the District's current<br/>health and welfare allocation for bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>8.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective October 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2004, unit members who have filed with the</p>
<p>District proof of satisfaction of the California statutory<br/>filing requirements to establish a lawful domestic partnership<br/>shall have access to health and welfare coverage for their<br/>domestic partner in the same manner as for any other eligible<br/>dependent. After January 1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2006, such coverage shall continue</p>
<p>only so long as it is required by law in the State of<br/>California.</p>

Appendix III sets forth the work year and salary<br/>schedules for those positions designated as teacher specialist<br/>and teaching teacher specialist.

Existing District<br/>policy for filling of vacancies shall be applied for the<br/>staffing of any new school.</p>
<p>11.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members wishing to transfer to another<br/>site may request to be transferred at the initiation of<br/>the District after attempting, unsuccessfully for two<br/>(2) consecutive school years to transfer, provided,<br/>however, that in each unsuccessful attempt to transfer<br/>they were the candidate with the most seniority and were<br/>not selected for the position.</p>
<p>11.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member already has a transfer application on<br/>file, it will be maintained for a period of 36 months.<br/>It will not be necessary to make a further application<br/>in order to be considered for any vacancies during that<br/>period of time.</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated school site needs as listed in the<br/>posting</p>

<p>selected, then, upon written request, that unit member<br/>will receive a written explanation for the non-selection<br/>based on the above criteria.</p>
<p>11.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positions which become vacant after October 15 will be</p>
<p>posted and selections will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>selectee holds a current teaching position that, when<br/>vacated, will create another position to be posted, then<br/>the selectee cannot transfer to the new position. The<br/>selectee can only transfer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>beginning of the next school year, or whenever the<br/>vacancies caused by the original selection are filled by<br/>an applicant from outside &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the District, or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an</p>
<p>applicant who does not create a new vacancy.</p>
<p>11.3.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a current District employee who is qualified<br/>according to the stated criteria, the District shall not<br/>select a candidate who is not currently employed by the<br/>District.</p>

<p>13.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of pupils toward the standards of expected<br/>student achievement at each grade level in each area or<br/>program of study. The evaluation of member competence<br/>in this area, however, shall not include the use of<br/>publishers' norms established by standardized tests.</p>

<p>13.9 In the event the prime evaluator does not approve the written<br/>statements setting forth objectives, the prime evaluator shall<br/>discuss the written statements of objectives with the member. If<br/>the prime evaluator and the member of the bargaining unit cannot<br/>come to an agreement as to what should constitute said<br/>objectives, the member or the prime evaluator may present a<br/>request for review to the Superintendent. The Superintendent<br/>shall designate a person holding a certificated management<br/>position of Director or above to resolve the dispute. Within<br/>five (5) days of the Superintendent's receipt of the written<br/>request, the member shall specify, in writing, the objectives as<br/>proposed by the member and the objectives as proposed by the</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>prime evaluator, as well as rationale stated by each of them for<br/>their respective positions, including a statement by the member<br/>of why the member believes the written statements of objectives<br/>as proposed by the prime evaluator are inappropriate. A copy of<br/>the member's statement shall be provided to the prime evaluator<br/>who shall indicate his or her agreement or disagreement with the<br/>statements contained in the member's request.

<p>resolve the dispute may call a conference if he or she<br/>determines such a conference would facilitate the<br/>resolution of the dispute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the</p>
<p>individual designated by the Superintendent shall be<br/>final and binding on the prime evaluator and the member.<br/>The member's objectives shall reflect the decision of<br/>the Superintendent's designee and the member shall be<br/>obligated to meet said objectives.</p>
<p>13.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this Article 13, the prime evaluator shall be<br/>the member's immediate supervisor and/or any other certificated<br/>management employee who is so designated by District management.<br/>In the event someone other than the immediate supervisor is<br/>designated, the designation shall be made on or before October<br/>15. The person so designated shall be a certificated management<br/>employee and with respect to a member of the bargaining unit who<br/>is a classroom teacher, shall, whenever possible, be a person<br/>who serves at the same location as the member.</p>

<p>information concerning the member's performance. The evaluator<br/>shall not consult members of the bargaining unit for the purpose<br/>of completing a unit member's evaluation.</p>
<p>13.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one (1) observation made for evaluation purposes shall<br/>be made at a time mutually agreeable to the member and the prime<br/>evaluator; the time of that observation, however, may be<br/>rescheduled at the prime evaluator's request. If a time for</p>
<p>this observation cannot be agreed upon, the prime evaluator<br/>shall conduct the observation on a specified date with at least<br/>five (5) days' notice to the member, which date may be<br/>rescheduled by the prime evaluator.

The member shall be<br/>given at least two (2) days' notice of the conference. The<br/>member shall have the right to have a representative present at<br/>the conference. The conference shall be held in private,<br/>provided, however, the District reserves the right to have<br/>present such administrators as it deems necessary. A group<br/>conference may be held in the event more than one (1) member is<br/>reprimanded for the same infraction.</p>

It shall be the responsibility<br/>of the credential holder to:</p>
<p>17.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop and plan his or her individual professional<br/>growth program subject to prior approval of the<br/>credential holder's immediate supervisor or designee, or<br/>a District- appointed professional growth advisor. The<br/>same procedure shall be followed with respect to amended<br/>plan(s) developed by the credential holder. All plans<br/>shall be approved or disapproved within ten (10) working<br/>days of submission. No professional growth advisor or<br/>other person shall compel a credential holder to include<br/>any particular activities in his or her professional<br/>growth plan.</p>
<p>17.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit to the professional growth advisor and to the<br/>Office of Personnel Services, no later than June 1 of<br/>each year during the five (5) year plan, a report<br/>setting forth the acceptable activities engaged in<br/>during the previous twelve (12) month period, including<br/>the number of hours of each activity.

Notice of full or partial compliance with the<br/>requirements of the five (5) year program shall be<br/>submitted by the credential holder in writing to the<br/>professional growth advisor no later than ninety (90)<br/>calendar days prior to the expiration of the five (5)<br/>year period.</p>
<p>17.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional growth advisor shall sign professional growth<br/>plans independently of any evaluation of the credential holder's<br/>performance that may affect the credential holder's employment.</p>
<p>17.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a credential holder does not complete the professional growth<br/>requirements during the five (5) year renewal period, the<br/>credential will expire. She or he is eligible for a one (1) time,<br/>two (2) year reinstatement of the Professional Clear Teaching<br/>Credential. The credential holder is responsible for requesting<br/>the reinstatement in a written statement to the Commission on<br/>Teacher Credentialing.</p>
<p>17.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Professional Growth Panel shall be established consisting of<br/>two (2) teachers and two (2) administrators. The Associated<br/>Pomona Teachers shall select the teacher members of the panel.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall select the administrators on<br/>the panel. All members of the panel shall serve two (2) year<br/>terms with half of the members beginning with a one (1) year term<br/>in order to stagger the terms of membership.</p>
<p>17.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The credential holder has a right to appeal to the Professional<br/>Growth Panel if he or she believes that the professional growth<br/>advisor has taken an adverse action that he or she considers to<br/>be unfair, arbitrary, or contrary to law, of the provisions of<br/>this Article. If the decision of the panel is unacceptable to<br/>the credential holder, she or he may appeal the decision of the<br/>panel to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.</p>
<p>17.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alleged violations of this Article 17 shall not be subject to<br/>the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>Article 18: PROGESSIVE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>18.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the purpose of progressive discipline is<br/>to offer the bargaining unit member an opportunity to receive<br/>support and improve behavior which might otherwise constitute<br/>grounds for more substantial discipline. When a bargaining unit<br/>member is given a written official reprimand for an infraction<br/>of rules or delinquency in professional performance, a<br/>conference shall be held for the issuance of the reprimand. The<br/>member shall be given at least two (2) days' notice of the<br/>conference. The member shall have the right to have a<br/>representative present at the conference. The conference shall<br/>be held in private, provided however, the District reserves the<br/>right to have present such administrators as it deems necessary.<br/>A group conference may be held in the event more than one (1)<br/>member is reprimanded for the same infraction.</p>
<p>18.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written (not email) request of a member, formal discipline<br/>documents in a bargaining unit member's personnel file shall be<br/>sealed if more than four years old and if, during the two year<br/>period following the date of the document, the bargaining unit<br/>member was not formally reprimanded or suspended, and no warning<br/>letter for similar misconduct has been issued. This shall not<br/>prevent use of the document(s) in the event of a hearing of any<br/>kind if admissible as an exception to the four year rule in<br/>Education Code section 44944, or if legally required, e.g., if<br/>responsive to and not exempt from a public records request or if<br/>required by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.</p>
<p>18.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progressive Discipline</p>
<p>18.3.1 No bargaining unit member will be disciplined, reduced in rank<br/>or compensation, nor otherwise subjected to adverse action as a<br/>result of alleged misconduct, without &quot;just cause&quot;. The concept<br/>of &quot;progressive discipline&quot;, and the prohibition of disparate<br/>treatment by an administrator, are to be generally applicable,<br/>but with the understanding that circumstances may justify an<br/>exception, and/or make progressive discipline unnecessary, and<br/>that reasonable diversity in disciplinary decisions may be<br/>justifiable or necessary based on individualized factors and<br/>circumstances as determined in the judgment of the responsible</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>administrator. The provisions regarding progressive discipline<br/>shall be applicable to disciplinary documentation issued<br/>subsequent to the adoption of 18.1 through 18.3. Non-reelection<br/>of probationary personnel shall be excepted from this article.</p>
<p>Discipline of a member shall be based on grounds set forth in<br/>Education Code section 44932.</p>
<p>18.3.2 Steps of Progressive Discipline:</p>
<p>Progressive discipline shall consist of the following steps;<br/>informal discussion (which may be documented in writing),<br/>written warning, written reprimand, suspension without pay and<br/>termination. Grievance procedures for discipline actions shall<br/>only be available in the event of suspension pursuant to 18.5;<br/>however, progressive discipline may be raised as a defense in<br/>any formal action to suspend and/or dismiss.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Discussion</p>
<p>Discussion between appropriate administrative personnel<br/>and bargaining unit member</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Warning</p>
<p>Written warnings issued to the bargaining unit member<br/>constitute the first level of formal discipline and are<br/>communications between the appropriate administrative<br/>personnel and the member. Written warnings will not be<br/>placed in the member's personnel file unless there is a<br/>subsequent written reprimand, in which case any previous<br/>written warning(s) may be appended to the reprimand and<br/>placed in the member's personnel file.</p>
<p>18.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member shall be provided with any document of a derogatory<br/>nature prior to its placement in the member's personnel file<br/>and shall be given the opportunity to submit a written response<br/>which shall be attached to the derogatory material prior to its<br/>placement in the personnel file.</p>
<p>18.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures for Suspension</p>
<p>18.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to suspend a member of the bargaining<br/>unit for up to ten (10) days without pay for serious<br/>misconduct.</p>
<p>18.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the bargaining unit shall be given written notice of</p>
<p>the suspension by the Superintendent or Superintendent's<br/>designee. The notice shall specify the length of the suspension<br/>and the reason for the suspension. The notice shall also contain<br/>a statement of the member's right to a conference with the<br/>Superintendent or Superintendent's designee concerning the<br/>suspension and the member's right to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orally</p>
<p>or in writing within ten (10) days of the notice. The member's<br/>request for a conference shall be in writing and shall be<br/>received by the Superintendent or Superintendent's designee<br/>within the time specified in the notice of suspension. In the<br/>event a conference is held to discuss the suspension, the member<br/>may be represented by an individual of his or her choice.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>18.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member who is to be suspended shall be notified of his or her<br/>right to appeal the decision of the Superintendent by-<br/>utilization of Article 6, Grievance Procedure, and to be<br/>represented in the grievance by the Association. Any such<br/>grievance shall be initiated at Level III of the grievance<br/>procedure within seven (7) days after receipt of the decision to<br/>suspend. In the event the suspension is grieved, suspension<br/>shall be imposed only after a final determination of the<br/>grievance upholding the suspension.</p>
<p>18.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall interfere with the right of the District to<br/>remove the member from the work location to which he or she<br/>is assigned, to reassign the member, and/or temporarily relieve<br/>the member of the duties and to place the member on paid leave<br/>pending the determination of the suspension.</p>
<p>18.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suspension provisions of this article apply only to the<br/>procedures to be followed in the event a member of the<br/>bargaining unit is suspended for ten (10) days or less under the<br/>provisions of this article and do not apply to, limit, or<br/>preclude other disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>18.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District attempts to suspend an employee under the<br/>Education Code, and fails, the District is prohibited from<br/>attempting to suspend under this article for the same offense.</p>
<p>Article 19: PROCEDURES FOR PERSONNEL REDUCTION</p>
<p>In the event permanent and probationary members of the bargaining<br/>unit are laid off under the provisions of Education Code Sections<br/>44955 and/or 44955.5 in accordance with Section 44949, the dates<br/>prescribed in each of said sections are hereby extended for a<br/>period of one (1) month.</p>
<p>Article 20: ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY</p>

<p>20.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members must notify the Association and District<br/>of their preference in membership status. Bargaining unit members<br/>have thirty (30) days from the date of becoming a bargaining unit<br/>member to decide whether to be a service fee payer or hold<br/>membership in APT. If the unit member holds a bona fide religious<br/>objection to this, the unit member must follow Article 20,<br/>Section 20.9 of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>20.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the bargaining unit employed in a bargaining unit<br/>position for a full school year shall pay the full dues or<br/>service fees required pursuant to Section 1 hereof. In the event<br/>an individual becomes a member of the bargaining unit after the<br/>beginning of the school year, his or her obligation to pay dues<br/>or service fees to the Association shall commence on the first of<br/>the month following the member's entry into the bargaining unit.</p>
<p>20.5 A member may pay such fees or dues directly or may authorize<br/>payroll deduction in accordance with Article 7 of this Agreement.<br/>The payment of dues or service fees authorized through payroll<br/>deduction shall be submitted to the Association within a<br/>reasonable time. If the member elects to pay the fees or dues<br/>directly, said payment shall be made annually in advance.</p>
<p>20.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service fee payers are not required to support the Association's<br/>activities that are not related to collective bargaining. The<br/>Association will furnish all service fee payers with an adequate<br/>explanation of the basis for the service fee and the calculation<br/>of that portion of the fee, which is chargeable to activities<br/>related to collective bargaining. The Association will provide<br/>all service fee payers with a reasonably prompt opportunity to<br/>challenge this calculation before an impartial decision-maker,<br/>and will deposit into an escrow account all amounts reasonably in<br/>dispute while such challenges are pending. The Association will<br/>not retain the portion of an employee's service fee that is<br/>chargeable to purposes not related to collective bargaining, if<br/>that member files a timely objection as required by the<br/>Association's policy.</p>
<p>20.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a member of the bargaining unit does not pay<br/>the dues or fees referred to in Section 1 of this Article<br/>directly to the Association or authorize payment through payroll<br/>deduction, the District will, on written notification and<br/>presentation of adequate documentation by the Association, deduct<br/>the service fee and appropriate amounts to cover fees in arrears.<br/>This deduction will continue in accordance with Education Code<br/>Section 45061. Such notification shall include evidence that the<br/>employee has failed to pay such dues or fees for at least three<br/>(3) consecutive months, and that the Association has notified the<br/>employee, in writing, on at least two (2) separate occasions, at<br/>least two (2) weeks apart, of the alleged default in dues or<br/>nonpayment of fees. The Association's notification to the member<br/>must include a statement of the amount of fees or dues owed as of<br/>the date of said notification.</p>
<p>20.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall indemnify and hold harmless the District,<br/>its officers, agents and employees, from and against any and all<br/>claims, demands, suits, administrative proceedings, or any other<br/>action arising out of, or in any way connected with, the<br/>provisions of this Article 20, Organizational Security, and/or<br/>the implementation thereof, including, without limitation, the<br/>District's deduction and/or payment of monies hereunder.</p>
<p>20.8.1 In any case in which the provisions of this section are<br/>invoked or contested and it is necessary for the<br/>District to defend a position, use legal counsel, or<br/>incur any expenses in so doing, the Association agrees</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>to provide the defense and to pay all costs incurred by<br/>the District, including attorneys' fees. In addition,<br/>the District may notify the Association that a claim has<br/>been made or a suit instituted against it and request<br/>the Association to provide legal representation.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of such notification, the Association will<br/>provide legal representation for the District at its own<br/>expense. The Association shall have the exclusive right<br/>to decide and determine whether any such action shall be<br/>compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed.</p>
<p>20.8.2 The Association will pay any judgments ordered against<br/>the District arising out of the proposed or actual<br/>implementation of this Article.</p>

Such member<br/>shall be required, in lieu of a service fee, to pay sums equal to<br/>such service fee to one of the following nonreligious, non-labor<br/>organizations, or charitable funds exempt from taxation under<br/>Section 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code:</p>
<p>20.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cesar Chavez Memorial Education Awards Program;</p>

The<br/>District shall provide the Association with copies of<br/>such proof. If any employee who claims this religious<br/>exemption requests the Association use the grievance<br/>procedure on that employee's behalf, the Association<br/>shall charge the employee for the reasonable cost of<br/>using such procedure.</p>

<p>21.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Adult and Career Education member shall be at his or her<br/>work location and responsible for instructional and other<br/>assigned duties for the number of hours for which the member is<br/>paid. Thirty (30) hours per week is considered a full-time<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>21.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult and Career Education members shall receive the following<br/>health and welfare benefits:</p>
<p>21.5.1 The District shall provide for each full-time (24 or<br/>more hours per week) Adult and Career Education member a<br/>health and welfare benefit allocation to apply to<br/>medical insurance. Based on the employee's chosen<br/>medical coverage, the allocation amounts are as follows:</p>
<p>Employee only<br/>Employee/Spouse<br/>Employee/Children<br/>Family</p>
<p>$7,200 annually<br/>$10,425 annually<br/>$9,050 annually<br/>$12,410 annually</p>
<p>Entitlement to this health and welfare benefit<br/>allocation shall be determined by the member's regularly<br/>assigned hours. For the purpose of this health and<br/>welfare section only, and not for any other purpose, 24<br/>hours per week is considered a full-time adult school<br/>teaching assignment. For all other purposes, a full-time<br/>adult school teaching assignment shall be 30 hours per<br/>week.</p>
<p>In the event that a full-time Adult and Career Education<br/>unit member fails to select one of the Board approved<br/>plans, for medical insurance, the District will attempt<br/>to place the member in the plan that most closely<br/>resembles the previous plan.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Full-time Adult and Career Education members who choose<br/>not to enroll in other available coverage under District<br/>approved benefit plans shall have credited toward their<br/>individual retiree health savings plan or other<br/>successor plan any remaining amount after payment of the<br/>premium for employee only medical participation. Upon<br/>deposit in the retiree savings plan or successor plan,<br/>such amount may be used for any legal purpose consistent<br/>with the laws and regulations governing retiree health<br/>savings plans or successor plans. Bargaining unit<br/>members shall be solely responsible for any tax<br/>consequences of such accounts.</p>
<p>21.5.2 The health and welfare benefit allocation referred to in<br/>subsection 5.1 hereof, shall be provided by the District<br/>on a pro rata basis for Adult School members whose<br/>regular assignment is less than full-time. The pro rata<br/>amount shall be determined by multiplying the member's<br/>full-time equivalent employee ratio by the amount of<br/>health and welfare benefit allocation provided for in<br/>subsection 5.1 of this Article. The balance of the<br/>premium must be paid by the member by payroll deduction<br/>or salary reduction. Less than full-time members who<br/>choose not to enroll in a group medical insurance plan<br/>approved by the District shall receive no benefits under<br/>the provisions of this subsection and subsection 5.1 of<br/>this Article.</p>
<p>21.5.3 Commencing September 1,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1988,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Career&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education</p>
<p>members assigned fifteen (15) hours per week or more who<br/>are not also employed in the District's K-12 or pre¬<br/>kindergarten programs are eligible for a District-<br/>provided health and welfare allocation on the following<br/>pro rata basis:</p>
<p>Benefit</p>
<p>Hours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate</p>
<p>24 or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more per week&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100%</p>

<p>15 to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50%</p>
<p>21.5.3.1 The health and welfare benefit allocation<br/>provided by this subsection 5.3 shall be paid<br/>on a ten (10) month basis from September<br/>through June of each year to members employed<br/>in the Adult School during that time. This<br/>amount shall be updated annually to reflect<br/>the yearly health and welfare benefit<br/>allocated on a ten (10) month basis. Adult<br/>and Career Education unit members assigned<br/>between 15 and 2 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours per week&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are</p>
<p>eligible to receive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pro&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rata</p>
<p>basis and who were &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enrolled&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District</p>
<p>approved health plan the previous school year<br/>who fail to select a Board approved plan for<br/>medical insurance shall be enrolled, on a pro<br/>rata basis, in the same manner as a full-time<br/>member under Section 5.1 if and only if the<br/>pro rata amount fully covers the employee<br/>only premium cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of the</p>
<p>District supplemental IRC-125 deposit shall<br/>be pro rata based &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work</p>
<p>hours for a full-time assignment.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>21.5.4 A Flexible Benefit Plan is established providing<br/>eligible members with the opportunity through payroll<br/>reduction to pay for legally permissible benefits. After<br/>consultation with the Association, the District<br/>designated a plan administrator to administer the plan.<br/>Charges for reimbursement accounts under the plan shall<br/>be paid by the participant for whom the charge is<br/>assessed. All administrative processing fees shall be<br/>eliminated as part of the plan in the contract between<br/>the District and the plan administrator. If the<br/>elimination of these fees is not administratively<br/>possible, then the fees shall be paid by the individual<br/>participants. The Association shall notify Adult School<br/>members of the Flexible Benefit Plan and of the members'<br/>rights and responsibilities under the plan. Each Adult<br/>School member shall cooperate in the implementation of<br/>the plan.</p>
<p>21.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class size in the Adult and Career Education program shall be no<br/>less than twenty (20) students and in the event the enrollment<br/>drops below twenty (20), the District retains the right to drop<br/>the class and terminate the services of the teacher. At the<br/>discretion of the District, however, Special Education classes of<br/>less than twenty (20) students may be retained at Lanterman<br/>Developmental Center.</p>
<p>21.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No negative evaluation of performance shall be predicated upon<br/>any written material of a derogatory or critical nature, which<br/>has been received or written by the member's evaluator, unless<br/>the member has first been given notice of same or an opportunity<br/>to discuss the matter with the evaluator. The member shall have<br/>the right to have the member's written reply become a part of the<br/>member's personnel file. In the event the member's evaluator<br/>indicates any deficiencies on a written observation report or<br/>written evaluation, the evaluator shall hold a conference with<br/>the member to make specific recommendations as to the areas of<br/>needed improvement in the member's performance and shall endeavor<br/>to assist the member in improving performance.</p>
<p>21.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult and Career Education members shall be entitled to the<br/>following leaves:</p>
<p>The District and Association agree that domestic partnerships<br/>will be recognized in accordance with state law effective January<br/>1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for purposes of leave entitlements under the terms of</p>

<p>times the number of hours worked per week.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>21.8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay for any such period of absence shall be<br/>the same as the pay which would have been<br/>received had the member served during such<br/>period. Credit for leave of absence need not<br/>be prior to taking such leave by the member<br/>and such leave of absence may be taken at any<br/>time during the school year. If an Adult and<br/>Career Education member does not render<br/>service for an entire year, but has used all<br/>paid sick leave, the amount of compensation<br/>received for sick leave taken, but unearned,<br/>shall be repaid to the District and the<br/>District shall have the right to make any<br/>necessary adjustment in the last warrant. If<br/>a member does not take the full amount of<br/>leave allowed in any school year under this<br/>section, the amount not taken shall be<br/>accumulated from year-to-year.</p>
<p>21.8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Article 21, subsection<br/>8.2, of this Agreement, extended illness and<br/>injury benefits related to compensation shall<br/>not apply to the first ten (10) days of<br/>absence on account of illness or accident of<br/>any Adult and Career Education member<br/>employed five (5) days a week, or to the<br/>portion of ten (10) days of absence to which<br/>a member employed less than five (5) days a<br/>week is entitled hereunder on account of<br/>illness or accident.</p>

<p>management, a member shall not return to work<br/>until he or she submits a medical doctor's<br/>authorization to return to work after a leave<br/>provided for in subsections 8.1, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3,</p>
<p>and 8.4 of this Article.</p>

<p>conditions of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement. In the event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the District and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>

<p>30.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party to this Agreement intends to interpret and apply the<br/>provisions of this Agreement in a reasonable manner.</p>

<p>30.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the responsibility to provide fully credentialed<br/>counselors at the middle school level.</p>
<p>30.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association believe that since our<br/>bargaining unit members serve as role models, they should<br/>maintain professional standards of dress and grooming. Bargaining<br/>unit members, during school hours, will wear clothing that<br/>demonstrates a high regard for education and presents an image<br/>consistent with job safety and responsibilities.</p>
<p>30.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary teachers shall schedule parent conferences commencing<br/>with the fourth day of conference week, and shall provide their<br/>conference schedule to the principal at least two (2) school days<br/>before the beginning of conference week. Elementary teachers may<br/>utilize the first two (2) days of the conference week to prepare<br/>the progress reports. Teachers may print out their own progress<br/>reports.</p>
<p>Whenever it becomes evident to a teacher that a pupil is in<br/>danger of failing a course or subject, or if receiving an<br/>unsatisfactory or needs improvement, the teacher shall conference<br/>with, or provide a written report to, the parent(s) of the pupil.</p>
<p>30.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department Chairpersons (high school) and Unit Leaders<br/>(elementary and secondary) shall collaborate with the school<br/>administration to provide leadership in the organizational area<br/>assigned. These leadership positions will contribute to the<br/>effective operation of the organizational area assigned by<br/>seeking input from department/grade level members in order to<br/>promote a climate for staff conducive to the highest possible<br/>achievement of educational goals.</p>
<p>30.8.1 For the selection of Department Chairpersons (high<br/>school) and Unit Leaders (elementary and secondary),<br/>the District will establish a selection process that<br/>includes the following:</p>
<p>30.8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishment of criteria by the District for<br/>both of the special assignments identified<br/>above upon which selections will be based</p>
<p>30.8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the established criteria, bargaining<br/>unit members in a department or grade level<br/>at the school shall recommend a candidate or<br/>candidates</p>
<p>30.8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will make the final selections,<br/>including consideration of the criteria and<br/>input provided during the process. The<br/>principal may exercise his/her discretion and<br/>appoint another member willing to assume the<br/>position.</p>

<p>30.8.4</p>
<p>A bargaining unit member who is recommended<br/>by his/her department or grade level at the<br/>school but not selected by the principal may<br/>request a meeting with the principal.
