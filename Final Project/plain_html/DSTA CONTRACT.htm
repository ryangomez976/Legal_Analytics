<p>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The DESERT SANDS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (District) and the DESERT SANDS<br/>TEACHERS ASSOCIATION/CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION/NATIONAL EDUCATION<br/>ASSOCIATION (Association), having met and negotiated in good faith, hereby agree as follows:</p>
<p>ARTICLE 1<br/>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>The Desert Sands Unified School District recognizes the Desert Sands Teachers<br/>Association/Califomia Teachers Association/National Education Association as the exclusive representative for<br/>purposes of the Rodda Act (Government Code section 3540, et seq. Title 1, Division 4, Chapter 10.7) for the<br/>employees in the appropriate bargaining unit comprised of the following positions:</p>
<p>Teachers (including Teachers on Special Assignment, Project Teachers and other teachers paid<br/>on the DSTA salary schedule that do not have a regular classroom assignment), grades K-12 and Early<br/>Childhood Education; School Nurses; Librarians; Counselors and Speech Pathologists and excluding all other<br/>positions not designated, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p>Superintendent; Assistant Superintendents; Directors; Program Specialists; District<br/>Psychologists; Coordinators; School Principals; Assistant Principals; Deans; and Substitute Teachers.</p>
<p>The District has grown to where the utilization and assignments for many of its teachers spans a<br/>number of responsibilities other than direct classroom teacher (e.g., BTSA mentor, PAR Consulting Teacher,<br/>Project Teacher, T.R.A.C. Coach Reading Coach, etc.). It is anticipated that teachers assigned such<br/>responsibilities will fulfill them professionally. The assigned and required responsibilities will not include<br/>duties and responsibilities which would make the teacher a “supervisory employee” within the meaning of<br/>Government Code section 3540.1, subdivision (m).<sup>1</sup> If the Association wishes to protest any such assignment, it<br/>shall first meet with the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services; if not satisfied, the Association may then<br/>take the matter before the Public Employment Relations Board. Such matters are specifically excluded from the<br/>contractual grievance/arbitration procedures of this Agreement.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 2<br/>DISTRICT RIGHTS</p>
<p>It is understood and agreed that the District retains all of its powers and authority to direct,<br/>manage, and control the affairs of the District to the full extent of the law. Included in, but not limited to, those<br/>duties and powers are the exclusive right to: determine its organization; direct the work of its employees;<br/>determine the times and hours of operation; determine the kinds and levels of services to be provided, and the<br/>methods and means of providing them; establish its educational policies, goals, and objectives; insure the rights<br/>and educational opportunities of students; determine staffing patterns; determine the number and kinds of<br/>personnel required; maintain the efficiency of District operations; determine the curriculum; build, move, or<br/>modify facilities; establish budget procedures and determine budgetary allocation; determine the methods of<br/>raising revenue; contract out work; and take action on any matter in the event of an emergency. In addition, the</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> [For purposes of information only, Government Code Section 3540.1, subdivision (m) reads as follows: “ ‘Supervisory employee’ means any employee, regardless of job<br/>description, having authority in the interest of the employer to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or the<br/>responsibility to assign work to and direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively recommend that action, if, in connection with the foregoing functions, the exercise of<br/>that authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.”].</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 3</p>
<p>Board of Education retains the right to hire, classify, assign, evaluate, promote, terminate, and discipline<br/>employees.</p>
<p>The exercise of the powers, rights, authority, duties, and responsibilities by the District shall be<br/>limited only by the specific terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3<br/>ASSOCIATION RIGHTS</p>
<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Released&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time:</p>
<p>Effective as soon as the District can arrange for appropriate coverage, and in each subsequent<br/>year thereafter during which this arrangement is in effect, the Association President shall be released on up to a<br/>full-time basis during the time he or she is otherwise regularly scheduled to work. The Association shall<br/>reimburse the District therefore in an amount equal to 50% of the total annual cost of a full-time classroom<br/>teacher placed at Step 4, Column D of the teachers’ annual salary schedule. The phrase “annual cost” includes<br/>salary, health and welfare benefits, STRS contributions and all other payments made to or on behalf of the<br/>employee as a direct function of the employee’s salary (examples include, but are not limited to. Worker’s<br/>Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Medicare, etc.). The Association shall reimburse the District for the<br/>applicable amounts described herein in ten (10) equal monthly installments payable on the last working days of<br/>the months September through June inclusive. In the event of a retroactive salary adjustment during the school<br/>year, the Association shall be required to pay the increased amount. The Association may also have an<br/>additional twenty (20) days released time for representatives designated by the president for Association<br/>business. The Association will reimburse the District up to 50% of those days (partial or whole) not reimbursed<br/>through mandated costs.</p>
<p>The president will have the right to return to his/her school site and assignment after serving a<br/>two-year term provided the assignment still exists. If the term is extended, the return right will be only to the<br/>same school site if a vacancy within the credential area at the site exists. In the event of no vacancy at that site,<br/>the president will submit a list of not less than four (4) preferences for district wide vacant positions within the<br/>credential area and the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services will place the person at a site on the<br/>preference list.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to reasonable rules and regulations, the Association shall have the right to</p>
<p>use school buildings and facilities for Association activities only outside established work time, except when all<br/>the following conditions have been met:</p>
<p>3.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An authorized representative of the Association has advance permission from the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee regarding the specific time, place, and type of activity to be conducted on<br/>District property; or, in the case of meetings held in school buildings for on-site bargaining unit members, the<br/>principal or his/her designee may grant such permission.</p>
<p>3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or his/her designee has verified that the proposed Association<br/>activities and use of facilities will not interfere with or interrupt school or District programs and/or the<br/>performance of the employment duties of unit members or District employees, and</p>
<p>3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will not directly or indirectly interfere with the right of employees to<br/>refrain from listening to or speaking with an Association representative.</p>
<p>3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to pay a reasonable fee for any unusual wear or damage to<br/>District facilities caused by Association activities.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 4</p>
<p>3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the right to post notices with an appropriate Association</p>
<p>identification and regarding activities and matters of Association concern on designated bulletin boards, at least<br/>one of which shall be provided in each school in areas frequented by teachers. The Association may use the<br/>District mail services and teacher mailboxes for communications to teachers. Bargaining unit members may not<br/>use the District e-mail system for mass mailings. The Association may use the District e-mail for the limited<br/>purpose of announcing and notifying members of Association meetings, submitting the agendas for such<br/>meetings, and for announcing Association elections, the dates and voting procedures. District mail and e-mail<br/>shall not be utilized for the purposes prohibited by Education Code section 7054. Copies of Association<br/>material posted or distributed for general Association information shall be mailed to the Superintendent at the<br/>time the information is posted and/or distributed.</p>
<p>3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not post or distribute information which Association</p>
<p>representatives know to be or have reason to believe is false or defamatory. District management may<br/>immediately remove such materials from posting or circulation. District management will notify the DSTA site<br/>representative when this action is taken.</p>
<p>3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and agendas will be made available to DSTA.</p>
<p>The District agrees that every reasonable effort will be made to deliver a packet to the President<br/>of the Association no later than the Friday preceding the Board of Education meeting.</p>
<p>The remaining packet and agendas shall be provided in advance of the Board meeting and<br/>delivered through the school mail at the same time and in the same manner as provided to other recipients<br/>except for the Board itself, the Superintendent, and the Assistant Superintendents.</p>
<p>3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizational&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security:</p>
<p>3.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member of the bargaining unit who is a member of the Association, or who has<br/>applied for Association membership, may sign and deliver to the District an assignment form authorizing<br/>deduction of unified membership dues and initiation fees. Such authorization for payroll deductions for<br/>payment of membership dues shall continue in effect until revoked in writing by the employee.</p>
<p>3.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is not a member of the Association or who does not make an<br/>application for membership within thirty (30) days following the effective date of this paragraph or, for those<br/>hired after the effective date of this paragraph, within thirty (30) days from the date of commencement of duties,<br/>shall pay to the Association a fee in the amount of the United Education Profession (UEP) dues, provided,<br/>however, that the unit member may authorize payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as provided in<br/>Section 3.7.1.</p>
<p>3.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who does not utilize the provisions of Section 3.7.1 may arrange<br/>to pay service fees directly to the Association in a lump sum in lieu of having such fees deducted from his/her<br/>salary warrant; in the event such unit member is delinquent in payment of fees, the Association shall so notify<br/>the District in writing and request that the District initiate involuntary deductions pursuant to Section 3.7.4.</p>
<p>3.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For unit members who have not executed voluntary written authorization and/or for<br/>unit members who are delinquent in the payment of service fees as described in Section 3.7.3, the District shall<br/>deduct from the salary warrant the amount of the service fees to be paid to the Association.</p>
<p>3.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dues and service fees withheld by the District shall be transmitted to the<br/>Association at the address specified in writing by the Association for receipt of such funds. The District shall<br/>not be obligated to put into effect any new, changed, or discontinued deduction until the pay period commencing<br/>fifteen (15) workdays or more after such submission.</p>
<p>3.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deductions for members of the bargaining unit who commence duties after the</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 5</p>
<p>beginning of the school year and who therefore are not subject to deductions until after the beginning of the<br/>school year, shall be prorated to the number of school months during the school year in which he/she is a<br/>member of the Association or otherwise subject to the terms of this Organizational Security Clause. Any<br/>fraction of a month shall be counted as a full month.</p>
<p>3.7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No unit member shall be required to join the Association or to make an agency fee<br/>payment if the unit member is an actual verified member of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which has<br/>historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations; this<br/>exemption shall not be granted unless and until such unit member has verified the specific circumstances. Such<br/>employee must, instead, arrange with the Association to satisfy his/her obligation by donating the equivalent<br/>amount to a non-labor, non-religion charitable fund, tax exempt under section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal<br/>Revenue Code, chosen from the following list:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DSTA Scholarship Fund</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FACT (Foundation to Assist California Teachers)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;United Way</p>
<p>The Association shall have the right to request reasonable verification of such payments in the<br/>form of either canceled checks and/or receipts.</p>
<p>3.7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall not deduct money specifically earmarked for NEA/PAC unless<br/>such deduction is affirmatively, separately, and specifically authorized in writing by the unit member.</p>
<p>3.7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and/or its parent organization, CTA, agrees to indemnify and hold<br/>harmless from liability and pay all legal fees and legal costs incurred in defending against any court action<br/>and/or administrative action before the Public Employment Relations Board challenging the legality or<br/>constitutionality of the agency fee provisions of this Agreement or their implementation; and, shall have the<br/>exclusive right to decide representation and to determine whether any such action or proceeding referred to in<br/>the above paragraph shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, tried, or appealed.</p>
<p>3.7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the express intention of the parties that the agency fee obligation outlined<br/>herein constitutes a condition of continued employment and that the parties contemplate utilizing the remedies<br/>provided for in Education Code section 45061 for enforcing this Article.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4<br/>CURRICULUM COUNCIL</p>
<p>Any proposed changes in the District's definition of educational objectives, determination of<br/>course and curriculum content, and selection of textbooks shall first be discussed by the Curriculum Council. In<br/>the event a Curriculum Council recommendation is amended by District management prior to being presented to<br/>the Board, a member of the Curriculum Council selected by the Association shall be notified at least one week<br/>in advance, and be entitled, upon request, to present to the Board the original recommendation and speak in<br/>support thereof.</p>
<p>The District shall, upon request, consult with the Association on the definition of educational<br/>objectives, the determination of the content of courses in the curriculum, and the selection of textbooks to the<br/>extent such matters are within the District's discretion under the law.</p>
<p>Faculty Representatives of Curriculum Council shall be elected to this position within the first<br/>two (2) weeks of a new school year by their faculty. Absent such election, the Principal may appoint the<br/>representative or representatives. The District reserves the right to split the Curriculum Council into an<br/>elementary and secondary grouping.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSVSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 6</p>
<p>ARTICLE 5<br/>NONDISCRIMINATION</p>
<p>Neither the District nor the Association shall discriminate against any employee on the basis of<br/>race, color, handicap, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age (as provided by State and Federal<br/>law), marital status, nor on the basis of membership or lack of membership in an employee organization, nor<br/>participation in lawful employee activities, or refraining from participation in employee organization activities.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 6</p>
<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS</p>
<p>6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment:</p>
<p>6.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the conditions and procedures below, individual school sites may change</p>
<p>their schedules in ways which contradict and/or modify existing contract language. This language applies to<br/>individual school sites. Schedule changes under this language shall not be considered as binding past practice or<br/>precedential for other school sites.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed schedule change will be reviewed by a joint committee containing<br/>four (4) representatives from the Association and four (4) representatives from the<br/>District. The joint committee will be responsible only for determining whether or<br/>not the proposed schedule modifies contract language and to ensure that<br/>instructional minutes mandates are met.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans must be submitted by February 15 to the joint committee and the joint<br/>committee will complete the review process by March 1<sup>st</sup>. Such plans must be<br/>signed by the site administrator and at least 20% of the permanent bargaining unit<br/>employees at the site. In addition to the required 20%, probationary bargaining unit<br/>members may also sign the plan.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the joint committee determines that the proposed schedule does not modify<br/>contract language and that instructional minutes both fall within required mandates<br/>and are not increased on an annualized basis, then the schedule may be<br/>implemented without a vote.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the joint committee determines that the proposed schedule modifies contract<br/>language, the plan shall be voted upon by the site staff and must pass by securing<br/>approval of at least 67% of those eligible to vote, in accordance with the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site administrator shall prepare the ballot and present it to the DSTA<br/>Faculty Representative for review prior to the scheduled vote. Attached as<br/>Appendix F are recommended sample ballots which may be used as<br/>templates for voting. A detailed listing of each proposed new schedule<br/>shall be on display in the voting area.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a ballot includes more than one proposed new schedule, the ballot<br/>shall state that eligible voters may vote for only one option; ballots with<br/>more than one choice marked shall be invalid.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 7</p>
<p>c. If a ballot contains more than one proposed new schedule and none<br/>receives 67% or more votes of those eligible to vote, the schedule with the<br/>highest number of votes shall be placed on a ballot for a second vote. If<br/>that proposed schedule receives the support of 67% or more of those<br/>eligible to vote, said schedule will be in effect for the ensuing school year;<br/>if the schedule fails to gain 67% support, then the schedule will remain<br/>unchanged.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site votes must be completed by April 15 and the schedule published to site<br/>employees no later than May 1.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan is approved by the required percentage, the plan will take effect for one<br/>year. The site shall vote again by April 1<sup>st</sup> of the implementation year. If approved<br/>by the required percentage, the plan will become permanent and not require<br/>additional yearly votes. Attached as part of Appendix F is a sample Voting Results<br/>Report which may be used by the site administrator and/or DSTA Faculty<br/>Representative. Notice of the vote results and a copy of the plan (schedule change)<br/>shall be filed with both the Association and the District.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other terms and conditions under Article 6.1 apply.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site vote process will be as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote will be conducted by secret ballot. An equal number of<br/>representatives from DSTA and the District, not from the affected site, will<br/>conduct the election and count the ballots. The ballots shall be counted in the<br/>presence of a site administrator and one or more DSTA site representatives.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of days to conduct the election will be two (2) days.<br/>Only those employees defined in Article 1 of the DSTA-DSUSD Collective<br/>Bargaining Agreement and currently assigned to the site at least 50% of the<br/>work week shall be allowed to vote. Employees who, as of the election date,<br/>have submitted a written notice of resignation or retirement, or have accepted<br/>a transfer to another site, shall not be eligible to vote.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the voting period, affected employees are entitled to participate in the<br/>process without any undue pressure from any source to vote for or against the<br/>plan. Should a bargaining unit member feel that he/she has been exposed to<br/>undue pressure, he/she should contact either the DSTA President or the<br/>Assistant Superintendent, Personnel.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and Association encourage all affected staff to vote including<br/>unit members who are on an approved leave of absence. It is expected that at<br/>least 90% of the eligible affected staff at a site shall participate in the vote. If<br/>fewer than 90% vote, the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel and the DSTA<br/>President shall be contacted and a meeting shall be held to determine the<br/>reasons for the lack of participation.</p>
<p>Transfer to/from the affected site:</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without regard for agreed upon timelines for requesting transfers, any unit<br/>member who does not wish to teach or work under a newly approved</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 8</p>
<p>schedule may request a transfer to another position within the district for<br/>which he/she is qualified.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members, from other sites, who wish to participate in a newly approved<br/>plan at a given site, shall also have the right to request a transfer.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who request a transfer pursuant to this Article, and do not<br/>receive such transfer for the beginning of the following school year, shall<br/>have their request remain active for one year. At any time during the year,<br/>the member may submit to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel, written<br/>notice to have the request withdrawn.</p>
<p>9. All affected unit members will be notified on or before July 1, of changes in school<br/>site starting times, if any, for the ensuing school year: if, of necessity, the changes<br/>are implemented after July 1, affected unit members will be notified as soon as<br/>practicable.</p>
<p>6.1.2 The regularly scheduled full time unit member workday shall be seven hours<br/>inclusive of a duty-free lunch period and preparation period. In the event such day is extended for a faculty<br/>meeting, site faculty and administration may agree to compensating time off within the same or following week<br/>in lieu of compensation available under Article 6.1.9.1. The starting and ending times will be determined by the<br/>respective site administrators and faculty with due regard for the students' schedules. Pursuant to current<br/>practice, regularly scheduled preparation time for classroom teachers is as follows:</p>
<p>Grade Level &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time</p>
<p>ECE (Early Childhood Education) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including Fridays)</p>
<p>K, 1, 2 &amp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week</p>
<p>4-5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;week</p>
<p>Secondary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of one period per day</p>
<p>Any non-academic course shall be in the above preparation period allocations (e.g., physical education).</p>
<p>The above times may be less under circumstances which include, but are not limited to, days or<br/>weeks when assemblies are scheduled, or in a week when a holiday or other non-work day occurs, minimum<br/>days (exclusive of parent conference days), testing periods, emergencies or other reasonably unforeseeable<br/>circumstances or pursuant to a one-seventh assignment or per language in 6.1.1 above.</p>
<p>6.1.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of designated non-instructional teacher work<br/>days will be provided to unit members to prepare their classroom prior to the start of the first date of instruction<br/>of the school year.</p>
<p>6.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Agreement, the District will not increase instructional time<br/>without first notifying the Association and providing it an opportunity to meet and negotiate.</p>
<p>6.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an emergency or other unforeseen circumstances or for justifiable<br/>reason, a teacher may request that the principal or his/her designee release him/her for a portion of the workday<br/>between the end of his/her last assigned period and the end of the teacher's workday. The principal the shall not<br/>unreasonably deny the request.</p>
<p>6.1.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is absent for less than a full day, one hour will be deducted for<br/>each hour of absence or fraction thereof from unit member’s available sick leave or personal necessity leave,<br/>whichever is applicable. If the unit member does not have sufficient accrued and available sick or personal<br/>necessity leave to cover the absence, then the time off shall be unpaid.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 9</p>
<p>6.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless directed otherwise by the principal, conference and preparation periods and<br/>the time before and after school will be used primarily for conferences, preparation, and/or student assistance.</p>
<p>6.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above hours, the Association and the District recognize that the<br/>professional responsibilities of educators involve additional time and activities as part of the normal<br/>instructional program. Accordingly, teachers shall attend and participate in such activities as open house/back-<br/>to-school night, graduation/promotions, award ceremonies, and perform such other reasonable professional<br/>responsibilities and assignments as directed, not to exceed eight (8) hours per school year.

Subject to the provisions of Section 13.22, if no guest teachers are<br/>available, the principal shall distribute said assignments equitably amongst the faculty. However, it shall be the<br/>responsibility of the principal to make every effort to obtain regular guest teacher first. School counselors shall<br/>not be required to substitute except in emergency situations.</p>
<p>6.1.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time unit members shall be entitled to one duty-free lunch period consisting of<br/>at least forty (40) consecutive minutes, exclusive of passing periods; unit members working less than full-time<br/>but five (5) hours or more shall receive a pro-rata lunch period. It is understood by the parties that, because of<br/>varying schedules and practices among the different schools, the length of the period may vary from school to<br/>school.</p>
<p>6.1.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management representative responsible for calling faculty meetings shall post<br/>an agenda for the meeting at least one day prior to the date of the meeting unless such meeting is called on an<br/>emergency basis. If a majority of the faculty at a particular school wishes to place an additional matter on the<br/>agenda, they may do so by filing a written request with the Association's site representative.</p>
<p>6.1.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a maximum of two (2) hours per month for meetings beyond the<br/>contractual work day such as staff, grade level, collaboration, TRAC, Program Improvement, QEIA or<br/>department meetings (except Department Chairs as they are subject to a special assignment stipend). The<br/>meetings shall not exceed a total of one hour per meeting beyond the contractual day. If mandatory meetings<br/>exceed twenty (20) hours per school year beyond the contractual day, affected unit members shall be paid at the<br/>District’s hourly rate pursuant to Article 13.20.1 (b) for each additional hour worked or be granted compensated<br/>time off for each additional hour worked.</p>

<p>Jury duty procedures are as follows:</p>
<p>6.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members called for jury duty are not required to report for work prior to<br/>reporting for jury duty unless the start of their regular work day is two-and-one-half (2 1/2) hours or more prior<br/>to the time they are required to report for jury duty.</p>
<p>6.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member released from jury duty prior to the end of his/her regular workday<br/>shall report to his place of employment if more than one-and-one-half (1 1/2) hours of the workday remains.</p>

<p>Page 10</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tandem Teaching:</p>
<p>A program of tandem teaching may be provided as follows:</p>
<p>6.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One teaching assignment at a school site shall be shared by two teachers who<br/>volunteer to participate in the project.</p>
<p>6.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each teacher will mutually agree to share equally the assignment including<br/>instructional time, subject matter, co-curricular activities, and other assigned duties as required by the District.</p>
<p>6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.3 Each teacher will be compensated at fifty percent (50%) of his/her placement on the<br/>certificated salary schedule, sick leave, and retirement. The District will contribute up to the equivalent of one<br/>(1) health and welfare benefit package for each tandem team of two (2) teachers. At the time the teachers agree<br/>to participate in a tandem teaching program, the teachers shall elect either (a) for both teachers to receive fifty<br/>percent (50%) of the benefit package (i.e. the District contributes one half of the benefit premiums for each<br/>teacher and the teachers contribute the other half of the benefit premiums through payroll deduction), or (b) for<br/>one teacher to waive his/her health and welfare benefits entirely and for the other teacher to receive the full<br/>(100%) benefit package.</p>
<p>6.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of illness of one of the tandem teachers, the other teacher will<br/>substitute; in such instance the absent teacher shall have the amount of sick leave utilized deducted and the<br/>substituting partner shall be credited with an equivalent amount, in half-day increments.</p>
<p>6.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a long-term absence of one tandem teacher, a long-term guest<br/>teacher will be employed on the shared basis.</p>
<p>6.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tandem teaching shall be a commitment for one complete school year. A teacher<br/>wishing to withdraw from tandem teaching shall process his/her request as provided in Article 8 of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>6.3.7 Teachers who work eighty-five percent (85%) of their tandem teaching assignment<br/>during the school year shall be credited with one year's service for purpose of advancement on the salary<br/>schedule.</p>
<p>6.3.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary teachers new to the District, i.e., who have not already earned<br/>permanent status in DSUSD, shall not be assigned to a tandem teaching position. Probationary teachers<br/>assigned to a tandem teaching position (teachers who previously attained permanent status with the District)<br/>shall not be credited with a year of probationary service, i.e., towards permanent status, for the year or years<br/>served as a tandem teacher.</p>
<p>6.3.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administration shall have the discretion to approve or disapprove<br/>implementation of a tandem teaching assignment at their particular site. The site administrator, upon request of<br/>affected teachers, shall give written educational related reasons for disapproving a particular request. The<br/>decision is not subject to the grievance arbitration clause but may be appealed to the Assistant Superintendent,<br/>Personnel.</p>
<p>The parties have entered a separate Memorandum of Understanding covering a pilot program of<br/>Site-Based Shared Decision-Making. This Memorandum of Understanding is attached for information purposes<br/>only; it is not to be deemed part of the collectively negotiated agreement.</p>
<p>6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home/Hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instruction:</p>
<p>At the beginning of each school year, the District shall establish a list of teachers by site<br/>preapproved for home/hospital instruction.</p>

<p>6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety Conditions</p>
<p>6.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall make reasonable provisions for health and safety of unit members<br/>during working hours; and shall review conditions brought to its attention.</p>
<p>6.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall comply with the District’s reasonable regulations and directives<br/>designed to provide safe and healthy working conditions.</p>
<p>6.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A District safety committee shall be established to meet regularly in accordance<br/>with the committee’s duly adopted bylaws and shall recommend safety policies, accident prevention awareness<br/>methods, and safety credits. The committee shall evaluate the effectiveness of District health and safety<br/>programs.</p>
<p>The committee shall consist of a minimum of nine (9) members with equal representation of<br/>DSTA members, CSEA members, and Administration.</p>
<p>6.5.4 Unit members shall report to their immediate supervisor or the Assistant<br/>Superintendent of Personnel or designee, any intimidation, assault or battery upon District employees or any<br/>threat of force or violence directed toward District employees at any time or place related to school activity or<br/>school attendance.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harassment/Hostile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Environment</p>
<p>6.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district shall make reasonable provisions for unit members’ freedom from<br/>harassment during working hours and shall review conditions brought to its attention.</p>
<p>6.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No grievance may be filed alleging a violation of Article 6.6 until after all<br/>applicable complaint resolution procedures such as the Employee to Employee Complaint Procedure, P.A.R.T.<br/>and other available procedures are exhausted.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 7<br/>CALENDAR</p>
<p>7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for minimum days over and above those already scheduled by the District<br/>may be initiated through the following procedures:</p>
<p>7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint faculty-principal decisions at the individual school buildings with request<br/>submitted to the Assistant Superintendent, Education at least one month in advance.

<p>7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will have the authority to allow or disallow the request for an additional<br/>day. The Board's decision shall be final and is specifically excluded from the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 12</p>
<p>7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and the Association will meet no later then February 15th of each year</p>
<p>to establish a mutually agreed upon calendar for the subsequent year. The agreed upon calendar will be<br/>submitted to the School Board no later than the last Board meeting in April and the approved calendar<br/>distributed on or before May 1 of each year. Nothing herein shall be interpreted and applied to prevent the<br/>District from unilaterally adopting a teacher work calendar in the event such negotiations result in impasse,<br/>providing, however, that such adoption shall not preclude negotiations concerning wages and hours in the event<br/>the District adopts a calendar which contains more teacher work days than in the preceding year. Once the<br/>Board of Education has adopted, the District will not make changes in such calendar without first notifying the<br/>Association and providing it with an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8<br/>TRANSFER</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer:</p>
<p>A transfer is defined as a change by a bargaining unit member from one school to another<br/>within the District. Transfers may be involuntary or voluntary, subject to the provisions below:</p>
<p>8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer:</p>
<p>District management may initiate the involuntary transfer of employees whenever such transfer<br/>is in the best interest of the District or of affected employees. The determination of &quot;best interest&quot; is a matter to<br/>be decided by District management and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure, unless an affected<br/>employee alleges that the transfer was punitive or arbitrary.</p>
<p>An employee affected by such a transfer shall be given notice thereof as soon as<br/>administratively practicable. Upon request by the employee, a conference will be held between the appropriate<br/>management person and the employee to discuss the reasons for the transfer.</p>
<p>Except for staffing new schools, the District will first utilize the voluntary transfer procedures<br/>of Section 8.3 for vacancies which are known by the first working day in May of the school year preceding the<br/>year in which the vacancy occurs. All unit members in permanent status who apply for such vacancies will be<br/>granted an interview.</p>
<p>8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer:</p>
<p>District management shall post in all schools a list of current and/or anticipated vacancies; such<br/>lists shall be updated periodically.</p>
<p>The District may recruit outside the District for the purpose of filling the vacancy.</p>
<p>Requests for voluntary transfer may be filled with the district at any time, however this does not<br/>guarantee an interview if the request is filed outside the transfer window of March 1 through April 7. The<br/>District need not consider any requests for voluntary transfer unless such requests are addressed to specific<br/>vacancies.</p>
<p>District management shall select the most qualified applicant, based upon a review of the<br/>following criteria:</p>
<p>8.3.1 Qualifications for the vacancy, including grade level and/or subject area experience,<br/>appropriate credentials, ability to perform responsibilities of the vacant positions and any special qualifications<br/>for the vacant position.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 13</p>
<p>8.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of evaluations, personnel files, letters of recommendation and interviews.</p>
<p>8.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years of experience with DSUSD.</p>
<p>8.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal requirements of the District. In relying on 8.3.4, the District shall make a<br/>reasonable effort to find a qualified replacement provided the unit member has been in his/her previous position<br/>for at least the two preceding years in permanent status. The concept of “legal requirements of the District” also<br/>incorporates the recently enacted provisions of Education Code Section 35036.</p>
<p>When a request for voluntary transfer is denied for reasons listed in 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 above,<br/>District management shall, upon request, provide unsuccessful applicants with a statement of reasons for denial<br/>of their request for transfer.</p>
<p>The District shall retain requests in an &quot;active&quot; file for no less than one year following date of<br/>receipt of the request.</p>
<p>Unit members whose requests are comparable to the available position shall be notified of the<br/>vacancy. Such unit member or members must immediately notify the Personnel Services Office if they are still<br/>interested in such position.</p>
<p>8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an involuntary transfer occurs, a unit member having received notice of the<br/>transfer shall, upon request to his/her principal, have two paid working days to effectuate the transfer through<br/>preparing and organizing his/her classroom environment and for observation purposes. The unit member may<br/>opt for one day, if the unit member believes only one day is necessary to accomplish the above purposes. When<br/>an involuntary room change occurs a unit member having received notice of such change, shall upon request to<br/>his/her principal, have one paid working day to effectuate the move through preparing and organizing his/her<br/>classroom environment.</p>
<p>For purposes of this clause the phrase “paid working day” means that if the unit member moves<br/>on a regular work day he/she will receive regular pay and, where appropriate, the District will provide a<br/>substitute; if the unit member chooses to utilize his/her own time for the move, then in that event, the District<br/>will pay the unit member at the substitute daily rate.</p>
<p>8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the District’s legal requirements the<br/>following special conditions will be observed:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From March 1 through April 7, teachers in the District will be allowed to submit<br/>transfer requests for any and all sites in the District for which they would be<br/>qualified to teach. These transfer requests will be for openings for the following<br/>school year. This is the only time that transfer requests will be accepted for<br/>openings for the following school year, except as provided in paragraph 6 and 7<br/>below.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site principals will be provided with a list of candidates who request to be<br/>transferred to his/her site by April 10. When seeking to fill a vacancy the site<br/>principal will conduct interviews from the list of interested candidates who are<br/>credentialed and qualified for the vacancy to be filled.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals will first conduct interviews from the list of transfer candidates before<br/>filling the vacancy with a “new hire.” <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals may require additional interviews as necessary, from the list of transfer<br/>candidates.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSJA</p>
<p>Page 14</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positions filled during the year with tempo ran employees will be considered as<br/>available for voluntary transfer consideration.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positions such as Reading Specialist, Project Teacher, or Counselor will be flown<br/>as vacancies arise and will be exempt from the requirements in section 1 above.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a change of principals, openings will be posted and transfer applications<br/>will be accepted at any sites where there is a new principal. Teachers at a site<br/>where a principal leaves after April 7 may submit a transfer for posted vacancies.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for selection will continue to be those criteria listed in Article 8.3.1<br/>through 8.3.4.</p>
<p>8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment:</p>
<p>Site management shall identify potential vacancies during the school year and notify faculty<br/>prior to those vacancies being posted by the District. Unit members at the site may volunteer for a change in<br/>assignment at the site. If the principal chooses from among volunteers or makes an involuntary<sup>7</sup> reassignment,<br/>such reassignments shall be based on the criteria listed in 8.3.1 through the first sentence of 8.3 .4.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 9</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE/ARBITRATION</p>
<p>9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions:</p>
<p>9.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance: A grievance is an allegation by a unit member or die Association that<br/>the District has violated, misinterpreted or misapplied a specific provision or provisions of tiiis agreement, and<br/>that by reason of such violation, misinterpretation or misapplication, the grievanf s rights have been adversely<br/>affected.</p>
<p>Like grievances involving like facts may be consolidated and handled as one grievance<br/>providing the parties mutually agree diat they are indeed like grievances involving like facts; in such event, the<br/>final determination shall apply to all grievants.</p>
<p>Except for Article 3 grievances, whenever the Association files a grievance, it must identify the<br/>specific employee or employees affected; the District need not process grievances which do not meet this<br/>requirement.</p>
<p>9.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working Day: Any day in which the central administration offices of the District<br/>are open for business. Whenever the word &quot;day&quot; is used in this Article it shall refer to a working day.</p>
<p>9.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisor: The site or district level administrator having immediate and direct<br/>supervisory<sup>1</sup> responsibilities over the grievant.</p>
<p>9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;request, the grievant shall be entitled to representation by the</p>
<p>Association at any or all steps of die grievance procedure. Where the grievant is not represented, the District<br/>shall not agree to final resolution of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and<br/>the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to state its views on the matter.</p>
<p>9.2.1 Both parties agree diat these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential<br/>as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 15</p>
<p>9.2.2 The time limits contained herein are considered maximum time limits; however,<br/>time limits may be extended by mutual agreement. In the event the grievant fails to meet a time limit, such<br/>failure shall constitute a waiver of the grievance. In the event the District fails to meet a time limit, such failure<br/>shall allow the grievant to proceed to the next step of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levels:</p>
<p>9.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level: Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant may attempt<br/>to resolve the grievance through an informal conference with the grievant's immediate supervisor. Such<br/>conference, as well as actual formal filing of a written grievance in the event the conference does not resolve the<br/>problem, must take place within the applicable time limits as outlined in Level I below.</p>
<p>9.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I: No later than twenty (20) days following the act or omission giving rise to<br/>the grievance, or, no later than twenty (20) days following the date upon which the employee reasonably should<br/>have known of the act or omission, the grievant must present such grievance in writing in an appropriate form to<br/>the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>The written grievance shall contain a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the specific<br/>provision(s) of the agreement allegedly involved, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The immediate supervisor shall communicate a written decision to the employee within seven</p>
<p>(7) days after receiving the grievance.</p>
<p>Within the above time limits, either party may request a personal conference with the other</p>
<p>party.</p>
<p>If the grievance involves conduct which is obviously outside the immediate supervisor's<br/>jurisdiction (e.g., salary schedule placement), the grievance may be initiated at Level II subject to the same time<br/>limitations which apply under 9.3.2.</p>
<p>9.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II: If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance at Level I, or if no written decision has been rendered within seven (7) days after presentation of the<br/>grievance, he/she may file the grievance in writing with the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel or his/her<br/>designee within ten (10) days after receipt of the Level I response or the date the Level I response was due,<br/>whichever is earlier.</p>
<p>The written grievance shall include a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the<br/>circumstances involved, the specific provisions of the agreement alleged to have been violated, misinterpreted or<br/>misapplied, the decision rendered at Level I, if any, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The Assistant Superintendent, Personnel or his/her designee shall communicate a decision in<br/>writing within ten (10) days after receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the administrator may request a<br/>personal conference within the above time limits.</p>
<p>9.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level II, he/she may<br/>within ten (10) days appeal the decision on the appropriate form to the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>The Superintendent or his/her designee shall communicate his/her decision in writing to the<br/>grievant within fifteen (15) days.</p>
<p>9.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV: If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level III, he/she may,<br/>within ten (10) days, submit the grievance to the Association. The Association shall have the exclusive<br/>authority to decide whether or not to request arbitration of the grievance. If the Association requests arbitration,<br/>it must do so within fifteen (15) days following receipt of the grievant request.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>9.3.6 Level IV: Arbitration:</p>
<p>Upon receipt of a request for arbitration, the Parties shall request the California Conciliation<br/>Service to supply a panel of seven (7) names. The Parties shall select the arbitrator from that panel by<br/>alternately crossing out names. The Association and District shall alternate the first strike. This procedure is<br/>not intended to preclude the Parties' mutually agreeing upon an arbitrator prior to requesting a panel from the<br/>above conciliation services. The parties may mutually agree to use expedited arbitration. The arbitration date<br/>will be scheduled no sooner than sixty calendar days from the filing for level IV. This time period will be<br/>available if either party decides to request mediation.</p>
<p>9.3.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as possible after his/her selection, the arbitrator shall schedule a hearing<br/>wherein relevant testimony and documentary evidence may be introduced. The parties shall supply the<br/>arbitrator with a written submission of the issue or issues to be heard. If there is an issue of arbitrability, it shall<br/>first be presented to and decided by the arbitrator prior to a hearing and/or decision on the substantive merits.</p>
<p>9.3.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon the parties, shall be in<br/>writing and shall set forth his/her findings of fact, his/her reasoning, conclusions, and remedy. The arbitrator's<br/>authority shall be limited to deciding the issues submitted by the parties; the arbitrator shall have no power or<br/>authority to add to, subtract from, alter, delete, amend, or modify the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>9.3.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem<br/>expenses, travel, subsistence expenses, and the cost of any hearing room will be borne equally by the District<br/>and the Association. All other costs will be borne by the party incurring them. If the parties jointly request a<br/>transcript, they shall equally bear the cost thereof; otherwise the party requesting a transcript shall pay for it.</p>
<p>The parties intend that this grievance/arbitration clause be the exclusive procedure for resolving<br/>alleged violations, misinterpretations or misapplications of this Agreement. This does not preclude the parties<br/>from seeking to modify, vacate, or confirm the award pursuant to applicable Code of Civil Procedure sections.<br/>Judicial confirmation of the award is not a condition precedent to voluntarily complying with the award.</p>
<p>9.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous:</p>
<p>The Association will exclusively receive time off from duties for the processing of grievances<br/>herein for unit members who are designated as Association grievance representatives, subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>9.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall designate in writing to the Superintendent the names of unit<br/>members who are to receive the time off; changes shall be given to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel in<br/>writing as they occur.</p>
<p>9.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four (24) hours prior to release from duties for grievance processing, the<br/>designated representative must inform the immediate supervisor in order that substitute service may be obtained,<br/>if such is necessary.</p>
<p>9.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time off shall be limited solely to one (1) designee representing a grievant, and<br/>the grievant, in a conference with a management person. Additional representatives may be added by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>9.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances shall this time off include use of time for matters such as<br/>investigating grievances, gathering information, interviewing witnesses, or preparing a presentation.</p>
<p>9.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties intend that Level IV is automatically suspended upon the expiration<br/>date of the contract or any extension thereof and the Association has waived its right to insist otherwise. The</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 17</p>
<p>only exception is for grievances arising prior to the expiration date of the contract or any extension thereof.<br/>Now the Association no longer wishes to waive this right and therefore will produce case law for the district to<br/>review and to discuss possible resolution.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 10<br/>NO STRIKE/NO LOCKOUT</p>
<p>The purpose of this clause is to provide for peaceful, harmonious, and uninterrupted services<br/>regardless of disputes which arise under this Agreement or outside the scope of this Agreement. Accordingly,</p>
<p>10.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Agreement and any agreed upon extension thereof, it is<br/>agreed and understood by the Association, its officers, agents, or members that there will be no strike, work<br/>stoppage, slowdown, or refusal or failure to fully and faithfully perform job functions and responsibilities, nor<br/>will there be compliance with the request of other labor organizations to engage in such activities.</p>
<p>10.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association recognizes the duty and obligation of its representatives to comply<br/>with the provisions of this Agreement and to make every effort toward inducing all employees to do so. In the<br/>event of a strike, work stoppage, a slowdown, or other interference with the operations of the District by<br/>employees who are represented by the Association, the Association agrees in good faith to take all necessary<br/>steps to cause those employees to cease such action upon written notice to the Association, by delivery to any<br/>Association officer, in hand or otherwise.</p>
<p>10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that, in the event this Article is violated, the Board shall be entitled<br/>to pursue any and all lawful remedies through available legal and/or administrative forums.</p>
<p>10.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the term of this Agreement, or any agreed upon extension thereof, the<br/>District agrees not to lock out bargaining unit members.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11<br/>LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Illness or Injury (Sick) Leave:</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Sections 13.15 and 13.16 of this agreement provide as follows:</p>
<p>Credit for continuous service as defined above will be given for any one (1) year in which the<br/>employee worked seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the days school was in session.</p>
<p>Except as provided in Article 12, Evaluation Procedures, credit for advancement on the salary<br/>schedule shall be granted for any one (1) school year in which the employee rendered authorized paid service to<br/>the District for seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the days school was in session, exclusive of summer<br/>school.

<p>11.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time unit members shall be entitled to ten (10) days' leave with full pay for<br/>each school year for purposes of personal illness or injury. Unit members who work less than full-time shall be<br/>entitled to that portion of the ten days' leave as the number of hours per week or regularly scheduled duty relates<br/>to the number of hours for a full-time unit member in a comparable position.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>

<p>11.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all current and accrued leave is exhausted, additional nonaccumulated leave<br/>shall be available for a period not to exceed five school months pursuant to Education Code section 44977. The<br/>amount deducted for leave purposes from the unit member's salary shall be the amount actually paid a substitute<br/>employee to fill the position during the leave, or, if no substitute is employed, the amount which would have<br/>been paid to a substitute. Sick leave, including accumulated sick leave, and the five-month period shall run<br/>consecutively. The benefit provided by this paragraph is available one time only for a single illness or injury: if<br/>a school year terminates before the five-month period is exhausted, however, the employee may take the balance<br/>of the five-month period in a subsequent school year.</p>
<p>11.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member does not utilize the full amount of leave under paragraph 11.1.1,<br/>the amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>11.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees returning to work from sick leave involving major surgery or illness or<br/>accident shall be required to present a doctor's release verifying medical permission to return to work. District<br/>management may require a physician's or other verification as to an employee's claimed reason for absence.<br/>The employee shall submit a report of absence, including verification if required, to the immediate supervisor<br/>within three days after the absence.</p>
<p>11.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit member must contact his immediate supervisor as soon<br/>as the need to be absent is known to permit the employer time to secure substitute service. Except in cases of<br/>emergency, failure to provide adequate notice shall be grounds for denial of leave with pay.</p>
<p>11.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may not be allowed to return to work and may be placed on leave<br/>without pay if the immediate supervisor is not notified of the employee's intent to return to work at least two (2)<br/>hours prior to the beginning of the work day.</p>
<p>11.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank:</p>
<p>11.1.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be an eligible participant of the Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank (&quot;Bank&quot;), a<br/>probationary or permanent certificated employee must donate one (1) day of sick leave during the open<br/>enrollment period of its first year of operation and one day each year thereafter. If the total number of days in<br/>the Bank exceeds 1000 at the first of September of any year, members who have previously donated will be<br/>exempted from donations that year. New members wishing to enter the Bank will be required to donate one (1)<br/>day during the open enrollment period in the year they join regardless of the total number of days in the Bank.</p>
<p>11.1.7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave day contributions will be authorized on the appropriate form and<br/>continue from year to year under the provisions addressed below until canceled by the certificated employee.<br/>No sick leave may be surrendered or drawn for purposes of summer school.</p>
<p>11.1.7.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the initial enrollment, a certificated employee may only join the Sick<br/>Leave Bank during the annual open enrollment period during the month of September.</p>
<p>11.1.7.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees otherwise eligible for Catastrophic Sick Leave during the<br/>initial open enrollment period may apply for a donation from the Bank without making a prior donation.</p>
<p>11.1.7.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations of sick leave days to the Bank shall be irrevocable. Sick leave which<br/>is donated under this section shall be deducted from the accrued sick leave authorized under Section 11.1.1<br/>above.</p>
<p>11.1.7.1.5 Subject to all terms and conditions herein, a permanent certificated employee may<br/>donate up to five (5) additional days per year, earmarked for a specifically named employee who is eligible to<br/>draw from the bank. If the sick leave day donations for specifically named employees is refused by the<br/>Catastrophic Sick Leave Committee, the donation form will be returned to the donor and the sick leave days will<br/>not be deducted from the donor's sick leave account.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 19</p>
<p>11.1.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A catastrophic injury or illness shall be defined as: any injury or illness which<br/>incapacitates a certificated employee for an extended period of time (in excess of sixty [60] consecutive calendar<br/>days) based upon competent medical evidence.</p>
<p>11.1.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee who qualifies for catastrophic injury or illness leave may<br/>not draw upon the Bank until all fully paid illness or injury leave is exhausted. A certificated employee who has<br/>exhausted sick leave but still has differential leave is eligible for a partial supplement from the Bank. The<br/>District shall pay the certificated employee full pay and the Bank shall be charged one sick leave day. This shall<br/>not exceed the amounts allowed as maximum below.</p>
<p>Leave from this Bank may not be used for illness or disability which qualifies the certificated<br/>employee for Workers' Compensation leave, and his/her own paid leave.</p>
<p>Once the days earmarked for a specifically named employee have been exhausted, the<br/>maximum number of workdays allowed by one member for a single catastrophic injury/illness shall not exceed<br/>forty (40) work days. The certificated employee may request up to an additional forty (40) work days should the<br/>condition continue by filing an additional request for consideration by the Committee. If there are insufficient<br/>days in the Bank, there is no obligation to grant leave hereunder, in whole or in part. Neither the District,<br/>Association and/or Committee shall be legally responsible if there are insufficient days in the Bank to provide a<br/>Catastrophic Sick Leave donation.</p>
<p>11.1.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The certificated employee who receives leave from the Bank shall furnish all<br/>requested medical information deemed necessary by the Joint Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank Committee (to be<br/>referred to as the Committee, as defined in Section 11.1.7.7). The Committee determines the certificated<br/>employee's eligibility to receive donated leave under this section. Upon request by the Committee, the<br/>certificated employee shall submit a &quot;Certificated Sick Leave Bank Request for Withdrawal&quot; form for the<br/>release of medical information. The Committee shall be entitled to obtain an independent medical evaluation to<br/>determine a certificated employee's right to receive leave from the Bank.</p>
<p>11.1.7.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee who wishes to donate sick leave shall submit a<br/>&quot;Certificated Sick Leave Bank Deposit&quot; form with the Payroll Department. This form authorizes the donation to<br/>the Bank and the assignment of the leave to the Bank or a specified individual described in 11.1.7.1.5. No<br/>surrender or assignment shall be effective until approved by the Joint Catastrophic Sick Leave Bank Committee.<br/>The decision of the Committee shall not be subject to the grievance procedure, but may be reviewed upon<br/>appeal to the Committee.</p>
<p>11.1.7.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee who has submitted a request to donate sick leave, and a<br/>certificated employee who receives leave from the Bank, shall each execute an agreement satisfactory to the<br/>Committee. The agreement will confirm the understanding of each that the donation of sick leave is voluntary.<br/>The agreement will also provide that each certificated employee agrees to indemnify and hold the Committee<br/>harmless from any claims, demands, or causes of action related to the donation.</p>
<p>11.1.7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No action taken by the Committee under this section shall be subject to the<br/>grievance procedure of this agreement. The Committee shall be composed of four (4) members, two (2) of<br/>which are appointed by the District and two (2) of which are appointed by the Desert Sands Teachers'<br/>Association (DSTA). A certificated employee dissatisfied with any action taken or decision made by the<br/>Committee concerning the Catastrophic Leave Plan herein provided, may submit a request for an appeal for<br/>reconsideration with additional supportive documentation. No request for appeal shall be considered by the<br/>Committee unless the request for appeal is submitted no later than ten (10) days after the action or decision in<br/>question. A tie vote represents a denial of the request.</p>
<p>The Committee shall have no jurisdiction to hear any request which is not submitted within the<br/>required time frame. The Committee shall review timely matters which are submitted to it. The Committee<br/>shall prepare a written report regarding the matter submitted to it. The report shall be submitted to the District<br/>Board of Education as an information item.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>The Committee shall be responsible for informing certificated employees of solicitation for<br/>donations earmarked for the Bank.</p>
<p>11.1.7.8 If any provision of this section is held to be unlawful, then this entire section shall<br/>be null and void. This section supersedes any obligation of the District under Education Code section 44043.5.</p>
<p>11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave:</p>
<p>11.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees may use up to seven (7) days' earned sick leave for<br/>personal necessity in any one school year. Personal necessity shall include:</p>
<p>11.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death or serious illness of a member of the unit member's immediate family;</p>
<p>11.2.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving the unit member's person or property, or the person or<br/>property of the unit member's immediate family, provided it is of such severity or seriousness so as to require<br/>the unit member's immediate attention;</p>

<p>11.2.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delay in returning to work because of unavoidable circumstances (flood, storm,<br/>vehicle breakdown, public transportation delay, etc.);</p>
<p>11.2.1.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three (3) days of the personal necessity leave, of the seven (7) days allowable,<br/>may be utilized by the unit member at his own discretion upon the following conditions:</p>
<p>11.2.1.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such days shall be charged against the unit member's sick leave;</p>
<p>11.2.1.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four (24) hours' written notice shall be required unless extenuating<br/>circumstances occur which prevent such notice given; in the event, the unit member shall make every reasonable<br/>effort to give advance notice;</p>
<p>11.2.1.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no accumulation from year to year of such days;</p>
<p>11.2.1.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration retains the right to refuse the unit member's request on a certain<br/>day if, in the opinion of the administrator, too many unit members select the same day;</p>
<p>11.2.1.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall not be required to give reasons for the use of such days;</p>
<p>11.2.1.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not be used to withhold services from the District;</p>
<p>11.2.1.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances shall personal necessity leave be available for extension<br/>of vacation/holiday, recreational purposes, or withholding of services; please see, 11.2.1.4.</p>
<p>11.2.1.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the utilization of personal necessity leave, a unit member shall make a<br/>reasonable effort to obtain prior approval from the appropriate management person.</p>
<p>11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnancy Disability Leave/Parental Leave:</p>
<p>11.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees covered by this Agreement shall be entitled to use personal illness</p>
<p>leave (sick leave) as set forth in this Agreement for disabilities caused, or contributed to, by pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom on the same terms and conditions governing leaves of absence</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>for other illnesses, injuries, or medical disabilities. Such leave shall not be used for child care, child rearing or<br/>preparation for childbearing, but shall be limited to those disabilities caused, or contributed to, by pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom.</p>
<p>11.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;length of such pregnancy disability leave, including the date on which the</p>
<p>leave shall commence and the date on which the employee's duties with the District are to be resumed, shall be<br/>determined by the employee and the employee's physician, subject to the following conditions: a teacher who is<br/>pregnant may continue in active employment as late into her pregnancy as she desires, provided she is able to<br/>properly perform her required duties and responsibilities and has submitted the necessary doctor's certificate.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: Sections 13.15 and 13.16 of this agreement provide as follows:</p>
<p>Credit for continuous service as defined above will be given for any one (1) year in which the<br/>employee worked seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the days school was in session.</p>
<p>Except as provided in Article 12, Evaluation Procedures, credit for advancement on the salary<br/>schedule shall be granted for any one (1) school year in which the employee rendered authorized paid service to<br/>the District for seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the days school was in session, exclusive of summer<br/>school. Only those days on which the employee is on authorized military leave, jury duty leave, authorized<br/>sabbatical leave, authorized conferences, or released time (pursuant to California's Government Code section<br/>3543.1c) shall be credited toward the seventy-five percent (75%) requirement, in addition to authorized on-site<br/>service days actually worked.</p>
<p>11.3 .2.1 Paternal Leave: An employee who is a father of a newborn child may use up to<br/>twenty (20) days of his accumulated sick leave as paternal leave for the birth of his child.</p>
<p>11.3.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoptive Leave: An employee adopting a child may use up to twenty (20) days of<br/>his or her accumulated sick leave for the purpose of adoption, limited, however, to picking up the child and<br/>caring for the child immediately following receiving the child.</p>
<p>11.3.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves in paragraphs 11.3.2.1 and 11.3.2.2 shall be counted against available<br/>leave under the Family Medical Care Leave Act.</p>
<p>11.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who are members of the bargaining unit shall be entitled to leave<br/>without pay or other benefits for disabilities caused, or contributed to, by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or<br/>recovery therefrom, when all current accumulated and differential pay sick leave has been exhausted. The date<br/>on which the employee shall resume duties shall be determined by the employee on leave and the employee's<br/>physician, provided, however, that the District management may require a verification of the extent of disability.</p>
<p>11.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leave policy shall be construed as requiring the Board of Education to grant<br/>leave with pay only when it is necessary to do so in order that leaves of absence for disabilities caused or<br/>contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, or childbirth be treated the same as leaves for other illness, injuries, or<br/>disabilities. Employees who desire additional parental leave over and beyond disability leave may be granted<br/>leave without pay for a period not to exceed one (1) full year.</p>
<p>11.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on pregnancy disability leave for one (1) semester or less shall be<br/>entitled to return to the same assignment held at the time such leave commenced, unless such assignment has<br/>been discontinued, in which case the employee shall be entitled to a comparable assignment. An employee on<br/>pregnancy disability leave for more than one semester shall be entitled to return to an assignment comparable to<br/>the assignment held at the time such leave commenced. In any case, the assignment of the employee upon<br/>return to work shall be comparable to that held at the time pregnancy disability began. &quot;Comparable&quot; means<br/>same educational level (primary or intermediate elementary; middle school; or high school assignment) and also<br/>means immediate assignment within major or minor teaching fields whenever possible, except by request of the<br/>employee and availability of the position.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>11.3.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the District determines that it may be appropriate to require additional<br/>verification of the extent of any of the disabilities referred to above, said verification shall be achieved through<br/>one of the following two methods—the option to be exercised by the affected employee. In the event the<br/>employee does not exercise an option upon request, the District may proceed with Section 11.3.6.1 below:</p>
<p>11.3.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District management may require a verification of the extent of the disability<br/>through a physical examination of an employee by a physician appointed by the District, at District expense; or</p>
<p>11.3.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional medical examination shall be conducted by the employee's physician<br/>at District expense. In the event the employee chooses to exercise this option, the employee's physician's<br/>verification shall contain the following language:</p>
<p>&quot;I understand that my verification of disability is to be used for the expenditure of public funds.<br/>I have read the foregoing verification of disability and declare under penalty of peijury that it is true and correct.</p>
<p>“Executed this_day of_, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20_, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at_,California, Riverside County.&quot;</p>
<p>11.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Code section 44977 states “The sick leave, including accumulated sick<br/>leave, and the five-month period shall run consecutively.”</p>
<p>11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bereavement Leave:</p>
<p>11.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be entitled to up to three (3) days of bereavement leave with<br/>pay in the event of the death of a member of the employee’s immediate family. Up to an additional two (2) days<br/>shall be granted if travel of 300 miles or more (one way) is required to attend or arrange for the funeral.</p>
<p>11.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, an immediate family member shall be limited to parent<br/>or grandparent, parent-in-law, grandchild, sibling, son/daughter-in-law, registered domestic partner or<br/>significantly bonded de facto parent or child.</p>
<p>11.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the death of a spouse or child, if the employee’s combined available<br/>personal necessity days and bereavement days total less than eight (8), the unit member may request additional<br/>days, not to exceed eight (8) days for bereavement and personal necessity, from the immediate supervisor. If the<br/>request is denied, the employee may appeal to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel.</p>
<p>11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident Leave:</p>
<p>Unit members will be entitled to industrial accident leave according to the provision of<br/>Education Code section 44984, for personal injury which has qualified for Workers' Compensation under the<br/>provisions of the Desert Schools’ Self-Insurance Program for Employees (SIPE), subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>11.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leaves shall not exceed sixty (60) days during which the schools of the<br/>District are required to be in session or when the employee would otherwise have been performing work for the<br/>District in any one fiscal year for the same industrial accident.</p>
<p>11.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to have the unit member examined by a physician<br/>pursuant to the provisions of SIPE, at District expense, to assist in determining the length of time during which<br/>the employee will be temporarily unable to perform assigned duties, and the degree to which a disability is<br/>attributable to the injury involved.</p>
<p>11.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days of absence deducted from sick leave or vacation leave immediately following<br/>exhaustion of industrial accident leave and as a direct result of the industrial illness or accident shall be reduced<br/>by the percent of compensation received by the employee.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial Leave:</p>
<p>Unit members will be provided paid leave for regularly called jury duty and to appear as a<br/>witness in court, other than as a litigant, for reasons not brought about through the connivance or misconduct of<br/>the unit member. Whenever possible, the member shall submit a written request for an approved absence no<br/>less than ten (10) days prior to the beginning date of the leave or the date called as a witness.</p>
<p>11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Leave:</p>
<p>Unit members shall be allowed military leave, subject to the provisions of applicable federal</p>
<p>and state law.</p>
<p>11.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Leave:</p>
<p>A certificated employee with permanent status may be granted a leave of absence without<br/>compensation for educational advancement for a period not to exceed one (1) full year. If the leave is to be in<br/>excess of twenty-five per cent (25%) of the teaching days scheduled for the school year, yearly increments in<br/>salary shall not be allowed. All conditions covering this leave shall be subject to approval by the Board of<br/>Education upon recommendation of the Superintendent.</p>
<p>11.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health or Hardship Leave:</p>
<p>11.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee with permanent status may be granted a leave of absence<br/>without compensation for health or hardship for a period not to exceed one (1) year. If the leave is to be in<br/>excess of twenty-five per cent (25%) of the teaching days scheduled for the school year, an experience<br/>increment in salary shall not be allowed.</p>
<p>11.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board approval is required prior to granting health or hardship leave. A statement<br/>from the employee's physician, stating that leave is necessary for health reasons, shall be required before<br/>approval is granted for health leave.</p>
<p>11.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Leave:</p>
<p>An employee may be granted a leave of absence without pay for personal reasons, not to exceed<br/>thirty (30) days, upon the recommendation of the Superintendent and with prior approval of the Board.</p>
<p>11.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave:</p>
<p>11.11.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave should be mutually advantageous to the individual and the District<br/>and is considered an investment in the employee's future value to the students, teachers, and administrators of<br/>the District. It may be granted for a period of one (1) year for study or research-travel.</p>
<p>11.11.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave must be preceded by at least seven (7) consecutive years of<br/>certificated service, all of which have been served as a regular full-time certificated person in the Desert Sands<br/>Unified School District. One (1) year of service is defined to be seventy-five per cent (75%) of the teacher days<br/>per year. Six (6) years must intervene between successive sabbatical leaves.</p>
<p>11.11.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lor the purpose of sabbatical leave, the school year during which the experience<br/>must occur is hereby defined as the period beginning August 20 and ending June 20 of the following year.</p>
<p>11.11.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave for Study:</p>
<p>A certificated person shall complete at least twenty-four (24) semester units of college and/or</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 24</p>
<p>graduate credit courses during a sabbatical year. At least twelve (12) semester units, or the equivalent, shall be<br/>completed during each semester or quarter while on leave. This unit requirement may be met by study in a<br/>foreign country in an accredited institution. A certificated person shall have a stated purpose and goal for taking<br/>college work so that it would be mutually beneficial to the individual and to the District (i.e., work toward an<br/>advanced degree, academic in-depth study in a subject matter in which he/she is teaching, or a research project<br/>directly related to the school or the District). Work toward a credential, such as an Administrative Credential or<br/>a Pupil Personnel Services Credential, is a personal obligation for self-advancement and may not mutually<br/>benefit the District and should not, in itself, be grounds for a sabbatical. This does not rule out the possibility of<br/>a person obtaining an advanced credential while completing the objectives of the sabbatical. Courses shall be<br/>exclusive of correspondence courses. Prior to such leave, the courses shall be subject to approval of the<br/>Sabbatical Leave Committee. Upon completion of the leave, and within sixty (60) days of return to duty, a<br/>written report on findings and conclusions, along with transcripts usable for reinforcement of teaching in the<br/>subject area, shall be submitted to the Office of Certificated Personnel for evaluation by the Sabbatical Leave<br/>Committee and forwarded to the Superintendent and the Board of Education. Not less than fifty percent (50%)<br/>of sabbatical leaves granted shall be for study.</p>
<p>11.11.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical Leave for Research-Travel:</p>
<p>Certificated persons on sabbatical leave for research-travel shall remain in this status at least<br/>four (4) months for each semester of leave granted. The application for leave shall include, in general terms, an<br/>outline of the proposed research and an itinerary of the proposed travel. The name &quot;research-travel&quot; is used,<br/>since the primary purpose of this sabbatical project is research of a nature which must be supplemented with<br/>travel. The research must have a direct contribution to the teacher's field and classroom activity. Sabbatical<br/>leave for research-travel must clearly show reinforcement of knowledge in the subject area through contact with<br/>people, culture, economy, government, and geography of the countries visited. This may be done by the<br/>employee identifying a problem and defining it to the point where he/she is able to offer evidence that travel and<br/>interaction with people during this research-travel leave will contribute to the solution of the problem. The<br/>research should be supplemented by such things as tapes of conversation, tapes of the informal as well as formal<br/>music, films of industrial areas, art centers, and art objects, etc. Upon completion of the leave, and within sixty<br/>(60) days of return to duty, a written report on findings and conclusions shall be submitted to the Office of<br/>Certificated Personnel for evaluation by the Sabbatical Leave Committee and forwarded to the Superintendent<br/>and to the Board of Education. A person shall be required to submit a copy, and copying rights for internal<br/>District use, of the entire sabbatical report. The report should set forth the teacher's reactions to the experience<br/>and include a statement of the benefits received from it. The Superintendent may, for good cause, authorize an<br/>extension of time for the report, not to exceed one semester for the purpose of completing the necessary<br/>requirements. A description of the trip alone will not satisfy the report requirement.</p>
<p>11.11.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for sabbatical leave must be submitted to the Sabbatical Leave<br/>Committee, through the Office of Certificated Personnel, and accompanied by a written recommendation from<br/>the immediate supervisor. Applications will be evaluated by the Sabbatical Leave Committee in terms of<br/>benefits to the District and individual. Applications must be submitted prior to February of the semester<br/>preceding that in which the leave is desired. Sabbatical leaves for less than one (1) year's duration may, on rare<br/>occasions, be granted for specific, special needs of the District. Quality of projects has first priority.<br/>Consideration shall be given to applications which provide the greatest opportunities for expanding professional<br/>contacts and, in case of advanced study, breadth of institutional experiences. No more than one (1) employee<br/>per school shall be granted a sabbatical leave.</p>
<p>11.11.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall receive fifty percent (50%) of his/her salary while on sabbatical<br/>leave for study or research-travel.</p>
<p>11.11.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee will be required to furnish a bond to guarantee his service to the<br/>District for at least two (2) years following the sabbatical leave. All sabbatical allotments will be returned to the<br/>District if the two full years are not completed.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 25</p>
<p>11.11.9 Effect of Sabbatical Leave on Retirement:</p>
<p>11.11.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated person on sabbatical leave shall be entitled to the increment for<br/>which he would have been eligible had he not been on leave. The leave shall not interrupt the teacher's progress<br/>on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>11.11.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabbatical leave counts toward retirement and the retirement contribution shall be</p>
<p>collected.</p>
<p>11.11.9.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case of injury to, or other illness of, the employee during leave which prevents<br/>his/her completing the purpose of the leave, the sabbatical leave will be terminated and all provisions for sick<br/>leave will apply. These provisions will take effect on the first day of the next pay period following notification<br/>of said illness to the Superintendent, verified by a medical doctor's report. Upon release by a medical doctor,<br/>the employee will return to regular duty for the remainder of the school year, to be assigned as needed in a<br/>certificated position at the discretion of the Superintendent. The subsequent year will be reassigned as if he/she<br/>had completed the sabbatical leave.</p>

<p>11.13.2 Any teacher granted leave who, during the period of such leave, accepts<br/>employment with another district, business, public agency or any other gainful employment without prior<br/>approval of the Board of Education shall be deemed to have resigned from his/her employment with the District.<br/>The Board shall not deny the employee on leave the right to accept employment necessary to sustain the original<br/>intent of the approved leave.</p>
<p>11.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unauthorized&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absence:</p>
<p>11.14.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unauthorized absence is defined as nonperformance of those duties and<br/>responsibilities assigned by the District and its representatives, including all duties and responsibilities as<br/>defined by the Education Code, rules and regulations of the Board of Education of Desert Sands Unified School<br/>District, and this collective Agreement.

<p>ARTICLE 12<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation shall be accomplished for the several categories of unit members as</p>
<p>follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary unit members and/or unit members who received an unsatisfactory<br/>performance evaluation in the prior year will be evaluated - at least once annually;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members may be evaluated at least once every other year.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least every five (5) years for unit members with permanent status who have been<br/>employed by the District for ten (10) years or more if the evaluator and the unit<br/>member consent to such time line. In order to be eligible for the five (5) year cycle,<br/>a unit member must be deemed to be “highly qualified” as defined in the No Child<br/>Left Behind Act (20 U.S.C. 7801) and his/her most recent evaluation must contain<br/>an overall rating which meets or exceeds standards.</p>
<p>For eligible unit members who are not teachers of “core academic” subjects, qualification<br/>requirements shall be the same as for teachers of “core academic” subjects.</p>
<p>For unit members who are not classroom teachers, the District and Association shall agree on<br/>appropriate comparable criteria.</p>
<p>Either the evaluator or the unit member may withdraw from this cycle at any time and such<br/>withdrawal shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. Upon request, the evaluator will meet with the unit<br/>member to explain the reasons for withdrawal; upon request the evaluator will provide a brief written<br/>explanation of the reasons for withdrawal.</p>
<p>12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the first four (4) weeks of a unit members’ first date of paid service at a<br/>school site, unit members will be notified by their evaluator that they will undergo formal evaluation. At this<br/>time, any other unit members may request evaluation.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within four (4) weeks after the unit member is notified that he/she will be formally<br/>evaluated pursuant to 12.2 the evaluator and the unit member will conduct a goal setting conference prepared to<br/>discuss the elements, goals, (maximum of 8 goals) and objectives which will form the basis for the evaluation.<br/>Each goal shall be covered by the California Standard for the Teaching Profession (“CSTP”). This does not<br/>preclude either party or both parties from having specific recommendations, goals, objectives, etc., in mind as<br/>part of preparing for and attending the meeting. However, the evaluator will not pre-enter the goals and<br/>objectives on the form. If the evaluator and the unit member cannot agree on the elements, the evaluator shall<br/>choose five (5) of the goals and the unit member shall choose three (3) of the total goals. In such an event, the<br/>unit member may attach his/her written response outlining those specific factors and/or conditions which, in<br/>his/her opinion, preclude the evaluatee from achieving the goals which will serve as the basis for evaluation.<br/>Such response shall not be deemed to modify the established goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The basis for evaluation shall be the CSTP, including student progress in relation to established<br/>goals and/or objectives.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first formal observation will be completed within the twelve weeks of the unit<br/>member’s first date of paid service at the site.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD andDSTA</p>
<p>Page 29</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conference&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;held&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the unit member within five</p>
<p>school days of the observation.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deficiencies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noted in the first observation, those deficiencies will be given in</p>
<p>writing to the unit member. The evaluator will develop a written action plan to assist and support the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>12.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second formal observation will be completed for probationary teachers and/or<br/>permanent teachers with an unsatisfactory evaluation within twenty (20) weeks of the unit member’s first date of<br/>paid service at the site, or if the first date of paid service at the site is at the beginning of the second semester, no<br/>later than May 1. For all other unit members, the second formal observation shall be completed no later than<br/>May 1. A second observation may be waived by mutual written agreement between the unit member and the<br/>evaluator if the unit member receives an overall Satisfactory first observation.</p>
<p>12.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second observation conference will be held with unit members within five<br/>school days of the observation.</p>
<p>12.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If deficiencies are noted in the second observation, those deficiencies will be given<br/>in writing to the unit member. The evaluator will develop a written action plan to assist and support the teacher.</p>
<p>The unit member will have at least thirty (30) instructional days from the second formal<br/>observation conference to demonstrate improvement before a final evaluation is issued. The evaluator will have<br/>the discretion to extend the number of days for excused absences provided the May 15 deadline is observed.<br/>The unit member may request one additional observation to be conducted by an administrator different from<br/>his/her primary evaluator or an administrator from a different site; in such event, the request will be honored.</p>
<p>12.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a second year probationary teacher is being considered for non-reelection, a<br/>conference will be held with the teacher by March 1.</p>
<p>12.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation shall be completed by May 15.</p>
<p>12.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least one (1) formal observation will be made during the evaluation period; a<br/>second observation may be waived as per section 12.7 by mutual written agreement between the unit member<br/>and the evaluator if the unit member receives an overall Satisfactory first observation. At least one such<br/>observation shall be announced at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the observation. A record of all<br/>formal observations and conferences will be made, and all necessary support material will be collected for<br/>attachment to the evaluation summary. Such materials will be distributed to affected members within ten (10)<br/>school days (i.e., days when school is in session). No bargaining unit member shall evaluate or observe other<br/>bargaining unit members for the purpose of evaluation. The evaluator shall use the forms approved by the<br/>District and Association. All materials must be made in enough copies for distribution as follows:</p>
<p>Personnel</p>
<p>Evaluator</p>
<p>Unit Member</p>
<p>12.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall take affirmative action to correct any cited deficiencies,<br/>based upon the evaluator's specific recommendations for improvement as stated in the written action plan per<br/>section 12.9 and his/her assistance in implementing such recommendations.</p>
<p>12.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data for evaluation summaries may include information from the following</p>
<p>sources:</p>
<p>12.14.1 Formal Observation - classroom visits of sufficient time to observe and assess<br/>instructional program and planning for the period covered by the observation;</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 30</p>
<p>Informal Observation - additional observations of unit member's performance and<br/>behavior which may be of lesser duration, lesser formality, and in other than the classroom environment.</p>
<p>12.14.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessment of student progress shall include a combination of factors including but<br/>not limited to (a) teacher and/or evaluator observation; (b) criterion-referenced tests; (c) anecdotal records made<br/>by evaluator or unit member; (d) mastery of level of proficiency standards; and (e) criterion-referenced tests.</p>
<p>12.14.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to personal observation, information which has been documented and<br/>found to be reliable by the evaluator and which relates to the performance of the unit member may be included<br/>in the evaluation process. Such information must be brought to the attention of the unit member before it may<br/>be included in the final evaluation summary.</p>
<p>12.14.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee’s right to request Association representation at a conference under<br/>this Article 12 is limited to those conferences wherein the unit member reasonably believes discipline may be<br/>recommended.</p>
<p>12.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Article, an unsatisfactory evaluation is defined as two (2)<br/>unsatisfactory ratings in Standards I-VI (CSTP).</p>
<p>12.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation content shall not be subject to the Grievance procedure.</p>
<p>12.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall not be adversely evaluated on the basis of elements of the<br/>educational program or maintenance of the physical environment for which the unit member has no authority to<br/>control. This shall not be read to absolve the unit member of the responsibility for bringing such matters to the<br/>attention of his/her evaluator or the appropriate management person. Unsubstantiated complaints shall not be<br/>referenced in the employee’s evaluation. An anonymous complaint which is not corroborated shall not be<br/>referenced in an employee’s evaluation.</p>
<p>12.18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event an administrator is unable to comply with any one or more of the<br/>timelines provided herein due to the unavailability of the unit member (i.e., unit member is absent on leave of<br/>absence, hired mid-semester or who transfers to the site mid-semester) such delays shall not preclude the<br/>administrator from proceeding with the evaluation of the affected unit member unless the administrator<br/>determines in his/her discretion that it is impracticable to do so; however, in no event will a unit member who<br/>works less than a full semester or 50% of the school year, whichever is greater, at his/her assigned site be<br/>subject to formal evaluation.</p>
<p>12.18.1 Upon request, the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services will meet with the<br/>Chapter President or designee to review concerns regarding compliance with the timelines set forth in this<br/>Article.</p>
<p>12.19 Specifically excluded from this procedure, as well as the contractual grievance<br/>procedure, are evaluations which result in Education Code section 44938 notices; such evaluations must be dealt<br/>with under the separate legal processes provided for in the California Education Code.</p>

<p>In lieu of health coverage, the District will contribute a sum equal to fifty per cent<br/>(50%) of the premium for Kaiser 2 (e.g. 2010-2011 Kaiser HMO rate is $10,125.00 thus annual sum of annuity<br/>shall be $5,063.00), to one of two District selected tax-sheltered annuity plans (TSA) for eligible bargaining unit<br/>members who present proof of coverage through a spouse or domestic partner, not employed by the District.<br/>Eligible bargaining unit members who present proof of coverage through a spouse or domestic partner or<br/>veteran benefits are eligible to participate in the TSA.</p>
<p>The parties re-affirm their support of work being done by the Health Insurance<br/>Committee and REEP representatives to continue looking for ways to contain the cost of health insurance and to<br/>educate district employees concerning health and welfare costs and benefits.</p>
<p>13.2.2 In addition to the current plans, the District and DSTA have agreed to offer an<br/>additional optional plan for: A Consumer Driven Health Plan (CDHP) featuring the Health Savings Account<br/>(HSA).</p>
<p>1. The District will make the following contributions for full time eligible employees<br/>towards the Health Savings Account HSA.</p>
<p>HSA - Deposits (Single)</p>
<p>$1,200.00 per year</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 32</p>
<p>HSA - Deposits (Family) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2,400.00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per year</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For probationary employees, the District reserves the right to make its<br/>deposits on such periodic bases throughout the year as the plan permits; for<br/>permanent employees, the deposits will be made twice yearly in July and in<br/>January;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax consequences of receiving the funding, establishing and using an HSA<br/>are the sole responsibility of the employee and the District specifically<br/>disclaims any liability therefore;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HSA is subject to various IRS rulings, statutes and regulations and the<br/>parties recognize that such rulings, statutes and regulations supersede or<br/>supplement the provisions of this agreement.</p>
<p>13.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an increase in premiums for the following school year and if the<br/>parties fail to reach agreement prior to July 1, the parties shall equally split the increased cost of each plan; in no<br/>event shall the District’s total contribution exceed 25% of the total cost of the increase of all plans for the plan<br/>year after applying pro rata the JPA rebate towards the total cost of increases.</p>
<p>E.g.: If the parties do not reach agreement by July 1, and if the cost of insurance increases by<br/>$1.1 million for that plan year, and the DSTA pro rata JPA rebate is $100,000.00 leaving<br/>$1,000,000.00 as the total increase for all plans, the District and the employee shall split the cost<br/>($1,000,000.00) of the increase 50/50 per plan after applying the rebate until the District’s<br/>overall contribution reaches a total of $250,000.00 (which is 25% of the total cost of the<br/>increase) or the parties reach agreement, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>As soon as the District receives notice of its new rates, it shall notify the Association and upon<br/>request begin negotiations concerning health and welfare benefits.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirees: The District shall continue health coverage for retirees fifty-five (55)<br/>years of age or over, up to age sixty-five (65) or until the retiree qualifies for Medicare, whichever occurs<br/>earlier, provided, however, that the retiree has been employed by Desert Sands Unified School District for at<br/>least eight (8) years immediately preceding his/her retirement and employed in a California public school<br/>district at least fifteen (15) years immediately preceding his/her retirement; this coverage commencing with<br/>those retirees who retired effective as of the close of the 1974/1975 school year, but no earlier.</p>
<p>13.3.1 a) For employees hired on or after July 1, 2006, health coverage will apply to<br/>retirees sixty (60) years of age or over. For purposes of this clause only, a permanent employee hired before<br/>July 1, 2006 who leaves the District and is reinstated as a permanent employee following July 1, 2006 shall<br/>remain in the pre-July 2006 hire group. Beginning July 1, 2012, the District will “pool” any savings between<br/>the actual costs of medical benefits for retirees and the agreed upon annual district contribution for per plan<br/>medical premiums (i.e., the “super composite annual medical cap”) and such savings will be applied to premium<br/>contributions on behalf of all eligible retirees receiving retiree medical benefits.</p>
<p>b) If, in the future, computations indicate there is no longer an overall group<br/>savings when computed against the “pooled” District contributions for current, eligible retirees, then in that<br/>event those retirees whose plans exceed that year’s “super composite annual medical cap” will assume, and<br/>equally share, the responsibility for paying the difference (“differential”). In the event that an eligible retiree is<br/>responsible paying a differential, such payment shall be made to the District on a minimally monthly basis.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 33</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.2 Retirees covered by this paragraph may, at their own expense, purchase group life<br/>insurance, group vision insurance and group dental insurance; provided that retirees make payments on at least a<br/>quarterly basis for such coverage.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties recognize that California Government Code section 53205 provides, in<br/>pertinent part, the following: “If the employer pays any portion of the premiums, dues, or other charges for the<br/>health and welfare benefits, any dividends paid or premiums refunded or other rebates or refunds under any of<br/>those health and welfare benefits up to the aggregate expenditures of the employer for the benefits are the<br/>employer’s property.” Thus, in any year when the District receives a rebate from its JPA (Joint Powers<br/>Authority) and negotiates to pay all or a portion of the increase in premiums, the District shall utilize that year’s<br/>premium rebate, if any, as a source to fund such payments. The JPA rebate, if any, shall proportionally be<br/>applied to offset the costs of health and welfare benefits of bargaining unit members, (i.e., if the DSTA<br/>bargaining unit members comprise 59% of the District’s JPA participants, then 59% of the JPA Rebate shall be<br/>applied to offset plan increases for DSTA bargaining unit members.)</p>
<p>The excess, if any, of the rebate amount over the increase shall be placed in an account to be expended on future<br/>health benefit increases. The Association recognizes that to the extent the District contributes toward the<br/>payment of premiums for health insurance, that such payments, regardless of source, are a component of<br/>compensation paid to or on behalf of the Association’s bargaining unit. The percentage of the rebate shall be<br/>determined on a yearly basis on or before November 1.</p>
<p>13.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member is granted unpaid leave of absence for less than three (3)<br/>months, he/she is required to continue payments to maintain coverage of current insurance benefits; when a unit<br/>member is granted unpaid leave of absence for a time period of three (3) months or longer, he/she shall have the<br/>option of continuing or not continuing payments to maintain coverage; the District will so notify the unit<br/>member upon granting the leave of absence.</p>

<p>13.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the product of the Joint Insurance Committee shall<br/>consist only on nonbinding recommendations.</p>
<p>13.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Insurance Committee is charged with the overall responsibility for<br/>analyzing available health insurance plans, both in terms of benefits and costs, and within the contractual<br/>obligations of district management securing bids for such plans. The Joint Insurance Committee shall make<br/>recommendations to the Association and the Assistant Superintendent, Business, no later than forty five (45)<br/>days prior to the cancellation date stated in the affected insurance contract. In the event the District determines<br/>to seek competitive bids from trusts and insurance carriers, the District will timely notify REEP of its intent in<br/>accordance with REEP by-laws. Further, the Joint Employee-Employer Insurance Committee shall meet to<br/>discuss from whom to seek bids, including REEP. Once the bids have been secured, the Committee shall study<br/>their proposals and create options and recommendations for the following fiscal year. The Joint Employee-<br/>Employer Committee recommendation shall be made to all bargaining units and shall communicate those<br/>recommendations within 10 working days. Upon receipt of the Insurance Committee recommendations, the<br/>parties will schedule a meeting to negotiate regarding these benefits and Article 13, Section 2.3.</p>
<p>13.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the Joint Insurance Committee will investigate self-insurance<br/>alternatives and will include self-insurance plans within its recommendations.</p>
<p>13.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties enter this Agreement fully aware that the Board of Education is<br/>committed to paying a single uniform amount per bargaining unit employee for group medical insurance.</p>
<p>13.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall begin its work no later than April 15.</p>

Site administrators shall make the<br/>final decision on such matters, including providing for mandated trainings, if any.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this clause, a full day of attendance is defined to mean 6 hours, 20<br/>minutes of training. Sites may schedule the trainings for a single day or in A day<br/>blocks of 3 hours and 10 minutes.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit employees who attend such days shall receive for each day of full<br/>attendance payment in the gross amount of $280. If the site utilizes A day blocks,<br/>unit members shall be paid $140 for attending each block.</p>

<p>Requests for prior approval must be submitted to the immediate supervisor's office no later than<br/>ten (10) days prior to the beginning of the course. Such requests for waiver will be granted or refused in no<br/>more than five (5) working days.

<p>All units earned in the Staff Development Program, including waivered lower division classes<br/>and prior approved upper division and graduate courses outside the regular Staff Development offerings, shall<br/>apply to the District Certificated Salary Schedule. Movement on the certificated salary schedule from Column<br/>D to E and F may be made without a Master's Degree using fifteen (15) Staff Development or prior approved<br/>semester units for each column movement (inclusive of hours/units, as stated in 13.23.1, over where the<br/>employee was first placed on the salary schedule). To be eligible for movement to Column G, a teacher must</p>

<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in professional conferences, workshops, teacher center programs, and<br/>DSUSD Staff Development Programs.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in a systematic program observing and analyzing teaching with<br/>required follow-up activities.</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District management shall designate an adequate number of professional growth<br/>advisors. Designated advisors shall hold a valid, clear California teaching or service credential and a<br/>Baccalaureate Degree from an accredited institution of post secondary education.

<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 38</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credential&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holder may amend his/her professional growth plan by adding,</p>
<p>deleting, or changing goals. The professional growth advisor shall sign a professional growth plan and initial an<br/>amendment to the professional growth plan provided it complies with Education Code section 44277.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professional&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advisor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall compel a credential holder to</p>
<p>include any particular activities in his/her professional growth plan and no advisor shall refuse to approve a<br/>credential holder's proposed plan, if it complies with Education Code section 44277.</p>
<p>(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of an arbitrary refusal by a professional growth advisor to verify</p>
<p>completion of the program of professional growth, the credential holder may appeal such action to the<br/>Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The professional growth advisor may require reasonable verification<br/>that the time keeping and elements of the professional growth plan have been accurately recorded.</p>
<p>(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will notify employees who are subject to this provision of their 150</p>
<p>hour professional growth requirement and provide them with appropriate forms, a list of advisors, and a copy of<br/>the District's professional growth program.</p>
<p>(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;section&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44277&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regulations thereunder are</p>

<p>ARTICLE 15<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize that optimum class sizes facilitate quality education.</p>
<p>Whenever administratively practicable, and whenever the District's financial resources allow,<br/>and whenever the facilities are available, the present policy of the Board of Trustees will be observed. The<br/>Board of Trustees will determine staffing allocations for the following school year. Such allocations are used<br/>for constructing master schedules, while providing for equitable distribution of human resources, consistent with<br/>enrollment needs at each school. The staffing allocations shall be determined according to the number of<br/>regular classroom teachers. “Regular classroom teachers” does not include nurses, counselors, librarians, and<br/>other similarly situated unit members.</p>
<p>Within the first 15 days of each grading period, the District will make reasonable efforts to<br/>adjust class sizes and caseloads in an equitable manner with a goal of maintaining a range of five (5) students<br/>per grade level and/or course title.</p>
<p>In addition, the above listed allocations are subject to modification for purposes such as, but not<br/>limited to, avoidance of split-grade classes or low enrollment classes, large group or experimental instruction*,<br/>team teaching limitations, changes in enrollment, student needs, master schedule limitations, or other reasonable<br/>situations.</p>
<p>*Large group or experimental instruction shall refer to and mean instruction provided to students in a non-<br/>traditional way that is supported by documented research.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 16</p>
<p>INTERMEDIATE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>Discipline of employees shall be for cause as defined in the California Education Code, written<br/>Board Policies, District rules and regulations, and/or the terms and provisions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>This clause does not apply to, nor does it limit, the District's rights to terminate employees<br/>pursuant to the Education Code, nor to the District's right to issue statutory letters of unprofessional conduct<br/>and/or incompetence. The District retains the right to terminate probationary and/or temporary employees and<br/>such activity is specifically excluded from the operation of this article and the grievance/arbitration procedure.</p>
<p>Discipline includes the following: Oral reprimand, written reprimand, docking of pay,<br/>suspension without pay for up to 15 working days.</p>
<p>The parties endorse the principle of progressive discipline subject to the following conditions:<br/>Progressive discipline contemplates that the level of discipline will fit the severity of the offense and, therefore,<br/>need not begin with the least serious form of discipline. The existence of forms of discipline short of<br/>termination in no way limits the District's authority to terminate employees pursuant to the Education Code.</p>
<p>If an administrator schedules a formal meeting with a unit member, the administrator shall<br/>notify the unit member of the subject to be discussed.</p>
<p>Any time an employee is to be interviewed concerning a matter, which the employee has reason<br/>to believe may lead to discipline, he/she has the right to request representation. Such right does not apply to<br/>conferences under Article 12, Evaluations, of this agreement, except as specifically provided for in Article 12.<br/>It is the employee's responsibility to request the representation. Management need not unreasonably delay the<br/>meeting in order to allow the employee to secure representation.</p>
<p>Any notice of discipline shall inform the employee of his/her right to appeal through the<br/>grievance procedure and of his/her right to request Association representation.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 17</p>
<p>MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS</p>

A copy of Education Code section 48900 is attached to this Agreement as<br/>Appendix E for information purposes only. Any information received by the teacher under this section shall be<br/>maintained in confidence, used only for the limited purpose for which it was provided and shall not be further<br/>disseminated by the receiving teacher.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 18<br/>CITIZEN’S COMPLAINT</p>
<p>A complaint regarding a unit member made to any member of the administration by any parent,<br/>student, or other person, shall be discussed with the unit member within five (5) working days following receipt<br/>of the complaint by the site administrator. For purposes of this Article, the phrase “other person” excludes an<br/>administrator or another bargaining unit member unless the administrator or bargaining unit member is<br/>complaining in their capacity as a parent.</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 42</p>

Neither the parent nor the unit member shall be represented at this initial<br/>meeting.</p>
<p>If there is no conference or if the matter is not resolved at the meeting to the satisfaction of the<br/>complainant, he/she may put his/her complaint into writing and submit the original to the unit member with a<br/>copy to the unit member's immediate supervisor. Once a written complaint is filed, the unit member shall be<br/>entitled, upon request, to be represented by the Association at all stages of the investigation and any future<br/>stages. The immediate supervisor shall investigate the complaint. If the investigation reveals that the complaint<br/>lacks merit, the administrator shall so note on the complaint and proceed no further with the matter; absent<br/>newly discovered evidence, such complaint shall not adversely impact the unit member's formal evaluation. The<br/>complainant may refer the matter to the Superintendent or his/her designee. The unit member shall be given<br/>notice and an opportunity to initial and date the written complaint and prepare a written response to such<br/>complaint. The response shall be attached to the written complaint. The unit member shall be given a copy of<br/>any summary or account of the resolution of the written complaint. Where the complaint is anonymous or the<br/>complainant declines to put the complaint in writing, nonetheless the site administrator may determine that the<br/>allegations are sufficiently serious to warrant proceeding with an investigation. Unsubstantiated complaints<br/>shall not form the basis for disciplinary action and shall not be referenced in the employee’s evaluation. An<br/>anonymous complaint which is not corroborated shall not be referenced in the employee’s evaluation.</p>
<p>If the complainant or unit member is dissatisfied, either may request a hearing before the Board<br/>of Education under Board Policy 1312.6.</p>
<p>A complaint initiated under this Article shall not result in disciplinary action (as defined in<br/>Article 16) unless and until the teacher has been informed of the complaint, the administrator has conducted a<br/>thorough investigation and the unit member has been provided an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>These provisions will not apply if law enforcement is conducting an investigation and requests<br/>or requires confidentiality of the process.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 19<br/>CHILD ABUSE</p>
<p>19.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Abuse Reporting:</p>
<p>Unit members are required to comply with the State's child abuse reporting laws and the<br/>District's reporting procedures.</p>
<p>19.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall:</p>
<p>19.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make available adequate supplies of forms and a list of the names, telephone<br/>numbers and addresses of agencies to which the reports are submitted;</p>
<p>19.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of a unit member accompanied by proof of having completed<br/>reporting requirements, the proper administrator will confirm to the unit member in writing that a report was<br/>submitted;</p>
<p>19.2.3 If a unit member is accused or reported as an abuser, appropriate administration<br/>will notify the unit member in a timely manner, after conferring with appropriate agencies or authorities, unless:</p>
<p>19.2.3.1 otherwise instructed by child protective agencies,</p>
<p>Agreement between DSUSD and DSTA</p>
<p>Page 43</p>
<p>19.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violates state or federal law, or</p>
<p>19.2.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it violates privacy rights guaranteed under law, or</p>
<p>19.2.3.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it would interfere with an ongoing investigation by child protective agencies.</p>
<p>19.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit member will take no reprisals or otherwise retaliate against person(s)</p>
<p>reporting the member, except for redress which may be available in a court of law.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 20<br/>COMPLETION OF MEET AND NEGOTIATION</p>
<p>20.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life of this Agreement, the District and the Association agree, except as</p>
<p>otherwise provided herein, or by mutual agreement, expressly to waive and relinquish their right to meet and<br/>negotiate with respect to matters covered and/or not covered by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>20.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year-round&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Openers:</p>
<p>If the District makes application for year-round Preliminary or Program Grants or decides to<br/>adopt year-round schooling for the next fiscal year or any ensuing year, the Association shall be notified and<br/>may request negotiations concerning impact on unit members. The District and Association shall thereafter<br/>meet and negotiate with respect to such request upon date of application. Such negotiations will not delay the<br/>implementation date of year-round school.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 21<br/>SAVINGS AND SEPARABILITY</p>
<p>21.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event any provisions of this Agreement are held to be contrary to the law</p>
<p>by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provisions will not be deemed valid and subsisting except to the<br/>extent permitted by law, but all other provisions will continue and remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>In the event such provisions are invalidated as described above, the parties shall, upon request,<br/>meet no later than fifteen (15) working days after such request to discuss the impact of such a holding and to<br/>negotiate possible alternative provisions.</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble</p>
<p>The Desert Sands Teachers Association (Association) and the Desert Sands Unified School District (District)<br/>strive to provide the highest possible quality of education to Desert Sands students. Both parties agree that<br/>optimum student performance can best be achieved if there is a fully qualified teacher in every classroom. In<br/>order for students to succeed in learning, teachers must succeed in teaching. The parties believe that all<br/>teachers, even the most skilled, must focus on continuous improvement in their professional practice.<br/>Accordingly, the parties agree to cooperate in the design and implementation of a professional development<br/>program to improve the quality of instruction through expanded and improved staff development, peer<br/>assistance, and professional accountability.</p>
<p>Teachers are valuable professionals who are entitled to have resources available to them to enhance continuous<br/>performance improvement.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support Providers will be trained to both offer peer assistance and to understand the specific<br/>functions of the PAR Program. The Council will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the<br/>Support Providers and make decisions regarding their continuation in the Program. The PAR<br/>Council may remove a Support Provider from the position at any time because of the specific<br/>needs of the PAR Program, inadequate performance of the Support Provider or for other reasons<br/>which serve the PAR Program’s best interest.

<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time Support Providers shall have a caseload determined by a ratio of Support Providers to<br/>Participating Teachers. This ratio is dependent on the amount of assistance provided to<br/>Participating Teachers as determined by the PAR Council and in consultation with the Support<br/>Providers.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While working with a Referred Teacher or a Volunteer Teacher, the Support Provider will meet<br/>with the principal or immediate supervisor to review and discuss the basis for referral to the<br/>PAR Program. The PAR Program encourages a cooperative relationship between the Support<br/>Provider, Referred Teacher or Volunteer Teacher, and the principal with respect to the process<br/>of peer assistance and review.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of the Participating Teacher or the Support Provider, the PAR Council may<br/>assign a different Support Provider to work with the Participating Teacher at any time during<br/>the year.
