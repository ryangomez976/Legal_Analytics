<p>4.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association representatives, who are not members of a particular school staff, shall<br/>have access to a campus during reasonable times during a school day, as long as they<br/>have signed in with the main administrative school office and the visit does not<br/>interrupt classroom instruction.</p>
<p>4.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use District email, bulletin boards and school mailboxes for<br/>Association business, subject to applicable codes and policies.</p>

<p>14.3.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because beginning teachers’ participating in the PAR program is not legally<br/>mandated, neither the CT nor the Joint Panel will make written reports<br/>regarding the individual beginning teachers, nor forward to the Board the<br/>names of individual beginning teachers who participated in the PAR<br/>program. The CT shall not participate in the performance review of the<br/>beginning teacher. All communications between the CT and the BT are<br/>confidential.</p>

<p>14.3.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because VPTS are not mandated by law to participate in the PAR program,<br/>neither the CT nor the Joint Panel will forward to the Board the names of<br/>individual VPTs or report on the outcome of</p>
<p>their participation. The CT shall not participate in the performance review of<br/>the VPT. All communications between the CT and the VPT are confidential.</p>

<p>17.1.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems relating to the performance of extra duties and/or adjunct duties (see<br/>Articles 5 and 6 Teaching Hours and School Year Calendar) are to be dealt with<br/>under this Article rather than Article XI Evaluation Procedures.

Only the<br/>Association has the right to initiate arbitration and to represent the employee in arbitration<br/>proceedings.

<p>59</p>
<p>17.3 Progressive Di scipline</p>

<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>FAMILY CARE AND MEDICAL LEAVE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>The following conditions, requirements and procedures shall apply when requests for family care<br/>or medical leave are made:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WorkWeek</p>
<p>The workweek is any week in which the employee is in paid status for all or part of the<br/>week. Weeks in which the only pay to the employee is for a paid holiday shall be excluded.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Eligibility</p>
<p>To be eligible for benefits under the Acts, an employee must have worked for the District:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</p>
<p>2. At least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons For Taking Leave</p>
<p>A leave request from an eligible employee must be granted for any of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birth of the employee’s child;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care for the employee’s child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s own serious health condition that keeps the employee from</p>
<p>perform &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his/her&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance Notice of Leave And Medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification</p>
<p>Employees will provide (1) advance written notice of the leave request and (2) medical<br/>certification whenever a serious health condition is involved.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the need for the leave is foreseeable, employees will provide thirty-day (30)<br/>advance written notice. If the need for the leave is unforeseen (i.e., an emergency),<br/>notice is required to be given as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave is to care for a child, spouse or parent with a serious health condition,<br/>or because of the employee’s own serious health condition, the employee will</p>
<p>provide &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health care provider or physician. The</p>
<p>m &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certification&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date of commencement of the serious health condition;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probable duration of the condition;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimated amount of time the health care provider will provide care;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmation that the serious condition of the child, spouse or parent<br/>warrants the participation of the employee; or, in the case of the employee’s</p>
<p>own &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condition,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certification that the employee is unable to</p>
<p>perform his/her job functions.</p>
<p>3 The District may require a second and third medical opinion regarding an</p>
<p>employee’s serious health condition, at the District’s expense. If the original leave<br/>granted is less than twelve (12) weeks, leave may be extended up to the twelve (12)<br/>week maximum, only with additional medical certification.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave is needed for planned medical treatment or supervision, the employee<br/>must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment or supervision to<br/>minimize disruptions to the District, outside of working hours whenever possible.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee’s advance notice and medical certification may be required to be<br/>given to the Personnel Office which will then determine the adequacy of the notice<br/>and medical certification and whether or not the leave will be approved/recommended<br/>for approval.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuation of Health Coverage and Other Job Benefit Plans</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee taking leave will continue to participate in any group health care<br/>benefits plan under the same terms and conditions, including any necessary co¬<br/>payments, in which the employee was enrolled prior to the first day of the</p>
<p>leave. Co-payments are due monthly. Failure to pay the premium within thirty (30)<br/>days of the due date may result in termination of benefits coverage.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee fails to return from the leave for any reason other than the<br/>recurrence, continuance, or onset of a serious health condition, the employee will<br/>be liable to the District for premiums paid for maintaining the employee’s health<br/>coverage.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may, at his/her expense, continue to participate in all other employee<br/>benefit plans offered by the employer during the leave period.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave.</p>
<p>An employee may take leave intermittently (e g., in blocks of time), or by reducing a normal</p>
<p>work schedule, in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the leave is for the birth or placement of a child, leave may be taken<br/>on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis if the District approves.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule whenever it is<br/>medically necessary to care for a family member with a serious health condition,<br/>or because the employee is seriously ill and unable to work the employee’s</p>
<p>regular &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;schedule.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of scheduling intermittent leave when approved, full-time<br/>employees shall have entitlement to sixty (60) working days of leave. Part-time<br/>employees’ leave entitlement shall be prorated based on the employee’s FTE.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substitution of Paid Leave and Other Leave Requests</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees must use paid leave and family care leave concurrently if the reason for<br/>the paid leave meets the requirements of the Family Care Leave Section C.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any paid or unpaid leave taken which meets the requirements of Section C</p>
<p>of this memorandum will be counted as part of the employee’s family care leave<br/>entitlement, if the employee is so notified at the time the leave begins.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity</p>
<p>Women on maternity leave will not start using family care leave until their disability period is<br/>over (i.e., when their physician takes them off disability after the birth of their child). Thus,<br/>although family leave due to an employee’s serious health condition would normally run concurrently<br/>with sick leave where the employee is out for three (3) days or more, this will not apply in the<br/>case of disability due to maternity.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spouses Who Work For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District</p>
<p>Spouses employed by the District are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12 work weeks of<br/>family leave for the birth or placement of a child with them. There is no limitation of entitlement<br/>for leaves taken for the serious health condition of their child.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Period of Eligibility</p>
<p>The 12 month period for determining entitlement commences on the first day of the leave.</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority. Employee Benefits and Break in Service</p>
<p>An employee on leave will not lose any seniority or employment benefit that accrued prior to<br/>the start of the leave. An employee on unpaid Family Care Leave (not paid leave such as<br/>vacation or sick leave) will not accrue additional benefits, such as vacation, sick leave or similar<br/>benefits, during the leave. The leave will not constitute a break in service for purposes of<br/>longevity and seniority.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoration of Employment and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitness for Duty Report</p>
<p>Employees returning from an approved leave will be reinstated to the same or equivalent<br/>position. Employees returning from an approved medical leave for their own serious health<br/>condition may be required to provide a fitness for duty report to return to work.</p>

<p>DOMESTIC PARTNERS</p>
<p>In California, and also under this Agreement, a domestic partnership shall be established when all of the<br/>following requirements are met:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both partners have a common residence. The term “common Residence” means that both domestic<br/>partners share the same residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess the common<br/>residence be in both of their names. Two people have a common residence even if one or both have<br/>additional residences. Domestic partners do not cease to have a common residence if one leaves the<br/>common residence but intends to return.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons agree to be jointly responsible for each other’s basic living incurred during the domestic<br/>partnership, the term “basic living expenses” means shelter, utilities, and other costs directly related to<br/>the maintenance of the common household of the common residence of the domestic partners. It also<br/>means any other cost, such as medical care, if some or all of the cost is paid as a benefit because a<br/>person is another person’s domestic partner. The term “joint responsibility” means that each partner<br/>agrees to provide for the other partner’s basic living expenses if the partner is unable to provide for him<br/>or herself.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither person is married nor a member of another domestic partnership.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two persons are not related by blood in any way that would prevent them from being married to<br/>each other in California.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons are at least eighteen years of age.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either of the following:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons are members of the same sex.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or both of the persons meet the eligibility criteria Under Title II of the Federal<br/>Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 402(a) for old-age insurance<br/>benefits, or Title VXI of the Federal Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C.</p>
<p>Section 1381 for aged individuals.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither person has filed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the California Secretary<br/>of State pursuant to applicable law which has not been terminated pursuant to applicable law.</p>
<p>In order to receive any benefits in this Agreement for domestic partners, all requirements set forth above<br/>must be met, and the District must receive a copy of the registered form of the Declaration of Domestic<br/>Partnership which has been returned to the domestic partners from the California Secretary of State, (Family<br/>Code section 298.5). The burden of proof is on the eligible employee seeking benefits- Eligible employees<br/>who may obtain benefits pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately notify the District in writing whenever<br/>the domestic partnership is terminated. (Family Code section 299).</p>
