<p>Date: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 30, 2014</p>
<p>Subject: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorandum of Understanding-Implementation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of PLC Meetings</p>
<p>Board Members<br/>Jeffrey Holland<br/>Diane Howe<br/>Scott Otsuka<br/>Tracy Pittman<br/>Jeff Randall</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding is to acknowledge the one year agreement<br/>between the Dry Creek Teachers Association and Dry Creek Joint Elementary<br/>School District regarding the implementation of Professional Learning<br/>Community (PLC) meetings.</p>
<p>For the purposes of developing and further implementing PLC's, schools shall<br/>dismiss students in grades K through 8<sup>th</sup> fifty (50) minutes early on Mondays<br/>during the 2014-2015 school year. This will result in thirty-two (32) PLC early<br/>release days during the 2014-2015 school year. Six (6) instructional minutes per<br/>day in grades K through 8<sup>th</sup> will be added to the remainder of each regular<br/>student instructional day Tuesday through Friday. All minimum days shall be<br/>eliminated except for five (5) parent conference days and the last instructional<br/>day of the school year. Kindergarten daily instructional minutes shall remain the<br/>same as the 2013-2014 school year for those sites that maintain a morning and<br/>afternoon Kindergarten schedule.</p>
<p>Together, the District and DCTA shall adhere to these Professional Learning<br/>Community guiding principles to reflect best practices in implementing PLC early<br/>release time:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of our schools is to see to it that ail students learn at high<br/>levels, and the future of our students depends upon our success in<br/>achieving that purpose.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot help all students learn at high levels if we work in isolation.<br/>We must build a collaborative culture and engage in a collective effort to<br/>achieve our purpose.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not know if we are helping all students learn unless we focus on<br/>results and use evidence of student learning as part of a continuous<br/>improvement process.</p>
<p>To that end, administrators and teaching teams will use PLC release time to<br/>perform the following functions, including but not limited to: 1) establishing a<br/>guaranteed and viable curriculum, unit by unit, 2) monitoring student learning</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drycreek.k12.ca.us">www.drycreek.k12.ca.us</a></p>
<p>on an ongoing basis through team developed common formative assessments,<br/>and B) using the results of common assessments to improve professional<br/>practice, identify concerns regarding student achievement, and identify students<br/>needing intervention or enrichment.</p>
<p>The timing of the 50 (fifty) minute PLC early release meetings will occur at a<br/>reasonable time after dismissal of students so that the meeting will end by the<br/>conclusion of the 7 (seven) hour work day. It is understood by both the District<br/>and DCTA, that staff/faculty meetings will be moved to Mondays which may<br/>commence directly after PLC meetings.</p>
<p>Article 5 section A.3 of the agreement between the District and DCTA shall be<br/>implemented for the 2014-2015 school year as follows: The classroom teacher<br/>shall report twenty-five (25) minutes before his/her class/period and remain<br/>thirty(30) min-utes after the end of-his/her last-elass/period remain until the<br/>completion of his/her seven (7) hour work day.</p>
<p>It is understood by both the District and DCTA that, in accordance with Article 5<br/>section E of the DCTA Agreement, PLC early release time will not be scheduled by<br/>site or District administration to extend beyond the seven (7) hour workday<br/>during designated &quot;meeting free&quot; weeks. The classroom teachers, at their own<br/>discretion, may extend the PLC meeting beyond the seven (7) hour workday<br/>during &quot;meeting free&quot; weeks.</p>
<p>Article 5, Section E.7 of the DCTA Agreement shall be implemented for the 2014-<br/>2015 school year as follows: Site administration shall provide four (4) weeks per<br/>trimester free of site meetings (Faculty, Grade Level, Track, Department).</p>
<p>In an effort to maintain consistency with the Middle School sports program, it is<br/>understood by the District that coaches, under the direction of the site<br/>administration, may conduct practices or games directly after student dismissal.</p>
<p>In order to implement PLC early release time, both parties agree to develop an<br/>agreed upon academic/work calendar for 2014-2015 (see attached proposed<br/>calendar). It is understood this calendar is subject to approval by the Board of<br/>Trustees. This calendar will be drafted as a separate &quot;Tentative Agreement&quot;<br/>between the Dry Creek Joint Elementary School District and The Dry Creek<br/>Teachers Association.</p>
<p>Both parties agree to discuss the effectiveness of the implementation of PLC<br/>early release time at approximately the midpoint of the 2014-2015 school year.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding shall constitute or create a past<br/>practice or be deemed precedential in any manner whatsoever or in future<br/>bargaining manners.</p>
<p>Please sign and return this memorandum to my office to acknowledge receipt<br/>and agreement that the District will be implementing PLC early release time<br/>during the course of the 2014-2015 school year.</p>
