<p>ARTICLE V-GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a claim that there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a specific<br/>provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “aggrieved person” is any teacher making the claim.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “party in interest” is any person who might be required to take action or against whom action might be<br/>taken in order to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to decide, at the lowest possible administrative level, equitable<br/>solutions to the problems that may from time to time arise affecting the welfare or working conditions of<br/>teachers. Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be<br/>appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any teacher having a grievance to<br/>discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member of the administration, and to have the<br/>grievance adjusted without intervention by the Association, provided that the adjustment is not<br/>inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement and that the Association has been given an opportunity to<br/>be present at such adjustment and to state its views.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits specified at each<br/>level should be considered to be maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the process.</p>
<p>The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in this<br/>grievance procedure by the end of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the<br/>following school year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the parties hereto are encouraged to<br/>endeavor to resolve the matter as soon as practicable, without compromising the purpose of this process.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Resolution</p>
<p>Any teacher who believes he/she has a grievance shall present the grievance orally to the immediate<br/>administrator within ten (10) days after the aggrieved person knew, or reasonably should have known, of the</p>
<p>circumstances which form the basis for the grievance. Failure to do so will render the grievance null and void.<br/>The administrator shall hold discussions and attempt to resolve the grievance. It is the intent of this informal<br/>meeting that at least one personal conference be held between the aggrieved person and the immediate<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>D. Grievance will be processed in accordance with the following steps:</p>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>If the grievance is not settled during the informal discussion and the aggrieved person wishes to press the<br/>matter, the aggrieved person shall present the grievance in writing to the immediate administrator within ten<br/>(10) days after the oral decision by the administrator. The administrator shall respond in writing within ten<br/>(10) days after receipt of the grievance. The written grievance shall include:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of the specific grounds of the grievance, including names, dates and places necessary for a<br/>complete understanding of the grievance.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the provisions of this Agreement which are alleged to have been violated or misapplied.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of the reasons why the immediate administrator’s proposed resolution of the problem is<br/>unacceptable.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of specific actions requested of the District, which will remedy the grievance.</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance, or if no disposition has been made<br/>within five (5) days of such meeting, the grievance shall be transmitted to the Superintendent’s designee.<br/>Within five (5) days from the receipt of the grievance, the Superintendent or designee shall meet with the<br/>aggrieved person on the grievance and shall indicate the disposition of the grievance in writing within five (5)<br/>days of such meeting and shall furnish a copy thereof to the Association and the aggrieved person.</p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision of the Superintendent, or if no decision is<br/>forthcoming, he/she may appeal to the Grievance Committee. The Grievance Committee shall be composed of<br/>five (5) members; two (2) Board members, appointed by the Board; two (2) teachers, appointed by the<br/>Association; and one (1) person appointed from the general public by the four (4) designated members.</p>
<p>The Grievance Committee shall hold such hearing(s) and/or inquiries as it deems appropriate, and the parties<br/>to the grievance shall have full opportunity to present such testimony, witnesses and/or other presentations, as<br/>they deem appropriate.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days of the above hearing, the Grievance Committee shall present its majority<br/>recommendation to the Board of Trustees. Minority report(s) may be submitted to the Board of Trustees, but<br/>such reports shall be for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees shall receive and consider the Grievance Committee’s majority report and such<br/>minority report(s) and/or direct advocate presentation as may be submitted. The Board shall then issue a<br/>decision to either accept or reject the majority report.</p>
<p>If the majority report is rejected, the Board must cast at least four (4) votes (80% of Board membership) to<br/>reject.</p>
<p>Acceptance of the majority report shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>If the Board rejects the majority report recommendation, the Board shall convene again, within five (5) days of<br/>the rejection and announce its proposed resolution to remedy the grievance. Within five (5) days after<br/>announcement of the proposed resolution, the Board shall again convene and entertain final statements by the<br/>parties regarding the proposed resolution. After the presentation of final statements, the Board shall issue its<br/>final decision regarding the grievance.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance arises from an action of authority higher than the aggrieved person’s immediate administrator,<br/>the aggrieved person may present such grievance at Step 2 of this procedure.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall deny to any teacher his/her rights under State or Federal constitution and laws.<br/>No probationary teacher may use the grievance procedure in any way to appeal discharge or a decision of the<br/>Board not to reemploy. No tenured teacher shall use the grievance procedure to dispute any action by the<br/>Board, which is applicable to the State tenure laws.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by the administration to adhere to decision deadlines constitutes the right for the aggrieved person to<br/>adhere to the submission deadlines shall mean that the aggrieved person is satisfied with the latest decision<br/>and waives any right to further appeal. However, nothing prevents the parties from extending the dates by<br/>mutual agreement.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of a grievance takes place, the aggrieved person is required to conform to the original<br/>direction of his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of<br/>the participants.</p>
<p>ARTICLE Vl-WORK DAY AND YEAR</p>
<p>A. Based on the premise that teachers are professional and, as such, are to perform a wide variety of complex and<br/>interrelated services to children, it also follows that the time frame for the provision of these services varies<br/>greatly. As a consequence, the time frame for a working day is considered a minimum span of time.</p>
<p>1. The teacher’s normal workday shall be comprised of six and one-half (6 1/2) hours, as determined by the</p>
<p>site administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers shall enjoy at least a thirty (30) minute duty-free uninterrupted lunch break, exclusive of the<br/>workday.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided by rule of the site administrator, teachers are required to be present at their<br/>respective rooms, and to open them for admission of pupils not less than thirty (30) minutes before the<br/>time prescribed for commencing school.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall also make themselves available for parent-teacher conferences and other<br/>meetings/activities/duties as required. The District shall provide for one (1) roving substitute one (1) day<br/>per month at each site for the purpose of conducting IEP meetings</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teacher Work Year shall consist of one hundred eighty-eight (188) days.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-Sharing</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Job-Sharing” shall refer to two or more teachers sharing one (1) full-time teaching assignment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A job-sharing situation shall be entered into voluntarily by the teachers involved. Each job-sharing<br/>situation must be approved by the site administrator, the Superintendent and the School Board.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job-sharing assignments shall be filled only by teachers who have jointly agreed to work together.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities of an assignment by two job-sharers shall be divided and/or allocated according to a plan<br/>designed by the job-sharers, with the concurrence of their immediate supervisor. The terms of the plan<br/>shall be embodied in a separate contract approved by the District and each participant.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid leaves authorized by the “Agreement” may be covered by the other job-sharer providing both job-<br/>sharers have mutually agreed to such a plan. When it is not possible for such sharing of substitute time, a<br/>regular substitute will be employed and sick leave shall be charged to the individual who is absent.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seniority of teachers involved in job-sharing shall be determined in accordance with State law and<br/>generally accepted practices.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher who begins a job-share shall maintain his/her position on the salary schedule and be paid a<br/>prorated share of his/her salary based on the percent of the full-time position being worked. Annual step<br/>advancement on the salary schedule shall be in accordance with Article XIII Salaries/Retirement<br/>Incentives. Beginning with the 2011-12 school year, if a teacher should return to a full-time position while<br/>having only fulfilled one (1) of two (2) years of part-time service required to advance one (1) whole step<br/>on the salary schedule, he/she shall advance to the next whole step on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants in a full-time shared position are entitled to share the benefits and leave days according to<br/>a full-time teacher. Sharing of these benefits and leave days will be at the discretion of the teachers<br/>involved, but must be approved by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher involved in job-sharing who wishes to work full-time shall be assigned the first open position<br/>for which he/she is professionally qualified at the beginning of the next school year, or as soon as possible<br/>thereafter.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter of application for participation in a job-sharing assignment shall be submitted to the site<br/>administrator and the Superintendent.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A letter of response to the application shall be sent to the employee within forty-five (45) days of<br/>application.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared job programs shall be assessed by the site administrator and the Superintendent between January<br/>15 and April 15 to determine renewal for the following school year.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district retains the right to terminate the program any time after the third school month if in the<br/>opinion of the district, the program is not in the best educational interest of the students. Both team<br/>members shall be consulted and given the opportunity to produce evidence in support of continuance of<br/>the program prior to such termination. The district shall also objectively survey the views and attitudes of<br/>the parents of the students prior to termination. If the district elects to terminate the program, one member<br/>of the team shall be assigned as a full-time teacher for the class. The other team member shall be retained<br/>as a half-time teacher for the remainder of the school year and be subject to reassignment. The assignment<br/>of the class for the full-time teacher shall be made by the district after consulting with team members.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-Time Teaching</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Part-Time” shall refer to a less than full-time teaching position for which an individual voluntarily<br/>applies. It shall generally be applicable to seventh (7) and eighth (8) grade teaching positions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-Time shall follow the provisions set forth in article VI (C) Job-Sharing, with the following<br/>exceptions.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out-of-class responsibilities of a part-time assignment shall be proportionate to the amount of time<br/>worked. Such responsibilities shall be designated in a plan drawn up between the teacher and his/her<br/>immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits and leave days shall be proportionate to the amount of time worked.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences shall be covered by a regular substitute.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part C. No. 3 shall be omitted.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Development Days</p>
<p>Beginning with 1999-00 school year, the Teacher Work Year shall consist of one hundred and eighty -six</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>(186) regular work days and two (2) professional development days pursuant to Senate Bill 1193 (“buy<br/>back days”).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional development days (“buy back days”) shall be designated on the District’s<br/>Student/Certificated Calendar for 1999-00 as August 19, 1999,</p>
<p>September 24, 1999 and May 5, 2000 and by mutual agreement thereafter.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the requirement of SB 1193, to be eligible for his/her daily rate of pay, on<br/>calendar designated pro fessional development days (“buy back days ”) a teacher must be present<br/>for the entire day designated as a professional development day. If the teacher is unable to attend a<br/>scheduled professional development day due to illness or emergency, the teacher shall be required<br/>to make-up the day within the current school year at a time mutually agreed upon between the<br/>teacher and his/her site administrator. In no event shall a teacher be eligible to use personal leave<br/>for any absence on a designated professional development day.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the two additional professional development days pursuant to SB 1193 that increase the<br/>Teacher Work Year to 188 days, the District shall provide compensation to bargaining unit<br/>members who are in attendance on those days by dividing the amount stated at each step of the<br/>salary schedule by 186 and multiplying that remaining amount by 2 and adding that result to the<br/>amount stated at that step.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that funding for professional development days under SB 1193 is reduced or<br/>discontinued in 1999-2000, or any year thereafter, or in the event the funding amount of $270 per<br/>teacher per professional development day pursuant to SB 1193 does not increase annually, the<br/>District shall have the automatic and unilateral right to revert to the 186 day Teacher Work Year<br/>and to reduce each step of the certificated salary schedule in an amount determined by using the<br/>method of calculation set forth in subparagraph 3 above.</p>
<p>F. Preparation and Planning Time</p>
<p>The District agrees to schedule four (4) minimum school days within the school year for the<br/>purpose of providing Preparation and Planning time for bargaining unit members.</p>

<p>Q. Catastrophic Illness and Injury</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Illness and Injury Benefit</p>
<p>As set forth by the provisions of this section, any bargaining unit member may donate sick leave<br/>credits to the Catastrophic Leave Bank for use by another bargaining unit member when that<br/>bargaining unit member, or a member of his/her family, suffers from a catastrophic illness or<br/>injury.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness” is defined as (1) a critical illness or injury where the long-term<br/>diagnosis may be terminal without intensive medical treatment for the employee or a<br/>member of the employee’s immediate family, and (2) the illness or treatment is expected<br/>to incapacitate the employee or a member of the unit member’s immediate family for an<br/>extended period of time such that the employee must be absent from work for an<br/>extended period of time and such absence creates a financial hardship for the unit<br/>member because he/she has exhausted all available fully paid sick leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Immediate family” is defined as husband, wife, son, daughter, or stepchild who is<br/>living at home, or the mother and father of the unit member.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sick Leave Credit” as used in the context of this provision means that number of sick<br/>leave days which are given by a donating bargaining unit member to the Catastrophic<br/>Leave Bank for use by another bargaining unit member who is experiencing a<br/>catastrophic illness.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Available Fully Paid Sick Leave”. For purposes of this article available fully paid sick<br/>leave means that fully paid sick leave earned in the current year plus fully paid sick leave<br/>accumulated from prior years that is otherwise available for employee’s own catastrophic<br/>illness or the catastrophic illness of a member of the unit member’s immediate family.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by a Joint Committee of two (2)<br/>members appointed by the Association and two (2) members appointed by the District.</p>
<p>3. Eligibility To Use The Bank</p>
<p>Sick leave credits may be donated to a bargaining unit member for a catastrophic illness if all of<br/>the following requirements are met:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the Catastrophic Leave Bank is voluntary, however, contribution to the<br/>Bank is required in order to be eligible to receive donated sick leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit faculty member who is suffering from a catastrophic illness, or whose</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>immediate family member is suffering from a catastrophic illness, submits a written<br/>request for donated sick leave. The affected bargaining unit member shall provide<br/>written verification of this catastrophic illness or injury from a licensed physician.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affected bargaining unit member has exhausted all available fully paid sick leave, and<br/>the only remaining paid leave available to the employee who is suffering from a<br/>catastrophic illness/injury is the five school months of differential pay leave. Where the<br/>catastrophic illness or injury is suffered by an immediate family member, the employee<br/>must have exhausted all fully paid leave available to care for a family member.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Committee determines that the bargaining unit member is eligible to access the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank because the unit member or his/her immediate family member<br/>is incapacitated as set forth in paragraph 2(a) above, the unit member shall receive an<br/>initial donation of up to a maximum of thirty (30) work days.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the unit member anticipates that he/she will need additional donated leave<br/>beyond the initial thirty (30) work days, the unit member must submit to the Committee a<br/>written request, together with written verification from a licensed physician attesting to<br/>the need for continued catastrophic leave, at least ten (10) work days prior to the<br/>expiration of the initial leave donation. If the Committee concurs in the unit member’s<br/>request, the Committee may allocate donated leave to the unit member up to a maximum<br/>of twenty (20) additional working days.</p>
<p>4. Procedure</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eligible bargaining unit member who wishes to access the Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>must submit a request in writing to the Committee.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a unit member must have donated to the Catastrophic Leave Bank in order to be<br/>eligible to request donated leave, unit members shall be provided the opportunity to<br/>contribute to the Bank from the first teacher contract day through October 15. Any unit<br/>member who is a participant in the Catastrophic Leave Bank may elect during the period<br/>from the first teacher contract day through October 15 of any year to withdraw from the<br/>bank on the condition that all unused sick leave contributions made by the unit member to<br/>the Bank shall remain in the Bank.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members must have at least fifteen (15) days of accrued leave as of the first teacher<br/>contract day to be eligible to donate, and all unit members who wish to participate in the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank shall make an initial contribution of one (1) day of sick leave<br/>and agree to donate up to two (2) additional days for a maximum of three (3) days as</p>
<p>determined by the Committee in response to employee utilization of the Bank.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that as of the first teacher contract day in any school year the bank has a<br/>balance of less than fifty (50) days, the Committee may require an additional day of<br/>donated leave from all existing participants in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of time that donated sick leave may be used by the recipient<br/>bargaining unit member shall:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not exceed the five (5) school months of differential pay leave referred to in 3.a.3)<br/>above for a unit member’s own catastrophic illness or injury. All donated sick leave<br/>shall be coordinated and run concurrently with the unit member’s five (5) school<br/>months of differential pay leave and shall be applied so as to provide the unit<br/>member, to the extent such donated sick leave permits, with full pay rather than<br/>differential pay.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not exceed the number of work days specified in Section 3.d. and e. for the<br/>catastrophic illness or injury of a unit member’s immediate family member.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and PRTA shall establish procedures regarding the banking of unused<br/>donated sick leave. Once finalized, these procedures shall become a part of the parties’<br/>collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bargaining unit member who receives donated leave credit pursuant to this section shall<br/>use any leave credits that she/he continues to accrue on a yearly basis prior to receiving<br/>paid leave from the Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall, to the extent possible, not<br/>disclose the nature of the illness/injury except as is necessary to process the request for<br/>withdrawal and to demonstrate that all eligible employees have received an equal<br/>opportunity to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By November 15 of each year, the District shall notify the Committee of the following:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of donated days in the Bank.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The names of participating members.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) day of April and June, the District shall notify the Committee of the<br/>total number of days remaining in the Bank on the last day of the previous month.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall immediately notify the Committee at any time that the number of days<br/>in the Bank has been exhausted.</p>
<p>5. Exempt From Grievance Article</p>
<p>This Catastrophic Leave Bank provision shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII-CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as budget and other conditions permit, the Board shall endeavor to attain class sizes of twenty-<br/>five point five (25.5) pupils in Kindergarten, twenty-six (26) pupils in grades one through three, and<br/>thirty (30) pupils in grades four through eight.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the goal of the Board to maintain the above class sizes after attainment is effected and, further,<br/>to study and assess the feasibility and/or desirability of class sizes even smaller than those reflected in<br/>paragraph A, above, and to implement and maintain such smaller class sizes as expeditiously as may be<br/>feasible.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study, assessment and implementation commended in paragraph B, above, shall be a bilateral<br/>endeavor handled through the vehicle of the Liaison Committee, as provided in Article XIV of this<br/>Agreement. The parties agree, however, that all final determinations, to include remedies, techniques of<br/>attainment and determination of the budget and other conditions, as reflected in this Article, shall lie<br/>with the Board.</p>

A representative of the association may be present at<br/>the request of the unit member.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member may appeal the final decision of the District Administration to the Board of<br/>Trustees whose decision shall be final.</p>
