<p>I. AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding<br/>agreement (“Agreement”) by and between the Governing Board of the Newman-<br/>Crows Landing Unified School District (“District”) and the Newman-Crows<br/>Landing Teachers Association/California Teachers Association/National<br/>Education Association (“Association”), an employee organization.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Section 3540-3549 of<br/>the Government Code (“Act”).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect from July 1, 2013, to<br/>June 30,2014.</p>
<p>II. RECOGNITION</p>
<p>The District recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative for full-time<br/>classroom teachers, temporary classroom teachers, part-time classroom teachers (if<br/>on contract), resource teachers, teachers on special assignment, lead teachers, and<br/>special education teachers. Excluded will be the superintendent, principals, director<br/>of psychological and counseling services, head teacher/administrator<br/>(administrative duties required), project director, nurse, psychologist, summer<br/>school teachers, substitutes, and positions designated by the District as<br/>management, supervisory and/or confidential.</p>
<p>III. WAGES</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated salary schedule for 2013-14 is set forth in Appendix B.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Appendix C for extended teacher pay schedule.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as practicable, returning regular teachers will be paid in twelve (12) equal<br/>salary payments on the last working day of each month.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daily rate of a teacher’s pay will be the yearly rate divided by the number of<br/>days teachers may be required to work by this Agreement.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not later than November 15, the District will, upon request, furnish the<br/>Association with the placement (by step years and units) of unit personnel on the<br/>respective salary schedule as of November 1.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary and part-time teachers shall be paid based upon their appropriate<br/>placement on the salary guide and the ratio of work time to full-time service under<br/>the Agreement.</p>
<p>IV. HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District can increase instructional time within the seven and one-fourth (7 %)<br/>hour teacher workday, provided that preparation periods are not affected by such<br/>increase.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall receive no less than a thirty-five (35) minute uninterrupted, duty-<br/>free lunch period.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may leave without special permission on Fridays, minimum days, Early<br/>Release Days, and days preceding holidays when their professional<br/>responsibilities have been completed.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of work days per school year shall not exceed a maximum of one<br/>hundred eighty-one (181). The District agrees to consult with the Association<br/>prior to scheduling any make-up days.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to assigned classroom teaching duties, teachers shall perform, as<br/>reasonably required, and without additional compensation, professional duties<br/>which occur outside of scheduled class hours and outside of the regular school<br/>day for students. Required staff meetings will be limited to a maximum of one (1)<br/>hour per week to a maximum of four per month.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a substitute is required where preparation periods can not cover<br/>the absence, teacher(s) can be assigned to cover students from another class, in<br/>addition to their own class (“doubling up”)- The teacher(s) assigned those extra<br/>students shall receive compensation or proportional bank day equal to the current<br/>teacher substitute pay for district employees times the fractions of both the class<br/>assigned and the length of the assignment.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a substitute is required during a teacher’s preparation period, the<br/>District shall first seek volunteers; if no teacher volunteers, the District would<br/>assign a teacher to substitute. Compensation for the assignment shall be as per the<br/>extended teacher pay schedule per full class period covered.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may choose to serve as a substitute teacher during his/her non-student<br/>contact period. When a total number of these bank periods equal the total number<br/>of contract periods for one full day, then one (1) bank day will accrue. The rate of<br/>pay shall be in accordance with the current teacher substitute pay for district<br/>employees for the one (1) period or the teacher may bank the period.</p>
<p>a. A teacher may choose to serve as a substitute teacher during his/her prep<br/>period, and in lieu of payment, receive a period towards a “bank day”.</p>
<p>Page 5 of 59</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank day(s) can be used in lieu of using a day of accumulated leave.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank days require prior approval from the site administrator before<br/>more than one (1) day in succession is taken.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank days cannot be taken during the last work week in a school year<br/>or used to extend a holiday period.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank days must be used within the school calendar year, and are not<br/>accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bank day is not used by the end of the school year, the teacher will be<br/>paid at the current substitute rate for district employed staff. Any days or<br/>portions thereof not used prior to May 31<sup>st</sup> will be added to that year’s final<br/>pay warrant.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjunct duties shall be distributed among teachers on an equitable basis.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the starting time for school is delayed or school is canceled because<br/>of fog or other conditions, the time persons covered by the terms of this<br/>Agreement are to report to school shall be delayed by the same unit of time as the<br/>pupils are delayed or shall be canceled as the case may be.</p>

<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide twenty (20) preparation periods, equally distributed<br/>throughout the school year as practical, for elementary preparation. The<br/>Association and the District will collaborate on the placement of these days.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers selected to teach seven (7) periods will receive additional compensation<br/>of l/7th of their salary based on their placement on the salary schedule scale,<br/>excluding all stipends, if the District is seeking a teacher to teach a seventh (7th)<br/>period. If the assignment is for less than a full school year, the compensation will<br/>be prorated accordingly.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers will be solicited to remedy the identified staffing needs.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most qualified volunteer shall be granted the assignment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things being equal, selection will be based upon seniority.</p>

<p>XIX. UNPAID FAMILY CARE LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee who has served the District more than one continuous year shall be<br/>eligible to take unpaid family care leave under the provisions of California<br/>Government Code section 12945.2 and the Federal Family and Medical Leave<br/>Act of 1993, 29 U.S.C. section 2601 et seq. “One continuous year” as used in this<br/>regulation shall mean that the eligible employee must have worked at least 1,250<br/>hours in the year preceding the request for leave.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family care leave may be used for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of the employee’s child;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The placement of a child with the employee in connection with the<br/>employee’s adoption of a child;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious illness of the employee’s child;</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee’s own serious health condition;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious health condition of the employee’s parent or spouse. “Serious<br/>health condition” means an illness, injury, impairment or physical or<br/>mental condition which warrants the participation of a family member to<br/>provide care during a period of the treatment or supervision and involves<br/>either:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential health care<br/>facility, or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care<br/>provider.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this regulation, “child” means a biological, adopted or foster<br/>child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis as<br/>long as the child is 18 years of age or an adult dependent child. For purposes of<br/>this regulation, “parent” means a biological, foster or adoptive parent, a<br/>stepparent, or legal guardian.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family care leave may be taken in one or more periods but shall not exceed a total<br/>of 12 weeks within a 1-year period unless a longer leave is agreed upon by the<br/>District and the employee.</p>
<p>When used in conjunction with the maximum pregnancy disability leave under<br/>Government Code section 12945, family care leave shall be no more than one<br/>month unless the District and the employee agree otherwise (Government Code<br/>section 12945.2).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of family care leave, the employee may elect or may be<br/>required by the District to use his/her accrued vacation leave, other accrued time<br/>off, or any other paid or unpaid time off negotiated with the District. Sick leave<br/>shall be used during the period of family care leave only if the employee and<br/>District agree.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall continue to be entitled to participate in pension and retirement<br/>plans, and supplemental unemployment benefit plans to the same extent and under<br/>the same conditions as applied to an unpaid leave taken for any purpose. The<br/>District will continue to pay the employee’s monthly health care premium for a<br/>total of 12 weeks in any one-year period when the employee is on family care<br/>leave. Should the employee’s leave exceed 12 weeks in a one-year period, the<br/>employee may continue coverage in any health and welfare plans at his/her own<br/>expense. Should the employee fail to return to work after his/her family care leave<br/>and any supplemental leaves negotiated with the District, the District may recover<br/>any premiums paid for maintaining the coverage unless the continued absence is<br/>due to the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition or other<br/>circumstances beyond the control of the employee.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall retain his/her employee status with the District during the<br/>leave period, and the leave shall not constitute a break in service for purposes of<br/>longevity, seniority, or any other employee benefit plan.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee’s need for family care leave is foreseeable, he/she shall give the<br/>District reasonable advance notice. If leave is needed for a planned medical<br/>treatment or supervision, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to schedule<br/>the treatment or supervision to avoid disruption of District operations. This<br/>schedule shall be subject to the health care provider’s approval.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee’s request for leave to care for a child, spouse or parent who has a<br/>serious health condition or the employee’s own serious health condition shall be<br/>supported by a certification from the health care provider or person requiring care.<br/>This certification shall include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date on which the serious health condition began;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probable duration of the condition;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimate of the amount of time the health care provider believes the<br/>employee needs to care for the person requiring care;</p>
<p>Page 17 of 59</p>
<p>d. A statement that the serious health condition warrants the participation of<br/>a family member to provide care during a period of treatment or<br/>supervision of the person requiring care.</p>
<p>If an additional leave is needed when the time estimated by the health care provider</p>
<p>expires, the District may require the employee provide re-certification in the same</p>
<p>manner as specified above.</p>
<p>XX. CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates a<br/>member of the employee’s family which incapacity requires the employee to take<br/>time off from work for an extended period of time to care for that family member,<br/>and taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the employee<br/>because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave and other paid time<br/>off.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who is, or whose family member is, suffering from a catastrophic<br/>illness or injury must submit a written request to the Superintendent for a<br/>donation of eligible leave credits and provide medical verification of the<br/>catastrophic illness or injury as required by the District. As in the case of all sick<br/>leave use, the continued use of donated eligible leave credits shall be subject to<br/>appropriate medical verification by physicians selected by the District. The<br/>request will be reviewed by a confidential committee comprised of the<br/>Superintendent and the Association president for approval.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may transfer on a voluntary basis a portion of his or her<br/>accumulated leave credits up to five (5) days at a time, in daily increments, to<br/>another employee because of catastrophic or life-threatening sickness or accident.<br/>An employee may transfer credits by signing an authorization identifying the<br/>employee and the number of days of accumulated leave to be transferred to the<br/>named employee. Sick leave may not be transferred by any employee who,<br/>following the transfer of the designated leave, will have less than fifteen (15) days<br/>of accumulated sick leave. (Ed. Code 44043.5)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible leave credits means sick leave accrued to the donating employee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee who is voluntarily contributing the leave credits shall be<br/>responsible to fill out the necessary form to initiate this action and to deliver that<br/>form to the Superintendent’s secretary.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sick leave credit transfers to the Catastrophic Leave Fund shall be irrevocable<br/>and nonrefund able. Transferred sick leave credits shall be utilized only for the<br/>precipitating catastrophic illness or injury. All unused transferred sick leave</p>
<p>credits shall revert to the Catastrophic Leave Fund. The bank will be administered<br/>jointly by the NCLTA President/Designee and the Superintendent/Designee.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee may receive transferred leave credits from another employee unless<br/>receiving employee has exhausted all accrued paid leave credits.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of time for which donated leave credits may be used shall<br/>not exceed a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.</p>
<p>XXI. JOB SHARE</p>
<p>Job-sharing shall refer to two (2) unit members on regular contracts sharing one (1)<br/>teaching assignment. Two unit members must share an assignment for the complete<br/>school year. Job applications for a job-sharing assignment for the following school year<br/>shall be filed with the District no later than March 1. The District shall approve or deny<br/>requests and notify, in writing, the applicants of its decision by May 1. If a request is<br/>denied, the applicants shall be notified, in writing within ten (10) working days of the<br/>denial, of the specific reasons for the denial. Notwithstanding other provisions of this<br/>Agreement, job-sharing unit members’ wages, benefits, and paid leaves shall be prorated<br/>relative to the actual time worked. In no event shall the total amount of health and<br/>welfare benefits for the job-sharers exceed the amount the District would have paid if the<br/>position had not been shared.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each job-sharing unit member shall receive a prorated salary schedule increment<br/>each year. Salary advancement on the pay schedule will be pro-rated according to<br/>the assignment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of the two unit members, a job-sharing assignment may be renewed<br/>provided the two unit members notify the District prior to March 1. In the event<br/>the two unit members fail to notify the District of their desire to continue the job¬<br/>sharing assignment, or in the event the District does not approve the continuance<br/>of the assignment, the unit members shall be returned to full-time assignments.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member on a regular contract is in a job-sharing assignment and elects to<br/>return after the first year to full-time teaching, the unit member will be returned to<br/>an available, comparable position, but no guarantee can be given it will be the<br/>same position he/she occupied at the time the job-sharing was granted.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the second year of a job share, if a member wishes to continue in the job<br/>share he/she is only entitled to the prorated FTE that he/she is occupying. In order<br/>to return to 1 FTE, he/she would need to apply for any available new openings.<br/>The employee would be placed in an available, comparable position before any<br/>new employee hires.</p>
<p>Page 19 of 59</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the job sharing assignment, the participant with the highest District<br/>seniority will have first choice at retaining the position. The second participant<br/>retains all transfer rights.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one participant of a job sharing team is absent due to illness or other paid<br/>leave, the remaining participant is encouraged to exchange days for the absent<br/>participant.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STRS Contributions will be based on the percentage of the assignment,<br/>determined by State formula. (One half of service toward retirement will be<br/>credited for each year in the job sharing program, assuming a 50/50 job share).</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At formal K-5 parent conferences (those scheduled twice a year) parents may<br/>request in writing that both participants be present. If no formal request is made,<br/>only the participant working that day needs to be present. Informal parent<br/>conferences will be conducted by either, or both, participants as determined by<br/>parent or teacher requests. When using the semester option, parent conferencing<br/>will only apply to the semester the participant is working.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff work day(s) and 6-12 parent teacher conferences will be attended by both<br/>participants. Faculty meetings, collaborative days, and department meetings will<br/>be attended by the working teacher. It will be the responsibility of the working<br/>partner to disseminate all information covered at faculty, collaborative and<br/>department meetings to the non-attending teacher.</p>
<p>XXII. SENIORITY</p>
<p>Seniority, as used in this Agreement, shall be defined as the length of<br/>continuous service to the District as a certificated teacher.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniority will accrue beginning with the unit member’s initial date of<br/>service.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members with the same initial date of service shall have their<br/>seniority determined by lot at the beginning of their first year of<br/>service. The lottery shall be conducted in the presence of at least two<br/>(2) Association representatives. Once the lottery is used to determine<br/>the unit member’s seniority placement, that seniority placement shall<br/>remain in effect while the unit member is in the service of the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member on a District approved leave of absence, other than to<br/>a non-bargaining unit position, shall continue to earn seniority while<br/>on leave.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member’s seniority shall accrue during layoff.</p>
<p>Page 20 of 59</p>
<p>E. When all other factors are essentially equal, the senior volunteer for<br/>any vacancy shall be given first right of refiisal.</p>

Days will be<br/>defined as “days the district office is open.” The minimum posting will be<br/>three working days. If a transfer/reassignment results in a new opening, the<br/>resulting position may be filled after three days from its posting. Posting<br/>includes written notice displayed at each site and mail notice to employees<br/>requesting it.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for transfer to take effect during the school year must be made<br/>within ten (10) working days of the posting of vacancy.</p>

<p>3. Involuntary Transfer/Reassignment: Compliance, Program, Student Population<br/>Shifts</p>
<p>When the District perceives a need to consider involuntary transfers, the<br/>following steps shall be followed:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to effecting an involuntary transfer/reassignment, the District shall<br/>identify grades and/or subject areas that will be affected by state and/or<br/>federal non-compliance, enrollment shifts and/or definable program change<br/>which will necessitate the need for personnel changes.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent/designee shall meet with the teacher(s) whose<br/>assignment(s) may be affected.</p>
<p>1. Volunteers will be solicited to remedy the identified staffing<br/>need(s).</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees wanting a transfer out of a school participating in a Year<br/>Round Education Program to a school not participating in such a program<br/>will be considered for vacancies for which they are qualified.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on the proposed Year Round site and site administrators will<br/>work together to determine track placements of all special programs.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If agreement cannot be reached, the teacher’s position along with the<br/>recommendation of the designated school site principal shall be presented<br/>to the Superintendent for final determination.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Transfer to a Different Track and/or Grade Level at Year Round<br/>SitelsI</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track and grade level assignments and notification for the following<br/>school year shall be completed no later than May 1. Changes after that<br/>date shall only be made for significant enrollment shifts.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should it become necessary to transfer a teacher to different track and/or<br/>grade level, the District will first ask for volunteers to change tracks<br/>and/or grade levels. If no one volunteers, the least senior teacher will be<br/>transferred within the same grade level.</p>
<p>XXIV. SAFETY</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will make a reasonable effort to provide for each teacher’s safety.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that a teacher’s work environment remains safe, any teacher who<br/>observes a working condition thought to be unsafe shall report such condition to<br/>his/her immediate supervisor.

<p>Page 23 of 59</p>
<p>6. Employees shall immediately report, in writing, cases of assault or threatened<br/>assault suffered by them in connection with their employment to their immediate<br/>supervisor.</p>
<p>XXV. CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>1. Subject to the financial condition of the District, the building facilities available,<br/>the availability of qualified teachers, classroom safety and the best interests of the<br/>students as determined by the District, the Board agrees to meet and negotiate<br/>with the Association prior to implementing any District-wide change in class size<br/>policy.</p>
<p>2. ^Desirable class policies are as follows:</p>
<p>Elementary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25</p>
<p>Junior High &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25</p>
<p>Secondary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25</p>

<p>All combination classes ** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22</p>
<p>Learning Handicapped &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12-15</p>
<p>* It is understood and agreed that the District cannot necessarily implement<br/>desirable class sizes, and that the District must consider a variety of factors,<br/>including but not limited to impact on learning, revenues, physical facilities,<br/>educational programs, and teaching loads in determining class size.</p>
<p>^^Combination classes are composed of students of different grade levels.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils will be distributed as equitably as practicable among the teachers assigned<br/>to that grade level or subject area.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request of either party, the District will fulfill its obligations under this<br/>Article by a meeting open to all teachers affected and/or the Association’s<br/>representative each year class size exceeds the numbers listed above.</p>
<p>XXVI. EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>1. One of the principle objectives of the District and the Association is to maintain a<br/>high quality of education, provide District assistance so improvement can take<br/>place, and/or to take a variety Of appropriate actions which may include<br/>termination as well as other actions required to protect the District’s interests and<br/>those of the teacher.</p>
<p>Page 24 of 59</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall schedule a meeting within the first forty-five (45) working days<br/>of the school year with each teacher to determine goals and objectives, using:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The California Standards for the Teaching Profession,</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation rubric criteria,</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreed upon measures of supervision,</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support requirements to be provided by the evaluator,</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans for mutually monitoring the teacher’s performance status.</p>
<p>Permanent teachers shall establish goals focused on four (4) of the six (6)<br/>California Standards for the Teaching Profession. Probationary teachers shall<br/>establish goals and objectives focused on two California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession. In this case, the standard for maintaining an effective<br/>learning environment is one of the two required goal areas for all probationary<br/>teachers. No more than two objectives per goal can be required for all teachers.</p>
<p>If an evaluator and any evaluatee cannot agree on one or more of these matters,<br/>the evaluatee may request a review by the Superintendent or his/her designee,<br/>whose decision will be final.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary employees shall be evaluated at least twice each year during<br/>probationary service. The first evaluation shall be completed and reports filed no<br/>later than the last school day of the first semester/trimester and not before the<br/>meeting to determine goals and objectives. The final evaluation report shall be<br/>completed and filed no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the end of the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation of each certificated employee not in probationary status shall be made<br/>every other year.

<p>Differentiated Supervision</p>
<p>The term “differentiated supervision” refers to a set of professional development<br/>options which tenured teachers may select instead of or in addition to a formal<br/>classroom observation. These options are all deemed equal and appropriate. (See<br/>Appendix D for Differentiated Supervision Flow Chart.)</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional Evaluation</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Coaching</p>

<p>The term “traditional evaluation” shall refer to the set of professional<br/>development options including pre-conferences, observations, post conferences<br/>and final evaluations written on the District Evaluation of Teaching Performance<br/>form.</p>
<p>Teachers who select an alternative evaluation, shall be granted a satisfactory<br/>rating in their end of the year evaluation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of unsatisfactory evaluations, the certificated employee shall be<br/>evaluated in consecutive years until a satisfactory evaluation is obtained.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation shall be completed and a report filed no sooner than ninety (90)<br/>instructional days into the school year (unless the teacher and site administrator<br/>have mutually agreed to an earlier date) and no later than thirty (30) calendar days<br/>prior to the end of the school year.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traditional Evaluation procedure shall normally include three (3)<br/>observations annually. More or fewer observations may be scheduled. The<br/>District shall notify the teacher being evaluated of the reasons for additional<br/>observations. The evaluation procedures shall include one lesson observation<br/>annually of at least thirty (30) minutes, but no longer than fifty (50) minutes. At<br/>the request of the evaluatee, the initial observation may be during a mutually<br/>agreed upon day and time.</p>
<p>a. Prior to the planned observation, a pre-conference shall be held<br/>between evaluator and teacher regarding teacher’s objectives,<br/>methods and materials planned for the teaching-learning situation<br/>to be evaluated and the criteria to be used by the evaluator as per<br/>the District Pre-Observation Conference Form.</p>
<p>Page 26 of 59</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations shall consist of evidence gathered through anecdotal<br/>records and/or video, to be determined by the teacher, post-<br/>observation analysis sheet, and the summary of the lesson written<br/>on the District Formal Classroom Observation Summary Form.<br/>The Summary Form of the observation shall be given to the<br/>teacher within ten (10) working days of the observation.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that an observation contains identified concerns, and<br/>evidence that teaching standards are not being met which could<br/>lead to an unsatisfactory evaluation, the evaluatee may request a<br/>review by the Superintendent or his/her designee, whose decision<br/>is final. Identified concerns will be presented in writing to the<br/>teacher. In addition, a suggested action plan will be outlined for<br/>implementation. The teacher has a choice of participating in a<br/>voluntary assistance program while continuing with the traditional<br/>evaluation process which will consist of subsequent evaluations.<br/>Or the teacher may select to continue with the traditional<br/>evaluation process consisting of subsequent evaluations and<br/>principal support only.</p>
<p>1. Principal Support Only</p>
<p>If the teacher selects to follow a traditional evaluation process the<br/>action plan will be implemented through the support of the<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the participating teacher is following a traditional<br/>path in the evaluation process, a second formal<br/>observation will be scheduled no sooner than thirty<br/>(30) instructional days.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event performance standards are not met, the<br/>site administrator must again present in writing to the<br/>teacher the identifiable concerns. The action plan is<br/>revisited, modified as necessary, and the teacher will<br/>continue implementing components of the plan.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third formal observation will be scheduled following<br/>the continued implementation of the action plan. The<br/>observation will be no sooner than thirty (30)<br/>instructional days after components of plan have been<br/>completed at a mutually agreed upon date.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of year evaluation is given. If a teacher<br/>receives a “1” (practice not consistent with standards<br/>and expectations) as a cumulative rating in any one or</p>
<p>Page 27 of 59</p>
<p>more of the six standards the teacher will be<br/>automatically referred to the Peer Assistance Review<br/>process.</p>
<p>2. Voluntary Assistance Support</p>
<p>a. If the teacher selects to follow a path of voluntary<br/>assistance an action plan will be developed that could<br/>include the assistance of a consulting teacher, ,<br/>professional training, or the development of an<br/>Individual Professional Plan (IPP). This assistance<br/>plan will be reached through mutual agreement<br/>between the teacher and site administrator. If<br/>agreement cannot be reached, the final decision will be<br/>the responsibility of the Joint Panel.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second formal observation will be scheduled<br/>following the reasonable implementation of the action<br/>plan. The observation will be scheduled no sooner than<br/>thirty (30) instructional days after components of plan<br/>have been completed, at a mutually agreed upon date.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that performance standards are not met,<br/>the site administrator must again present in writing to<br/>the teacher the identifiable concerns. The action plan is<br/>revisited, modified as necessary, and the teacher will<br/>continue implementing components of the plan.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third formal observation will be scheduled following<br/>the continued implementation of the action plan, no<br/>sooner than thirty (30) instructional days after<br/>components of plan have been completed, at a<br/>mutually agreed upon date.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of year evaluation is given. If a teacher<br/>receives a “1” (practice not consistent with standards<br/>and expectations) as a cumulative rating in any one or<br/>more of the six standards the teacher will be<br/>automatically referred to the Peer Assistance Review<br/>process.</p>
<p>8. Teachers selecting an alternative supervision procedure shall conference prior to<br/>January 31, with an administrator to determine future steps or to move to<br/>traditional evaluation.</p>
<p>Page 28 of 59</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the year evaluation shall be in writing and a copy of the evaluation<br/>report shall be furnished to the evaluatee.

If the evaluatee is not performing in a satisfactory manner, the<br/>report shall describe the areas of needed improvement and recommendations as to<br/>how improvement can be effected. The evaluatee has the responsibility to<br/>implement the recommendations of the evaluator.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall not be held responsible for any specific matters relating to the<br/>educational program over which they have no authority.</p>

<p>XXVIII. GRIEVANCE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is the person or persons covered by the terms of this<br/>Agreement or the Association making the claim.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is the claim by one or more grievants that there has been a<br/>violation of a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “party in interest” is any person who might be required to take action or<br/>against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “immediate supervisor” refers to the supervisor having immediate<br/>jurisdiction over the grievant.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Days” refers to days on which teachers are in attendance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to an alleged violation of this<br/>Agreement. Both parties agree these proceedings will be kept as informal<br/>and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>grievant having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any<br/>appropriate member of the administration, and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted provided the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important the grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the<br/>time limits specified at each level should be considered to be maximums.<br/>Failure to proceed to the next step within the specific time limit will<br/>preclude any further appeal on the grievance. The time limits may,<br/>however, be extended by mutual written agreement of the Superintendent<br/>and the Association.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One: Before filing a formal grievance, the grievant shall attempt to<br/>resolve it by an informal conference with his/her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two: Within twenty (20) days after the grievant knew or should<br/>have reasonably known of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance,</p>
<p>the grievant must present the grievance in writing on the district grievance<br/>form to his/her immediate supervisor, with a copy to the Superintendent<br/>and the Association. This shall be a statement of the grievance, including<br/>the specific provision of the Agreement allegedly violated, the<br/>circumstances constituting such alleged violation, the decision rendered at<br/>the informal conference, and the specific remedy sought. The immediate<br/>supervisor shall communicate his/her decision to the grievant,<br/>Superintendent and the Association in writing, within ten (10) days after<br/>receiving the formal grievance. If the immediate supervisor does not<br/>respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Thr ee: If the grievant believes the decision at Level Two to be<br/>incorrect, he/she may within ten (10) days appeal the decision on the<br/>appropriate district grievance appeal form to the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee. Within ten (10) days after the receipt of the written grievance by<br/>the Superintendent, the Superintendent or his/her designee will meet the<br/>grievant and/or the grievants representative to resolve the grievance. The<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee shall communicate his/her decision to<br/>the grievant, the immediate supervisor, and the Association within fifteen<br/>(15) days. If the Superintendent or his/her designee does not respond<br/>within the time limits provided, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Four: If not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level<br/>Three, or if there has been no written decision, the Association may<br/>submit the grievance to the advisory arbitration within twenty (20) days.<br/>The parties shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator. Should they be<br/>unable to agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) days of submission of the<br/>grievance to arbitration, the grievance shall be submitted to the State<br/>Conciliation and Mediation Service.</p>
<p>The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing. The arbitrator will be without<br/>power or authority to alter, amend or modify this Agreement, or to make<br/>any decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law or<br/>which violates the terms of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator<br/>will be submitted to the Superintendent, grievant and the Association.</p>
<p>All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including but not limited to, per<br/>diem expenses, travel and subsistence expenses, and the cost of any<br/>hearing room, will be borne equally by the District and the Association.<br/>All other costs will be borne by the party incurring them. Expedited<br/>arbitration may be used by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Five: Subject to timely inclusion, the decision of the arbitrator shall<br/>be acted upon not later than the next regularly scheduled Board meeting<br/>whose agenda date was subsequent to the receipt of the decision. If the<br/>Board does not sustain the arbitrator’s decision, the Board will provide the</p>
<p>grievant and the Association with a written statement of its decision within<br/>five (5) days after its scheduled Board meeting.</p>
<p>4. General Provisions as to Grievances</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing or pendency of any grievance shall in no way operate to<br/>impede, delay, or interfere with the rights of the District to take the action<br/>which is the subject of the grievance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and record dealing with the processing<br/>of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance file.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken against any grievant, any party of<br/>interest, any member of the Association, any unit member, or any other<br/>participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such lawful<br/>participation.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may be represented at all stages, except Level One by<br/>himself/herself or, at his/her option, by a representative of the Association.<br/>The Association has the right to be present at all levels above Level One.<br/>The Association shall have the right to grieve on alleged violations of<br/>rights specifically granted the Association in this Agreement. The parties<br/>will make good faith effort to consolidate grievances involving two or<br/>more teachers, but the District reserves the right to separate group<br/>grievances.</p>

<p>SALARY SCHEDULE PROVISIONS<br/>CLASS A - BA (Intern, Emergency, Other)</p>
<p>CLASS B-BA+30 or MA<br/>CLASS C - BA+45 or MA+15<br/>CLASS D - BA+60 or MA+30<br/>CLASS E - BA+75 or MA+45<br/>CLASS F - BA+90 or MA+60</p>
<p>RULES GOVERNING PLACEMENT. ADVANCEMENT AND GROWTH CREDIT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement on the salary schedule shall be on the basis of professional preparation<br/>and experience gained under credentialed service.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective with the 1996-1997 school year, teachers coming in to the distr ict will<br/>be credited year for year for their experience in other public school districts.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full year’s experience is defined as seventy-five percent (75%) or more days<br/>taught in any school year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of intent to qualify for a higher class or longevity stipend must be filed<br/>with the Superintendent prior to June 1. Units shall be submitted to the<br/>Superintendent for review and recommendations. The District reserves the right to<br/>require prior approval of units.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All work accepted for movement to a higher class or longevity stipend must be<br/>completed along with transcripts and verification by October 25; however the<br/>District must receive, by August 1, unofficial verification of<br/>enrollment/participation in a class/program with a stated end date to receive salary<br/>schedule credit for that school year. This is due to the new STRS Penalty for Late<br/>Reporting of Earnings. Except for pass-fail courses, units shall not be eligible for<br/>salary credit unless earned with a grade of “C” or higher. In accordance with these<br/>provisions, the teacher will be placed in a higher class for the following year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a salary increase is granted and is reflected on the August 31 paycheck<br/>based on #5 above, and the class/program is not completed satisfactorily (and<br/>therefore, credit is not earned), the dollar amount of the increase will be deducted<br/>from the paychecks remaining in that fiscal year.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only credit earned after the bachelor’s degree has been awarded will be<br/>considered in advancing to a higher classification.</p>
