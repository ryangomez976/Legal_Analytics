Therefore,<br/>effective November 1, 2010, maintenance drug prescriptions that have been filled<br/>for 120 days must be filled through the available 90-day mail order process or the<br/>employee will be required to pay the full cost of the prescription. Also,<br/>physicians determining that a brand-name drug is required, must make that<br/>notification on the prescription form.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties agree to review the working definition of domestic partner. We use<br/>the language from the California Secretary of State for domestic partners. Same<br/>sex couples who have a Domestic Partnership registered with the State of<br/>California qualify for all of our medical plans. In the case of opposite sex<br/>couples, one person must be 62 years of age or older to qualify.</p>

<p>ADULT EDUCATION</p>
<p>A. Contract Coverage of Adult Education Teachers</p>
<p>Adult Education employees who are members of the unit shall be covered by all of the<br/>Articles of this Agreement, including this Adult Education Article, but excluding the<br/>following Articles:</p>
<p>Article IV<br/>Article VII<br/>Article XII<br/>Article XVI</p>
<p>Wages (except Section J)</p>
<p>Transfers</p>
<p>Class Size</p>
<p>Hours</p>
<p>When language in this Article (Article VI) is different from language in another Article,<br/>this Article has precedent.</p>
<p>An individual who is a member of the unit, whose workload is reduced below twenty<br/>(20) hours, due to reduction in hours of assignment, would continue to be a member of<br/>the unit for the remainder of the school year for purposes of membership and rights other<br/>than those excluded in this item.</p>
<p>B. Work Year</p>
<p>The number of days in the unit member’s work year for adult education certificated<br/>hourly employees is specified in each unit member’s annual assignment letter.</p>
<p>The work year for adult education certificated hourly employees is defined by the<br/>following categories of adult education teaching positions and full-time equivalent hours.</p>
<p>STRS Adult Education Teaching FTE Classifications Full-Time Equivalent</p>
<p>Automotive Tech., Adults with Disabilities Programs</p>
<p>Medical/Dcntal Training Programs</p>

<p>C.</p>
<p>Permanency</p>
<p>Adult Education employees who are members of the unit gain permanency through the<br/>Adult Education program:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult Education programs in all categories will vary in the number of hours<br/>required for permanency. This is due to the fact that teachers achieve<br/>permanency based upon their classification and defined work year. A unit<br/>member must teach more than sixty (60) percent of the hours in the FTE<br/>category in which the unit member is assigned to teach, and must work seventy-<br/>five (75) percent of the FTE category’s annual hours during a fiscal year in order<br/>to gain credit for one (1) year of sendee credit.(Ed Code 44908 &amp; 44929.25).<br/>Each year, the FTE category in which a unit member’s hours are recorded, would<br/>be in the category in which the teacher works the most hours during the fiscal<br/>year. Absences for any reason do not count toward completing the seventy-five<br/>(75) percent requirement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. A unit member who has been employed by the adult school in a position or</p>
<p>positions requiring certification for two complete consecutive school years as<br/>defined in (1) above and is then rehired for the next succeeding school year and<br/>shall become a permanent employee in the adult education program at the<br/>beginning of the third year for the average number of hours worked.</p>

<p>A permanent unit member may request up to fifty (50) additional days of paid sick leave, in<br/>any twelve month period, as a result of a catastrophic illness or injury. A unit member may<br/>only request these additional days, under this provision, once every five years.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, a unit member must submit a request for the additional days to<br/>Certificated Personnel Services at least fifteen working days before they expect to exhaust<br/>all available sick leave. The unit member is required to submit a physician’s verification to<br/>the Personnel office which clearly states the unit member is incapable of meeting the<br/>responsibilities of his/her normal work assignment due to devastating personal health <sup>27</sup></p>
<p>27</p>
<p>circumstances. The Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services shall determine if the.<br/>illness or injury meets the appropriate criteria and shall then inform the SEA President that<br/>an employee has requested catastrophic leave. The Assistant Superintendent, Personnel (W'<br/>Services shall arrange for a meeting of the Catastrophic Review Committee which will \<br/>evaluate the request and make a recommendation to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>The SEA shall contact unit members and request that they donate up to five of their personal<br/>sick leave days for use by the unit member requesting the catastrophic leave. The SEA will<br/>then submit the signed forms of unit members donating days to the Certificated Personnel<br/>Services Office.</p>
<p>The Catastrophic Review Committee shall consist of two (2) representatives appointed by<br/>the SEA President and two (2) members appointed by the Superintendent or designee. Unit<br/>Members with fewer than ten (10) days of accumulated sick days may not contribute sick<br/>days. All donated sick days must be for full days and thereafter are irrevocable.</p>
<p>A “catastrophic illness’<sup>5</sup> or “injury” means an illness or injury that is expected to render the<br/>unit member incapable of meeting the responsibilities of his/her normal work assignment<br/>for an extended period of time, which must be at least thirty (30) days.</p>
<p>The intent of this particular leave is to provide unit members economic relief for devastating<br/>personal health circumstances. Catastrophic leave may not be used for:</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member on a child rearing leave may not attend school full time or be<br/>gainfully employed outside the School District full time during the hours that the<br/>unit member would have been working for the District. Such a leave shall not<br/>deprive a unit member of the opportunity to substitute in the School District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the leave, including the date on which the leave should commence and<br/>the date on which the unit member shall resume duties, will be arranged through<br/>.coordination of the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services and the unit<br/>member, to coincide, if feasible, with the beginning of a semester. <sup>28</sup></p>
<p>28</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the expiration of the leave of absence, for twelve (12) calendar months or less,<br/>the unit member will normally return to the school attended immediately prior to the<br/>leave in accordance with the unit member’s seniority rights and transfer policy<br/>provisions. For leaves exceeding twelve (12) months, the unit member will be<br/>guaranteed a position for which they are credentialed or legally authorized, however<br/>it may not be the same assignment or work site.</p>

<p>The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and the California Family Rights Act<br/>(CFRA) provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to eligible unit members for<br/>certain family and medical reasons. Unit Members are eligible if they have worked for Simi<br/>Valley Unified School District for at least one year, or for 1,250 hours over the previous 12<br/>months (except full-time teachers).

<p>During Family Care Leave, the unit member must use all accrued vacation leave,<br/>other accrued time off, and any other paid or unpaid time off negotiated with the<br/>District. Accrued sick leave shall be used when the purpose of the leave is one for<br/>which sick leave can be taken pursuant to bargaining unit agreements and/or Board<br/>policy.

<p>If additional leave is needed when time estimated expires, the unit member must<br/>provide re-certification to include the above items.</p>
<p>4. Intermittent / Reduced Work Schedule Leave</p>
<p>Family Care Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule when<br/>medically necessary and in such a case, the unit member may be required:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the leave for periods of a particular duration, not to exceed the<br/>duration of the planned medical treatment.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To transfer temporarily to a different job with equivalent pay and benefits<br/>that can better accommodate recurring periods of leave.</p>

<p>Paid Benefits</p>
<p>During Family Care Leave, the unit member shall continue to be entitled to<br/>participate in the District’s medical, dental and vision plans with the same District<br/>contribution that was in effect prior to the leave. Upon expiration of the Family<br/>Care Leave entitlement, if additional unpaid leave is authorized, continuation of<br/>health care benefits coverage shall be allowed with the unit member paying all costs<br/>of coverage or as may be allowed in other applicable policies.</p>
<p>Recovery of Benefits</p>
<p>The District will recover health premiums paid if the unit member fails to return<br/>from Family Care Leave after the leave period has expired, provided this is for a<br/>reason other than the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition<br/>that entities the unit member to family care and medical leave, or other<br/>circumstances beyond the unit member’s control.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance of Status:</p>
<p>The unit member shall retain his or her employee status with the District during the<br/>leave period. The leave shall not constitute a break in service for purposes of<br/>longevity or seniority. For purposes of layoff, recall, promotion, job assignment and<br/>seniority related benefits such as vacation, the unit member returning from Family<br/>Care Leave shall return with no less seniority than he or she had when leave started.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reinstatement:</p>
<p>If the Family Care Leave was due to the unit member's own serious health condition,<br/>prior to returning to work the unit member shall provide a certification from the<br/>health care provider that he/she is able to resume the essential duties of the position.</p>
<p>The District will reinstate the unit member in the same or a comparable position<br/>when Family Care Leave ends. At the expiration of the leave of absence, for twelve</p>
<p>(12) calendar months or less, the unit member will normally return to the school<br/>attended immediately prior to the leave in accordance with seniority rights. For<br/>leaves exceeding twelve (12) months, the unit member will be guaranteed a position<br/>for which they are credentialed or legally authorized, however it may not be the<br/>same assignment or work site.</p>
<p>A unit member who takes leave has no greater right to reinstatement than if he or she<br/>had been continuously employed. If the District reduces its work force during the<br/>leave period and the unit member is laid off for legitimate reasons at that time, he or<br/>she is not entitled to reinstatement.</p>
<p>The District shall not refuse to hire and shall not discharge, fine, suspend, expel or<br/>discriminate against any unit member because he or she exercises the right to Family <sup>34</sup></p>
<p>34</p>
<p>Care Leave or because he or she gives information or testimony related to his or her<br/>or another person's Family Care Leave in an inquiry related to family leave rights.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funeral Attendance</p>
<p>Leave to attend the funeral of a close friend or a relative, not a member of the immediate<br/>family, must be approved in advance by the unit member's immediate supervisor. If the<br/>immediate supervisor denies such leave, the unit member may appeal the denial to the<br/>Superintendent and/or his/her designee. Time for the attendance is up to two (2) full days.<br/>This leave is independent of sick leave.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident and Illness</p>
<p>In accordance with Education Code Section 44984, industrial accident and illness leave<br/>shall be in effect for all unit members of the District according to the following provisions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall be for not more than sixty (60) days during which the schools<br/>of the District are required to be in session or when the unit member would<br/>otherwise have been performing work for the District in any one fiscal year for the<br/>same accident.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave shall not be accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall commence on the first day of absence.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person employed in a position requiring certification qualifications is absent<br/>from his/her duties on account of an industrial accident or illness, he/she shall be<br/>paid such portion of the salary due him/her for any month in which the absence<br/>occurs as, when added to his/her temporary disability indemnity under Division 4 or<br/>Division 4.5 of the Labor Code, will result in a payment to him/her of not more than<br/>his/her full salary.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial accident or illness leave shall be reduced by one (1) day for each day of<br/>authorized absence regardless of a temporary disability indemnity award.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the<br/>unit member shall be entitled to only the amount of unused sick leave due him/her<br/>for the same illness or injury.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the industrial accident or illness leave, the unit member shall be<br/>entitled to the benefits provided in Education Code Sections 44977, 44978 and<br/>44983, and for the purposes of each of these sections, the unit member's absence<br/>shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the industrial<br/>accident or illness leave, provided that if the unit member continues to receive<br/>temporary disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take as much of his/her<br/>accumulated sick leave which, when added to his/her temporary disability<br/>indemnity, will result in a payment to him/her of not more than his/her full salary. <sup>35</sup></p>
<p>35</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the unit member may endorse to the District the<br/>temporary disability indemnity checks received on account of his/her industrial<br/>accident or illness. The District, in turn, shall issue the unit member's appropriate (l<br/>salary warrants for payment of the unit member's salary and shall deduct normal v<br/>retirement and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member receiving benefits as a result of this section shall, during periods<br/>of injury or illness, remain within the State of California, unless the Governing<br/>Board authorizes travel outside the state.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to secure proof of industrial injury or illness of a unit<br/>member. Before salary payments will be made to a unit member absent because of<br/>industrial injury or illness, a report of such an accident or illness, in the form<br/>required by the State Compensation Insurance Fund, must be on file in the Office of<br/>the Assistant Superintendent, Certificated Personnel.</p>
<p>H. Legal Commitments, Transactions, and Jury Duty</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member receiving a summons to appear in court as a witness will notify<br/>his/her principal or immediate supervisor. Appropriate arrangements will be made<br/>for covering his/her assignment during his/her absence.</p>
<p>A unit member entitled to leave without loss of salary will refund any pay, other<br/>than expense allowances, received for such appearances to the Payroll Department<br/>upon receipt. The unit member's regular earnings will remain the same as though<br/>he/she had not been absent from work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(</p>
<p>A unit member who is granted a leave without salary in order to appear as a litigant<br/>or a witness not under official order may elect to use sick leave for salary<br/>replacement providing he/she can demonstrate that his/her request meets the<br/>requirements of personal necessity leave. Two (2) days of advance notice must be<br/>given to the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty</p>
<p>The District agrees to grant to unit members called for jury duty the standard<br/>required by law which is paid leave of absence for one day or one trial. Unit<br/>members summoned to jury duty shall submit a written notice along with a copy of<br/>the summons to the District at least ten days prior to the summons date. The District<br/>shall pay the unit member the salary and the unit member is to remit to the District<br/>the amount received for jury duty, less the amount awarded by the Court for mileage<br/>and expenses. Unit members shall report to work during any day or portion thereof<br/>in which jury duty services are not required.</p>
<p>A unit member who receives notice to appear for jury duty during the school year<br/>may voluntarily postpone juiy duty to non-work year days (i.e. during summer,<br/>winter break and spring break) and shall be compensated at the current daily<br/>substitute rate for each non-work year day of actual jury duty served. The procedure {[<br/>for such postponement and compensation is as follows: <sup>36</sup></p>
<p>36</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attach a copy of the original jury duty notice, written statement concerning<br/>postponement, and signed official court validation for each day of jury duty<br/>served.

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward these documents to the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel<br/>Services.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this article, unit members contracted to teach summer school<br/>are not eligible for jury duty compensation.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require further verification of any/all of the above<br/>mentioned documentation.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maternity Leave</p>
<p>Maternity leave of absence shall be granted to any unit member who is required to be absent</p>
<p>from duty because of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery thereffom under the</p>
<p>following conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The length of the maternity leave, including the date on which the leave should<br/>commence and the date on which the unit member shall resume duties, shall be<br/>determined by the unit member and the physician, to coincide if feasible, with the<br/>beginning of a term or other appropriate break.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is entitled to use accumulated sick leave when physically disabled<br/>or otherwise incapacitated from performing duties because of pregnancy,<br/>miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery thereffom. Use of sick leave benefits, under<br/>these circumstances, is restricted to cases of disability or related incapacity and must<br/>be verified by medical certification.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That period of leave when the unit member is not physically disabled or otherwise<br/>incapacitated from performing duties shall be without compensation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificate of good health from the attending physician shall be submitted prior to<br/>reinstatement for maternity reasons.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the expiration of the leave of absence, for twelve (12) calendar months or less,<br/>the unit member will normally return to the school attended immediately prior to the<br/>leave in accordance with rights and transfer policy provisions. For leaves exceeding<br/>twelve (12) months, the unit member will be guaranteed a position for which they<br/>are credentialed or legally authorized, however it may not be the same assignment<br/>or work site.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military Leave</p>
<p>1. Applicants for military leave shall make every effort to prevent their military<br/>obligations from conflicting with school duties.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such absence shall not affect in any way the classification of such unit member with<br/>regard to District seniority. However, in the case of a probationary unit member, the<br/>period of absence shall not count as part of the service required as a condition fV<br/>precedent to the classification of such unit member as a permanent unit member of \<br/>the District.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within six (6) months after such unit member honorably leaves such service or has<br/>been placed on inactive duty, he/she will normally return to the school attended<br/>immediately prior to his/her leave in accordance with his/her seniority rights.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation shall be paid as provided by Administrative Regulation 4161.5<br/>Military Leave.</p>
<p>K. Personal Illness</p>
<p>Each full-time unit member is entitled to one (1) day of sick leave per calendar month of the<br/>contract period. A unit member who is employed less than full time is entitled to a<br/>proportionate amount of sick leave, in accordance with his/her contract.</p>
<p>Unit members may accumulate unused sick leave without limitation.</p>
<p>Certification of transferable sick leave by new District unit members coming from other<br/>California districts shall be made in accordance with Education Code Section 44979.</p>
<p>During each year of contracted service, when a unit member is absent on account of<br/>personal illness, he/she shall be allowed full salary for that period of time equal to the \<br/>balance of his/her accumulated sick leave. Compensation for continued absence beyond the<br/>expiration of accumulated sick leave within the school year shall be fifty percent (50%) of<br/>the regular salary, irrespective of substitute replacement for a period of time not to exceed<br/>five calendar months or return to duty, whichever occurs first. Written certification from a<br/>physician or health advisor must be sent to the District at the beginning of the five month<br/>period at half pay, along with a Request for Leave form where the absence is expected to be<br/>of extended duration. Upon return to duty, a unit member must provide his/her supervisor<br/>with an affidavit from a licensed physician, chiropractor or church practitioner, certifying<br/>the unit member's fitness for duty.</p>
<p>A unit member is eligible for only one five-month period per illness or injury per year and if<br/>a five-month period is not completed by the end of the school year, the balance of days<br/>continue into the next school year. A new five-month period does not begin with the start of<br/>the next school year. After a unit member has exhausted the five months of leave and is<br/>unable to return to work, the unit member shall be placed on a re-employment list for<br/>twenty-four (24) months if probationary and thirty-nine (39) months if permanent.</p>
<p>If, during the re-employment period, a unit member is able to return to work, he/she shall be<br/>placed in the first available vacant position for which the unit member is credentialed and<br/>legally authorized to serve. (Ed. Code 44977) Should current law governing five-month<br/>leave provisions change, either party may reopen this section of the Leaves Article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, <sup>38</sup></p>
<p>38</p>
<p>Total salary received from sick leave benefits and/or worker's compensation benefits shall<br/>not exceed the regular salary of a unit member.</p>
<p>Absence due to illness and/or injury for twenty (20) or more days will be considered a<br/>health leave requiring a doctor's statement certifying the unit member's fitness for duty.</p>
<p>Normally, verification will not be required for short term illnesses. Verification may be<br/>required however, for absences five (5) days, situations where there is a doubt as to the<br/>employee's fitness to return to work, or where the site administrator (or other applicable<br/>administrator) has reason to believe that there may be an abuse of sick leave).</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Leave</p>
<p>After five (5) years service, excluding leaves, a unit member may apply for a leave of<br/>absence without pay. Employees shall make every reasonable effort to submit request for<br/>personal leave on or before March 1 of the school year immediately preceding the school<br/>year in which the leave will occur.</p>
<p>The request for leave shall be evaluated on the basis of the instructional requirements and<br/>best interests of the school system as determined by the Board of Education.</p>
<p>Personal leaves may be for a period of up to one (1) year, with the option of requesting<br/>renewal for one (1) additional year. Renewal requests shall be evaluated using the same<br/>criteria set forth above.</p>
<p>A unit member may elect to continue all District health and welfare benefits at his/her<br/>own expense, and to the extent permitted by the applicable health care provider, at the<br/>active employees premium rate.</p>
<p>Employees shall make every reasonable effort to notify the District on or before March 1<br/>of each year whether or not the employee is contemplating resigning/retiring; seeking a<br/>renewal of a leave; or will be returning from leave.</p>
<p>At the expiration of the leave of absence, the unit member will normally return to the<br/>school attended immediately prior to the leave in accordance with the unit member's<br/>seniority rights and transfer policy provisions.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>Unit members may elect to use up to seven (7) days of earned and accumulated sick leave<br/>annually. In claiming personal necessity, the member is certifying that such absence was<br/>used for reasons of compelling personal importance. Such use shall be at the discretion of<br/>the unit member. With just cause, the School District has the power and duty to review<br/>the determination of the unit member.</p>
<p>If, for the purpose of this section, “just cause” is read to mean that if there is an<br/>objectively demonstrable cause (that is, beyond a mere unsupported suspicion) to doubt<br/>that a compelling personal reason exists, the District has the “power and duty” to “review<br/>the determination” by requesting the reason for having taken the leave, and if it is <sup>39</sup></p>
<p>39</p>
<p>determined that no such reason or insufficient reason existed, the District may deny the<br/>pay for such leave time.</p>
<p>In the interest of establishing guidelines for utilization, the parties have further agreed<br/>that:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever such utilization of leave time under Section M is anticipated in advance,<br/>reasonable advance notification of intent to take the leave shall be given.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section M, Personal Necessity Leave, (absent for a compelling reason), should not<br/>be taken for certain reasons, among which would be:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacation</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recreational pursuits</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political Activities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strikes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrations, picketing and</p>
<p>lobbying)</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Events (except weddings, graduations and religious ceremonies of<br/>immediate family members)</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking or engaging in remunerative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employment/business</p>
<p>The parties further recognize that on relatively rare occasions the reason for the<br/>leave may be of such a highly personal and private nature that the unit member<br/>should not be expected to divulge the reason. In this event, the District shall<br/>accept the unit member's assertion of a compelling personal need, unless there is<br/>still cause for doubt. In that event, the matter will be referred to the Assistant<br/>Superintendent, Certificated Personnel, for determination in a private meeting<br/>between the unit member and the Assistant Superintendent of Certificated<br/>Personnel. Matters discussed in the meeting will not be recorded and will be kept<br/>in the strictest confidence.</p>
<p>N. Sabbatical Leaves</p>
<p>The provision of a paid Sabbatical Leave of Absence is suspended for the duration of this<br/>Contract of Agreement. <sup>40</sup></p>

<p>Article IX</p>
<p>%</p>
<p>RETIREMENT PROGRAM</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition</p>
<p>The retirement program is an incentive plan whereby a certificated unit member may retire<br/>and continue to have medical insurance premiums paid until age sixty-five (65) or until<br/>retiree is eligible for Medicare, whichever occurs first.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the Retirement Program the unit member must be fifty-five (55) as of<br/>September 1 of the year that retirement benefits begin.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefit</p>
<p>From the date of retirement, as outlined above, to age sixty-five (65), or until the retiree is<br/>eligible for Medicare, whichever occurs first, the District shall pay the single party rate of the<br/>least expensive Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) not to exceed two hundred dollars<br/>($200) per month towards “employee only” medical insurance premiums. If the premium of<br/>the plan selected by the retiree exceeds two hundred dollars ($200) per month, the retiree<br/>shall be responsible for paying the difference. The retiree may also at his/her option, and<br/>subject to the conditions set by the insurance provider, purchase additional insurance for<br/>his/her spouse/dependents at his/her own cost.</p>
<p>If enrolled in the District Self-Funded Indemnity' Plan, the employee must convert to a<br/>District Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) insurance plan during the “open<br/>enrollment” period in the year of retirement.</p>
<p>If the retiree purchases his/her own medical insurance or in the event of relocation to an area<br/>not serviced by the selected District Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), the District<br/>will pay the individual retiree’s retirement benefit as outlined above.</p>
<p>The retiree cannot use this premium of up to a maximum of two hundred dollars ($200) per<br/>month for the District Self-Funded Indemnity Plan.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements</p>
<p>To qualify for this incentive, a unit member must have been actively employed by the Simi<br/>Valley Unified School District for a minimum of ten (10) years. The unit member must<br/>submit application for retirement and resignation by March 9 of the current school year to be<br/>effective no later than June 30. The unit member must resign from regular employment with<br/>the District and be officially accepted into the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS)<br/>prior to receiving the benefit. Acceptance shall be defined as monthly receipt of retirement<br/>income. Verification to the District Office shall be the responsibility of the retiree.</p>
<p>Retirees may elect to postpone the Retirement Program benefit to a later date. This benefit<br/>applies only until the retiree reaches age sixty-five (65) or is eligible for Medicare, whichever<br/>occurs first.</p>
<p>This Retirement Program benefit may not be used if the retiree elects COBRA.</p>

Employees shall notify the site administrator of loss and/or<br/>damage within five (5) working days following discovery of the loss/damage to initiate the<br/>procedure for processing the claim.</p>

<p>Article XIII</p>
<p>GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance is a dispute between the District and an aggrieved person involving<br/>a violation, interpretation, or application of one or more provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An aggrieved person is a unit member, or group of unit members, or the<br/>Association (or its representative).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; shall be defined as any day with the exception of Saturdays, Sundays,<br/>legal and local holidays, and Winter and Spring recesses. Normally this shall<br/>include days during summer hiatus. However, at the option of the grievant and<br/>without penalty or prejudice, a grievance which has not been settled prior to the<br/>last day of the Spring semester may be deferred for a period of time not to exceed<br/>the end of the first week of the beginning of the regular Fall semester.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the filing of a written grievance at the lowest possible administrative<br/>level, equitable solutions to the problems which may from time to time arise with<br/>respect to this Agreement should be sought.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any unit<br/>member having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with the appropriate<br/>member of the administration, and to have the grievance adjusted without<br/>intervention by the Association, provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent<br/>with the terms of the Agreement and the Association has been given an<br/>opportunity to be present at such adjustment and to state its view.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time<br/>limit specified at each level shall be considered to be a maximum and every<br/>effort shall be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be<br/>extended by mutual agreement. Failure by administration to observe designated<br/>time limits without securing mutual agreement extending such limits shall result<br/>in a waiver of level consideration and immediate processing of the grievance to<br/>the next higher level. Failure by the aggrieved to adhere to submission deadlines<br/>shall mean that the aggrieved accepts the latest decision and waives any right to<br/>further appeal. <sup>51</sup></p>
<p>51</p>
<p>C. Procedure</p>
<p>Level I</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aggrieved shall first discuss the grievance with his/her immediate supervisor.<br/>The aggrieved has the right to have a representative of the Association present<br/>and participating at the discussion(s). In the event that the immediate supervisor<br/>acknowledges his/her lack of authority to provide the remedy requested, the<br/>grievance may be initiated at the lowest level where such authority exists. The<br/>District and the Association agree that every effort will be made by the District<br/>and the aggrieved party to settle grievances at the lowest possible level. In the<br/>event an informal conference is requested and identified by the unit member as<br/>an informal conference related to the grievance procedure, the fifteen (15) days<br/>shall begin the day after such conference takes place except that the conference<br/>shall be requested within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence giving rise to the<br/>alleged grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the grievant proceeds without Association representation, any<br/>proposed resolution shall be communicated to the Association and the<br/>Association shall have ten (10) days in which to file a response.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, the grievance must be filed in writing on the approved grievance<br/>form within fifteen (15) days after the aggrieved person knew or reasonably<br/>should have known about the occurrence giving rise to the grievance. The<br/>written grievance shall include: 1) a description of the specified grounds for the<br/>grievance; 2) a listing of the provisions of the Agreement which are alleged to<br/>have been violated; and 3) a statement of the action(s) requested of the District<br/>which will resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor or the person at the lowest level where such authority<br/>exists shall respond in writing within ten (10) days to the written grievance.</p>
<p>Level II</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If within ten (10) days following the receipt of the written response from the<br/>Level I administrator, the aggrieved is not satisfied with the disposition of the<br/>grievance at Level I, he/she may file the grievance in writing with the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) days after the receipt of the written grievance by the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, he/she shall meet with the aggrieved person<br/>and a representative of the Association (if requested by the aggrieved person) in<br/>an effort to resolve it. A proposed resolution shall be communicated to the<br/>Association immediately after the hearing whenever the grievant proceeds<br/>without Association representation, and the Association shall have ten (10) days<br/>in which to file a response. The written disposition by the Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee shall be rendered within ten (10) days after said meeting or after<br/>the Association's response. <sup>52</sup></p>
<p>52</p>
<p>Level III</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance<br/>at Level II, he/she may, within ten (10) days after a decision by the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, request in writing that the Association submit<br/>his/her grievance to arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures<br/>delineated in this Article, The Association, by written notice to the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the<br/>request from the aggrieved person, may submit the grievance to binding<br/>arbitration. If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such<br/>question shall be ruled upon by the arbitrator prior to hearing the merits of the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall select a mutually acceptable arbitrator. Should they be unable<br/>to agree oh an arbitrator within ten (10) days of the Association's submission of<br/>the grievance to arbitration, request for a panel of arbitrators from which to select<br/>shall be made to the California Conciliation Service. In any event, the parties<br/>shall then be bound by the rules and procedures of the California Conciliation<br/>Service in the selection of an arbitrator and the arbitrator shall proceed under the<br/>Voluntary Arbitration Rules of said service. By mutual agreement, the<br/>arbitration may be held under the Expedited Rules of the American Arbitration<br/>Association.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision and/or award(s) shall be in writing and set forth his/her<br/>findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted. The<br/>arbitrator shall be without power and authority to make any decision which<br/>requires the commission of an act prohibited by law or which is violative of the<br/>terms of this Agreement. However, it is agreed that the arbitrator's findings will<br/>be submitted to the Superintendent and the Association and will be considered<br/>final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but not limited to, per diem<br/>expenses, his/her travel and subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing<br/>room, shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other costs<br/>shall be borne by the party incurring them. Either party may request a court<br/>reporter to record the arbitration hearing, the costs to be paid by the requesting<br/>party. If the arbitrator requests a court reporter, the costs shall be borne equally<br/>by the District and the Association.</p>
<p>D. Rights of Employees to Representation</p>
<p>1. The grievant has the right to have a representative present at any or all steps of<br/>the grievance procedure. The grievant, however, must be present at each step of<br/>the procedure. If the grievant is unable to be present due to absence from duty<br/>caused by illness, injury or other emergency, the processing of the grievance<br/>shall be deferred until the unit member returns to duty. The time limits set forth<br/>in the Article shall also be extended by the number of days of absence of the<br/>grievant. <sup>53</sup></p>
<p>53</p>
<p>2. If a unit member is not represented by the Association or its representative, the<br/>Association shall be informed of the grievance and shall have the right to be<br/>present and to state its views through its representative(s) at all stages of the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>E. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, either on its own behalf or on . behalf of the affected unit<br/>member, may initiate a grievance which affects more than one unit member in<br/>a single building or unit members in more than one building at Level II.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of the grievance takes place, the aggrieved unit member<br/>is required to conform to the original direction of his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort will be made to schedule meetings for the processing of grievances<br/>at times which will not interfere with the regular work day of the participants.<br/>However, when it is necessary for a representative designated by the Association<br/>to investigate a grievance or attend a grievance meeting during the day, he/she<br/>shall, upon notice to his/her principal, or immediate superior, by the President of<br/>the Association, be released for a reasonable period of time without loss of pay<br/>or accumulated sick leave in order to permit participation in the foregoing<br/>activities. Any unit member who is required to appear in such investigations,<br/>meetings, or hearings as a witness shall be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits for appeal at each level shall begin the day following receipt of</p>
<p>written decision.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the District or the Association against<br/>any aggrieved person or other participant in the grievance procedure by reason<br/>of such participation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a<br/>grievance shall be filed in a separate grievance file and will not be kept in the<br/>personnel file of any of the participants. Access to the grievance file shall be<br/>limited to the grievant, . authorized Association representative(s), and District<br/>personnel charged with the processing of grievances on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of grievances, the serving of notices, the taking of appeals, the making<br/>of reports and recommendations, and other necessary documents shall be<br/>prepared on forms designed and agreed upon by the parties so as to facilitate<br/>operation of the procedure. The costs of preparing such forms shall be borne by<br/>the District.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of the<br/>administration at a level above the immediate supervisor, the aggrieved person<br/>shall first attempt to resolve this informally with the appropriate administrator.<br/>If not satisfied with this position of the grievance, he/she shall submit such<br/>grievance in writing to the Superintendent and the Association directly, and the<br/>process of such grievance will be commenced at Level II. <sup>54</sup></p>
<p>54</p>
<p>Article XIV</p>
<p>INTERMEDIATE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>The employment status of each unit member is conditional upon reasonable standards of.<br/>personal conduct and job performance. Failure to meet such standards may provide the basis<br/>for appropriate intermediate discipline.</p>
<p>The District retains the right to discipline unit members for just cause. If appropriate,<br/>progressive discipline shall be followed in cases of disciplinary action. The following steps<br/>shall ordinarily be utilized; however, the process may be initiated at any level if, in the<br/>opinion of the supervisor, such action is warranted:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of problem or unacceptable behavior and verbal reprimand, if<br/>appropriate.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written warning not placed in personnel file.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written reprimand in personnel file with notice of future possibility of appropriate<br/>intermediate discipline.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate intermediate discipline which may include, but is not necessarily<br/>limited to, suspension with pay or suspension without pay for a period as<br/>specified in the Education Code.</p>
<p>The following procedures shall apply when, in the judgment of the supervisor, an employee<br/>has committed an act or an omission that justifies intermediate discipline as provided in<br/>number 4 above.</p>
<p>A written recommendation for suspension, a copy of which will be forwarded to the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, will be given or sent by Registered Mail to the employee<br/>by the Personnel Office. The written statement shall contain a description of the events<br/>which necessitated the recommendation, a statement of the charges, notification that the<br/>employee may review or make copies of available materials leading to the suspension, and<br/>the right of the employee to meet with the supervisor and to submit, in writing, his/her<br/>response to the proposed action within five (5) days.</p>
<p>The suspension of an employee shall not be implemented for five (5) days pending the<br/>employee's written response.</p>
<p>If, within the five (5) day response period, the employee involved does not file a response,<br/>the action of the supervisor shall be implemented upon the approval of the Superintendent or<br/>his/her designee.</p>
<p>If, within the five (5) day response period, the employees choose to file a response, he/she<br/>shall do so by the option of filing a written response to the Superintendent, or by requesting a<br/>hearing at Level II of the grievance process. The hearing shall be conducted as expeditiously</p>

<p>as possible, but no later than ten (10) working days after receipt of the written response. The<br/>written response by the Superintendent or his/her designee shall be rendered within ten (10)<br/>days after the hearing, which shall either sustain, reject, or modify the suspension action<br/>against the employee.</p>
<p>If the employee is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her case at Level II, he/she may,<br/>within ten (10) days, request in writing that the case commence to binding arbitration, with<br/>or without the approval of the Association. The procedure for selection of an arbitrator shall<br/>follow numbers 2, 3 and 4 under Level IH of the grievance procedure, except that the<br/>employee shall assume responsibility for costs should there be no support by the Association.</p>
<p>Article XV</p>
<p>HOURS</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Work Day</p>
<p>It is recognized that the varying nature of a unit member's day to day responsibilities does<br/>not lend itself to a specific enumeration of duties or to a working day of rigidly<br/>established length. Unit members require a flexible period of time for fulfillment of<br/>professional obligations and adjunct duties. Activities considered part of a unit<br/>member’s professional day include Staff Meetings, Department Meetings/Grade Level<br/>Mcetings/Leadership Meetings, Parent Conferences and/or Parent Communications,<br/>Back to School Night and Open House, IEP and 504 meetings, Adjunct Duties as<br/>outlined in the Certificated Handbook that are not filled by volunteers. The above list is<br/>intended as examples of professional responsibilities and is not intended to be a complete<br/>list of those responsibilities. It is understood that these duties may be completed outside<br/>a unit member’s instructional day and that administrators are responsible for providing<br/>adequate notice for such meetings.</p>
<p>Co-curricular or extracurricular duties are voluntary, paid school service (as listed in<br/>Appendix C).</p>
<p>It is recognized that unit members need to be on duty a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes<br/>prior to the opening of school and to remain on duty until the school dismissal time,<br/>working on school-related activities and such appropriate time after the school dismissal<br/>time to fulfill the duties and responsibilities described above.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Education Preschool</p>
<p>The preschool teaching responsibility will be a minimum of 1225 instructional minutes<br/>per week with 1000 minutes per week allocated to the preschool session inclusive of<br/>recess and exclusive of lunch. Additional time with students (extended day, staggered<br/>program, assisting with other classrooms, or home visits) of a minimum of 225 minutes a<br/>week will be scheduled in consultation with the program administrator and the teacher in<br/>accordance with specific guidelines agreed upon by the District and SEA.</p>
<p>When due to enrollment growth during the school year it becomes necessary to add an<br/>afternoon program and no qualified candidate can be found to fill the position, a<br/>preschool unit member may be required to teach a double session. The assignment will<br/>be made in the following order:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative assignment</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a unit member has taught a double session, either voluntary or mandated,<br/>the unit member will be placed at the bottom of the selection list, <sup>57</sup></p>
<p>57</p>
<p>Any unit member assigned to teach two instructional sessions will be compensated at one-<br/>sixth of his/her per diem for each hour or part of an hour of service beyond the 1225 required<br/>instructional minutes per week. This compensation shall be considered extra compensation<br/>and not part of the unit member’s base salary for STRS reporting purposes. There shall be<br/>no additional compensation for time spent in preparation for this extra period of teaching.<br/>However, during the double session assignment the 225 minutes per week beyond the 1000<br/>instructional minutes per week will be reserved for unit member planning and preparation.<br/>The length of each assignment will be for one semester.</p>
<p>Elementary</p>
<p>The first through sixth grade school day shall consist of three hundred ten (310) instructional<br/>minutes.</p>
<p>The kindergarten teaching responsibility will be a minimum of 255 instructional minutes per<br/>day with at least 200 minutes allocated to the Kindergarten session inclusive of recess and<br/>exclusive of lunch.</p>
<p>There shall be ten (10) minimum days at the elementary level. The minimum day at the<br/>elementary level (Grades 1-6) shall be 235 minutes. Individual schools may determine how<br/>the ten (10) days may be utilized (for the purpose of back-to-school night, open house, fall<br/>and spring conferencing, structured collaboration or professional development and other uses<br/>as approved using the contractual site based decision making process. Unit members<br/>teaching classes in grades four (4) through six (6) shall be given one day of release time to<br/>accommodate the larger number of mandatory conferences required to be conducted in the<br/>fall. Also, on an as needed basis, these same teachers will be eligible for up to one additional<br/>day of release time as outlined above for spring conferencing, depending on the number of<br/>conferences held.</p>
<p>Secondary</p>
<p>Middle School</p>
<p>The middle school day shall consist of 365 instructional minutes (including no more than<br/>forty [40] minutes for passing periods). This includes six (6) class periods, one of which is a<br/>preparation period. No more than thirty (30) minutes of the six (6) class periods shall be<br/>used for ancillary purposes as determined by the majority of the certificated staff.</p>
<p>There shall be five (5) minimum days at the middle school level. The minimum day at the<br/>middle school shall be 240 minutes. Individual schools may determine how the five (5) days<br/>may be utilized (for the purpose of back-to-school night, open house, testing, conferencing<br/>and staff development) with the approval of the majority of the certificated staff and the<br/>superintendent or designee. Additional minimum days may be requested.</p>
<p>HiehSchool</p>
<p>The comprehensive high school day shall consist of a minimum of 365 instructional minutes<br/>(including no more than forty [40] minutes for passing periods). This includes six (6) class<br/>periods, one of which is a preparation period. No more than thirty (30) minutes of the six (6)<br/>class periods shall be used for ancillary purposes as determined by the majority of the<br/>certificated staff.</p>
<p>There shall be six (6) minimum days at the senior high school level. The minimum day at<br/>the senior high school shall be a minimum of 240 minutes. Individual schools may<br/>determine how the six (6) days may be utilized (for the purpose of back-to-school night,<br/>open house, final exams, testing, conferences and staff development) with the approval of the<br/>majority of the certificated staff and the superintendent or designee. Additional minimum<br/>days may be requested.</p>
<p>The alternative high school shall consist of a minimum of 180 minutes and a maximum of<br/>255 minutes.</p>
<p>Elementary Class Coverage</p>
<p>It is agreed that no elementary teacher will be assigned students from other classrooms when<br/>the District would normally assign a substitute to cover a teacher absence. In the event of an<br/>unforeseen emergency with district-wide implications or an unforeseen catastrophe wherein<br/>the School District would establish emergency coverage procedures, the District would<br/>reimburse the excess coverage through means of a fund for supplies, equipment or other<br/>educational use.</p>
<p>Elementary Preparation Period</p>
<p>The preparation period is intended to enhance the accomplishment of duties and<br/>responsibilities of the unit member by providing a block of time on campus during the school<br/>day for school-related matters.</p>
<p>If a District program is in place providing elementary preparation time that will be the only<br/>accepted program. The current plan to provide elementary preparation for the grades 4-6 is<br/>Elementary Science Program</p>
<p>Unit members who are involuntarily assigned to utilize their preparation period for either<br/>emergency and/or non-emergency purposes shall be compensated from the first day at the<br/>established hourly rate.</p>
<p>Preparation Period - Secondary Level</p>
<p>The preparation period is intended to enhance the accomplishment of duties and<br/>responsibilities of the unit member by providing a block of time on campus during the school<br/>day for school-related matters. While the preparation period is normally utilized on campus,<br/>it is recognized that obligations may occur which necessitate being off campus during this<br/>time.</p>
<p>When such obligations arise, the unit member shall notify the principal's office of the<br/>absence. When such obligations are personal in nature, the unit member shall have the prior<br/>approval of the principal.</p>
<p>It is recognized that emergencies may arise from time to time for which a unit member on<br/>his/her preparation period may be required to substitute for another unit member. Such an<br/>emergency is defined as occurrences which cannot be planned ahead of time, or when after a<br/>good faith effort, the district office is unable to secure a substitute. The declaration and<br/>administration of such an emergency is the responsibility of the principal.</p>
<p>In such an emergency, every effort will be made to secure volunteers for substitution. If<br/>necessary, unit members will be assigned in a fair and equitable manner. Use of the<br/>preparation period may be directed from time to time by the principal for non-emergency<br/>situations, such as extra curricular coverage.</p>
<p>Unit members who are involuntarily assigned to utilize their preparation period for either<br/>emergency and/or non-emergency purposes shall be compensated from the first day at the<br/>established hourly rate for an additional assignment as stipulated in the Contract.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Calendar</p>
<p>The calendar for the school years 2010 - 2013 will include 185 days of service for returning<br/>unit members and 185 Vi days of service for newly employed unit members. (See Appendix<br/>D).</p>
<p>The Simi Educators Association will be able to have a meeting on the day scheduled for new<br/>and returning teacher orientation.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule Modifications</p>
<p>Schools wanting to alter their schedules as defined in this article must follow existing<br/>guidelines in the Certificated Employee Handbook and submit site specific plans to SEA and<br/>the District. Plans developed outside of specified guidelines must be submitted to SEA and<br/>the District for approval.</p>
<p>Schools who submit a plan for a modified schedule must first secure the approval of no less<br/>than sixty percent (60%) of the certificated staff. For the purposes of this section<br/>“certificated staff’ shall be defined to include librarians, nurses, bargaining unit members,<br/>long-term substitutes in position for six (6) months, job sharers (get one full vote), literacy<br/>•coaches (teachers), resource teachers (one vote at home site) and site administration that are<br/>expected to regularly attend staff meetings. This list excludes itinerant science teachers,<br/>teachers on special assignment located at the District Office, school psychologists, and long<br/>term substitutes in position less than six (6) months. All eligible staff shall receive ballots.<br/>A vote of 60% of the ballots cast are needed to effect a change. All modified plans shall be<br/>in place for the ensuing school year. <sup>60</sup></p>
<p>60</p>
<p>A modified schedule, once implemented at a school site, becomes the official schedule for<br/>that site. As such, it will remain in place unless changed through the schedule modification<br/>process described above.</p>
<p>A schedule modification is the adjustment of required daily instructional time that alters the<br/>starting and ending time of the school day and requires Board of Education approval.<br/>Purposes for modified instructional schedules include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff Meetings</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade Level/Department articulation</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership/Department Chair Meetings</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-site Committee Meetings</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructional Preparation and Planning</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STAR Test Prep Meeting</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary parent conferencing</p>
<p>A timeline for a schedule modification will involve the development, discussion, approval<br/>and finalization phases as follows:</p>
<p>Development (August/September/October) - In order for the staff to consider a<br/>schedule modification, the SEA Rep(s) will ensure that at least 20% of the staff<br/>supports bringing the issue forward.</p>
<p>Discussion (October/November/December) - Prior to winter break, the staff will<br/>explore and develop options for schedule modifications.</p>
<p>Approval (January/February/March) - The purpose/plan along with options and<br/>associated calendar must be submitted to District and SEA for approval. After review<br/>and authorization, the use of a modified schedule, intended purpose, and staff<br/>activities must be approved by a vote of no less than sixty percent (60%) of the<br/>certificated staff assigned to the site.</p>
<p>Voting Process - All eligible staff shall receive ballots and be allowed two days to<br/>return the ballot to an agreed upon location. The ballots will be counted in the<br/>presence of the Principal, the SEA Representative and other interested parties. A<br/>vote of at least 60% of the ballots cast is needed to effect a change; if the vote is less<br/>than 60%, the default is the existing schedule.</p>
<p>Finalization (April/May) - The final vote for the selected option and calendar must be<br/>completed and submitted in time for Board of Education approval at the regularly<br/>scheduled meeting in April.</p>
<p>Notification of approval will be distributed to the school community by May 15<sup>lh</sup>.<br/>This will include but not be limited to school staff, parents, District staff and SEA<br/>office.</p>
<p>A modified schedule, once implemented at a school site, becomes the official<br/>schedule for that site and will remain in place unless changed through the schedule</p>
<p>modification process described above. The staff will review their traditional or<br/>*'■ modified calendar each year to identify the dates for staff meetings, grade<br/>level/department meetings, leadership/department chair meetings, on site committee<br/>meetings, instructional preparation and planning, STAR testing preparation meetings,<br/>etc.</p>
<p>For schedule modifications that do not require changing the start or ending time of<br/>school, a required vote of at least 60% of the staff is still necessary but the<br/>modification does not have to be sent to the District and SEA for review. For<br/>example, the use of 30 minutes of ancillary time at the secondary schools does not<br/>affect the start and ending time of the school day, but requires at least a 60% vote of<br/>the staff to effect a change.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this section &quot;certificated staff' shall be defined to include<br/>librarians, nurses, bargaining unit members, long-term substitutes in position for six</p>
<p>(6) months, job sharers (get one full vote), literacy coaches (teachers), resource<br/>teachers (one vote at home site) and site administration that are expected to regularly<br/>attend staff meetings. This list it excludes itinerant science teachers, teachers on<br/>special assignment located at the District Office, school psychologists, and long term<br/>substitutes in position less than six (6) months.</p>
<p>J. Job Share</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition: Job Sharing shall refer to two (2) full-time permanent teachers sharing<br/>one teaching assignment.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two teachers shall share an assignment for a minimum of one year. The job share<br/>shall be either a 50/50 or 60/40 split, unless prior approval is granted by the<br/>Superintendent or designee. It is understood that for the purposes of this section, a<br/>50/50 or 60/40 split refers to instructional days when students are present. Both<br/>members of a job share are expected to work the five (5) contracted pupil free work<br/>days.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only full-time permanent teachers shall be eligible to apply for job sharing.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for a job sharing assignment for the following school year shall be filed<br/>with the District no later than March 15.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests for job sharing shall be reviewed by the principal and the Superintendent<br/>or Designee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or Designee shall approve or deny the request. The decision of<br/>the Superintendent or Designee shall be final. The primary criteria for approving<br/>shared contracts shall be successfully meeting the educational needs of students.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the request for job sharing is denied, and if the affected employee(s) request, the<br/>reasons for the denial shall be provided.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared contract shall be considered a partial leave of absence for the portion of a<br/>full contract vacated to facilitate the shared agreement. Notwithstanding other<br/>provisions of the Teachers Contract, job sharing teachers’ wages, benefits, and paid<br/>leaves shall be prorated relative to the actual time worked. In no event shall the total<br/>amount of health and welfare benefits for the job sharers exceed the amount the<br/>District would have paid if the position had not been shared. Both teachers shall file<br/>a calendar of anticipated work days for the school year by June 30 of the previous<br/>school year.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job sharing teachers shall receive salary schedule increments on a prorated basis,<br/>provided however, that no movement on the schedule shall occur until the teacher has<br/>accrued at least one year’s worth of credit (e.g., has worked 50% for two years).</p>
<p>STRS credit shall be governed by applicable statutory provisions and is not affected<br/>by this provision.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All. partial leaves of absence shall be considered as one year positions with no<br/>automatic right to an extension. Upon request of the two teachers, a job-sharing<br/>assignment may be renewed provided the two teachers notify the Principal and<br/>District in writing prior to March 15. In the event the two teachers fail to notify the<br/>District in a timely basis of their desire to continue the job-sharing assignment or in<br/>the event the District does not approve the continuance of the assignment, the<br/>teachers shall be returned to full-time assignments. Both the Principal and the<br/>Superintendent or Designee shall have full discretion to decline to extend the leave.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher in a job-sharing assignment returns to full-time teaching following his/her<br/>first year of job sharing, the teacher shall be returned to his/her original school. If a<br/>teacher in a job-sharing assignment returns to full-time teaching following more than<br/>one year of job sharing, he/she will be assigned to his/her original school if a vacancy<br/>exists, otherwise the teacher will be assigned to the first available position for which<br/>he/she is credentialed or legally authorized.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one teacher is absent, the other teacher may assume the responsibility of covering<br/>the class. The teacher shall be paid the regular substitute salary for the days taught.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one partner to a shared contract is unable by reason of disability or other<br/>circumstance to continue under the shared contract agreement, the other partner is<br/>responsible to return to full time at their regular rate of pay. Should such return be<br/>blocked by personal circumstance, the partner shall be responsible for temporarily<br/>becoming full time while other arrangements are made.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities of the job sharing assignment shall be allocated according to a plan<br/>designed by the job sharers, with the concurrence of their immediate supervisor. The<br/>plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both job sharers being present for the first and last days of school.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both members of a job share are expected to work the five (5) contracted<br/>pupil free work days. <sup>63</sup></p>

<p>Article XVI</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble</p>
<p>The Association and the District agree that unit members’ knowledge, skills and practices develop<br/>throughout their professional careers. The nature of teaching requires continuous growth in order<br/>to engage and challenge increasingly diverse students in a rapidly changing world. Unit members<br/>are never “finished” as professional learners, no matter how extensive or excellent their formal<br/>education and preparation. If unit members<sup>5</sup> expertise, capabilities, and accomplishments are to be<br/>enriched over time, unit members must become reflective practitioners who actively seek to<br/>strengthen and augment their professional skills, knowledge, and perspectives throughout their<br/>careers. This program of professional accountability is designed to assist the unit member in<br/>professional development.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) Council will monitor and assess this professional<br/>accountability program annually.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Council will convene on a regular basis for the purpose of monitoring the<br/>effectiveness of the professional accountability program. The PAR Council, at its discretion,<br/>shall have the authority to make recommendations regarding modifications or refinements<br/>to the program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change to this program shall be made by mutual agreement of SEA and the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and SEA agree to adopt for the purposes of this program the California Standards<br/>for the Teaching Profession (CSTP). The CSTP provides a common language on teaching that will<br/>be used by unit members to prompt reflection about teaching and learning; develop professional<br/>goals; and guide, monitor and assess the progress of the unit member’s practice toward their<br/>professional goals. The CSTP will guide unit members as they define and develop their practice.<br/>The CSTP shall establish the guidelines for analyzing satisfactory performance of certificated<br/>employees.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards for regular classroom teachers shall be the six standards of teaching practice<br/>contained in the CSTP document.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional elements shall apply to Special Education Teachers in two standards.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards for Nurses and Librarians shall be established, defining satisfactory levels of<br/>performance, in the same format as the Standards for the Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrators and all certificated staff shall be responsible for maintaining and modeling<br/>Professional Standards at all times. As administrators observe in classrooms or work settings, they<br/>have the responsibility to identity any concerns related to the Professional Standards and to<br/>communicate those concerns to the unit member. <sup>65</sup></p>
<p>65</p>
<p>E.</p>
<p>Assessment Cycle</p>
<p>All unit members with non-permanent status shall be evaluated annually.</p>
<p>c</p>
<p>All unit members with permanent status who have been employed at least ten (10) years with the<br/>District, are highly qualified as defined in United States Code Title 20, Section 7801, Chapter 70,<br/>Subchapter IX, Part A (23), and whose previous evaluations have, for at least ten (10) years, been<br/>rated as meeting or exceeding standards, shall be evaluated every five years if the unit member and<br/>evaluator consent to this schedule. Should the evaluator withdraw consent, notice and identifiable<br/>cause shall be provided to the unit member in a timely manner.</p>
<p>All unit members with permanent status who do not meet the criteria above, shall be evaluated not<br/>less than every other year.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self Assessment</p>
<p>Each year, all unit members shall conduct a Self-Assessment. The Self-Assessment instrument shall<br/>be in the Continuum of Teaching Practice, which is a continuum of the standards and elements of<br/>the CSTP. Using the Continuum, each unit member shall establish goals and objectives focusing<br/>on his/her own performance for the year.</p>
<p>1. Unit members shall not be obligated to share their Self-Assessment with anyone.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall sign the Self Assessment completion form each year, stating they<br/>have completed the self assessment outlining their goals and objectives for the year. '</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of administrators to monitor and provide support to unit<br/>members with respect to their goals and objectives.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Accountability Options</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal, professional accountability program for unit members will consist of four (4)<br/>options. A list of timelines/deadlines, and materials detailing the professional accountability<br/>process shall be distributed to all unit members at the beginning of the school year. This<br/>professional accountability program has four goals:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Improve Instruction</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Maintain and Exceed Professional Standards</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Benefit Students and Teachers</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Promote Ongoing and Significant Professional Growth</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying intent of the program is that student outcomes will improve if student work<br/>is the focus of professional collegial interactions. The program has four options designed<br/>to allow unit members an opportunity to select a support system for their professional<br/>accountability. The options are:</p>
<p>a. Administrative-Mandated Option - This option is for probationary, temporary,<br/>i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interns,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or categorical (non-permanent) unit members and requires the unit member *</p>
<p>and an administrator to jointly develop goals generated from analysis of a self-</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>assessment of the Continuum of Teaching Practice. Probationary, temporary,<br/>interns, or categorical (non-permanent) employees will be evaluated annually on the<br/>Administrative Option for their first two years. The Administrator will complete<br/>a formative assessment each year. Administrators shall be responsible, by March 1,<br/>of the second year, for certifying that the employee has met the Professional<br/>Standards in each domain applicable to them. Employees unable to meet each of the<br/>.standards shall not be granted tenure.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation process shall be completed in sufficient time so that each<br/>teacher shall receive his/her evaluation no later than March 15.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall make a minimum of two formal observations of not less</p>
<p>than 40 minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary and temporary employees with less than two years of teaching<br/>experience shall be required to participate in the District’s Beginning Teacher<br/>Support and Assessment Program (BTSA).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative-Choice Option - This option is where a permanent unit member<br/>chooses to investigate student work, abilities, and behaviors in partnership with an<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portfolio Option - This option is based on an area of investigation where the unit<br/>member develops a portfolio with reflections to validate professional development.<br/>The portfolio for this option is not a “showcase” or “best work” portfolio. It is a<br/>learning/working portfolio.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partner Option - This option is a peer coaching model in which teachers collaborate<br/>and coach each other to determine success of professional development goals.</p>
<p>H. Assistance</p>
<p>Any tenured unit member identified as performing below the Professional Standards by the Site<br/>Administrator or designee shall be placed on an Assistance Program. The primary purpose of<br/>assistance is to improve the quality of classroom instruction and promote higher student<br/>achievement.</p>
<p>1. Placement on Assistance shall be done in two phases.</p>
<p>a. Phase I: Pre-Assistance</p>
<p>The duration of Pre-Assistance shall be ten (10) weeks. Before a teacher is placed<br/>on Pre-Assistance, the evaluator will use the following procedure to notify the<br/>teacher that there is/are problem(s) with the unit member’s performance. A written<br/>notice will be given to the unit member which includes the following information:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of the probl em, including the Professional Standard the program</p>
<p>addresses. <sup>67</sup></p>
<p>67</p>
<p>r-</p>
<p>ii.</p>
<p>iii.</p>
<p>iv.</p>
<p>v.</p>
<p>A statement of the desired behavior.</p>
<p>Date(s) the problem occurred.</p>
<p>Date by which the problem is to be resolved.</p>
<p>Recommendations and assistance that will be provided to the unit member.</p>
<p>After the written notification is given to the unit member, follow-up observations and<br/>conferences between the unit member and the evaluator will take place. The<br/>conferences will result in one of the following actions: 1) Problem resolved, return<br/>to current evaluation option; 2) Placement on Assistance; 3) Continue observations<br/>and conferences.

Both parties agree that optimum student performance can be<br/>achieved only if there is a fully qualified teacher in every classroom. In order for<br/>students to succeed in learning, teachers must succeed in teaching. The parties believe<br/>that all teachers, even the most skilled, must focus on continuous improvement in their<br/>professional practice. Therefore, the parties agree to cooperate in the design and<br/>implementation of a professional development program to improve the quality of<br/>instruction through expanded and improved staff development, peer assistance, and<br/>professional accountability.</p>
<p>Teachers recommended to the program are viewed as valuable professionals who are<br/>entitled to have resources available to them to enhance continuous performance<br/>improvement.</p>

The PAR Council<br/>will establish the operational procedures of the Council, including the method for<br/>the selection of a Chairperson.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Council will establish the meeting schedule. To hold meetings, four<br/>of the five members of the PAR Council must be present. Such meetings may<br/>take place during the regular workday, in which event teachers who are members<br/>of the Council will be released from their regular duties without loss of pay. If,<br/>in carrying out their responsibilities as members of the Council, teachers find it<br/>necessary to work beyond the regular workday, they will be compensated for such<br/>additional work in accordance with Article IV of the Agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Council shall be responsible for selecting Consulting Teachers (defined<br/>in Section D), evaluating Consulting Teachers and their documentation, and<br/>providing in-service training during the school year.

<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR Council is responsible for evaluating annually the impact of the PAR<br/>Program in order to improve the program.</p>
<p>C. Participating Teachers</p>
<p>1. A Participating Teacher is a unit member who receives assistance and coaching<br/>to improve instructional skills, classroom management, knowledge of subject,<br/>and related aspects of teaching performance. There are three (3) categories of<br/>P articipating T eacher s.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning Teacher (BT) Participants</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help new unit members successfully begin their careers<br/>in the District, all newly-hired unit members with less than two<br/>full years of fully credentialed teaching experience will be<br/>required to participate in the PAR program. All unit members<br/>who possess a Preliminary credential, Intern credential, or<br/>Emergency credential are required to participate in the PAR<br/>program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAR program for beginning unit members will be the<br/>Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) program.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All new unit members will be assigned a trained BTSA Support<br/>Provider (SP) or a Consulting Teacher from the PAR Program.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidelines for the BTSA Support Provider and Consulting<br/>Teacher will be developed and distributed by the PAR Council.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experienced Teacher Participants (ET)</p>
<p>-70-</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>The purpose of participation in the PAR program is to help<br/>correct job-related deficiencies and to assist the unit member in<br/>improving performance. Permanent unit members who exhibit<br/>serious job-related deficiencies, and have received a Needs<br/>ImprovementTating by the Principal on the Certificated Summary<br/>Evaluation Report in Parts I, II, IE, or IV, may be required to<br/>participate in the PAR program as an intervention. Unit members<br/>retain the right to grieve the evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Principal to refer a permanent unit member to<br/>the PAR program will not be subject to the grievance procedure<br/>presented in Article XIII of the Agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consulting Teacher will continue to provide assistance to the<br/>Participating Teacher until he or she concludes that the teaching<br/>performance of the Participating Teacher is satisfactory, or that<br/>further assistance will not be productive, at which time the<br/>Consulting Teacher will submit a final report to the PAR Council.<br/>The Participating Teacher shall have the right to submit a written<br/>response to the final report.

<p>Volunteer Teacher Participants (VT)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent unit member who seeks to improve his/her teaching<br/>performance may request the PAR Council to assign a Consulting<br/>Teacher to provide peer assistance. It is understood that the<br/>purpose of such participation is to provide peer assistance, and<br/>that the Consulting Teacher will play no role in the evaluation of<br/>the teaching performance of a V olunteer Teacher Participant. The<br/>VT may terminate his/her participation in the PAR program at<br/>any time without a requirement to give a reason for said request.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless requested by the VT, information obtained by the<br/>Consulting Teacher while working with the VT can not be<br/>utilized in the evaluation process and/or as the basis for<br/>mandatory^ participation in the PAR process.</p>

<p>SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING</p>
<p>The District and the Association recognize that empowering teachers through a process which<br/>allows employees at individual schools to have increased responsibility for making decisions will<br/>improve effective professional practice and the educational/leaming process. The parties<br/>acknowledge the importance of improving instructional programs through site-based decision<br/>making. When a school develops a site-based proposal that modifies the Contract, it must be<br/>submitted to the District and SEA for approval. A Memorandum of Understanding will be<br/>developed by the District and SEA in order to facilitate site-based objectives. The Board of<br/>Education will have final approval on all site-based proposals.</p>
<p>The District and SEA agree that the provisions of a Memorandum of Understanding shall not be<br/>interpreted or considered as establishing any precedent or practice, nor as a violation of any<br/>agreement, condition or practice.</p>
<p>The District and SEA agree that such Memorandum of Understanding may be initiated for a<br/>period of one or two years and that renewal, beyond the term, will require the submission of a<br/>new Memorandum of Understanding.</p>
<p>Decision-making at a school site should be shared by staff in a collegial manner, while<br/>recognizing that the decisions must conform to State and Federal laws, District policy, and the<br/>Contract unless site specific language has been approved. To be consistent with Board Policies<br/>and Guidelines, District and SEA will consult as needed using an interest-based decision making<br/>process.</p>
<p>Interest-Based Decision Making UBDMI</p>
<p>Interest-based decision making is a defined model for joint planning and problem-solving that<br/>seeks to improve the learning environment by allowing for organizational change and<br/>educational reform.</p>
<p>To initiate the EBDM process, contact the Assistant Superintendent of Personnel Services or<br/>SEA.</p>

<p>Memorandum</p>
<p>To:</p>
<p>From: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cary Dritz, Ed.D.</p>
<p>Asst. Superintendent, Personnel Seiwices<br/>Subject: Maternity Leave Information</p>
<p>Congratulations on the upcoming addition to your family! I hope you are all geared up for some sleepless<br/>nights and the incredible happiness that a new baby brings to a family. Our District wishes you and your<br/>family the best of health throughout this joyous time.</p>
<p>Taking time off from your regular assignment always creates many questions about leave, pay, health<br/>benefits and substitute coverage during your absence. We share your interest in providing your students<br/>with the best possible learning environment in your absence and we want you to be knowledgeable about<br/>the rights and benefits that are available to you at this time.</p>
<p>%</p>
<p>The following will provide you with information regarding your benefits and a timeline to help plan for the<br/>continuity of the school program. Please note that every situation is unique, so please make an<br/>appointment at least 30 days before your projected delivery date to discuss your plans and receive<br/>information and forms for the options that are best for you and your family.</p>
<p>Suggested timelines:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About six months before your due date, you should make an appointment or phone Personnel<br/>Services to discuss your tentative plans. You will need to know the estimated due date and your<br/>number of accumulated sick leave days. Please call Payroll for your number of available sick leave<br/>days. You should also have a general idea about whether you will be returning to work right away<br/>or if you plan to extend your leave beyond the customary six weeks after delivery.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this timeframe, you should talk to your principal about your tentative plans so that your<br/>principal and I can work with you to find a suitable substitute to cover your class in your absence.<br/>The substitute’s availability, credential and prior requests are all factors, so it is important that you<br/>speak to Personnel and your principal BEFORE you discuss any requests with any possible<br/>substitute.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave days are used for personal illness or to go to doctor’s appointments. You will probably<br/>be using some of your sick leave days as your due date approaches. Compensation for continued<br/>absence beyond the expiration of accumulated sick leave will be fifty percent (50%) of the regular<br/>salary. If you carry the supplemental Disability Insurance, please check with your carrier to see<br/>how your benefitted amount will coordinate with your illness leave.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>K</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you and your doctor determine that you are physically no longer able to work, we must have<br/>certification from him/her which shows the date of disability, time needed off work, and a medical<br/>notice that you are unable to work This will begin your Maternity Leave of Absence. The duration<br/>of the leave will be six weeks of leave (or eight weeks in the case of a Caesarian delivery) from the<br/>date your baby is born.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the six weeks (or eight weeks) of time has expired your choices are as follows:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may return to work.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you qualify and have requested in advance, you may go on Family Care Leave for up to twelve<br/>(12) weeks. (Family Care is an UNPAID leave, but the District will continue to provide your<br/>current benefit package for up to 12 weeks. You are still responsible for the designated<br/>monthly premium for your health care policy. Please make arrangements with Carla Dickson,<br/>Benefits Coordinator. NOTE: If you decide not to return to the District after this leave, you<br/>will need to reimburse the District for the amount of your benefit payments during your Family<br/>Care Leave.)</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request Child Care Leave. Child Care Leave is an UNPAID leave and your benefit<br/>package is not funded by the District. (You can choose to continue your benefits at your cost for<br/>the length of your leave.)</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are medically unable to return to work at the end of your six (6) or eight (8) week leave,<br/>you must obtain a note from your doctor stating so and you must complete paperwork for a<br/>Medical Leave of Absence. The doctor‘s note and Medical Leave of Absence form must be<br/>submitted to Certificated Personnel Services prior to the end of your six (6) or eight (8) week<br/>leave. Continued absence after the conclusion of the Maternity Leave that is not substantiated<br/>by a doctor's note and a Medical Leave of Absence request will be UNPAID.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at the end of your six (6) or eight (8) week leave you chose to take Family Care Leave, then about<br/>thirty (30) days before your Family Care Leave is over, you again have a decision to make:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may return to work.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may request Child Care Leave. Child Care Leave is an UNPAID leave and your benefit<br/>package is not funded by the District. (You can choose to continue your benefits at your cost for<br/>the length of your leave.)</p>
<p>If at any time, you have questions, please call me or schedule an appointment to discuss your situation.</p>
<p>I certify that I have reviewed and understand the above information.</p>
