<p>ARTICLE I<br/>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>1.01 Agreement</p>
<p>The Articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding agreement<br/>(&quot;Agreement&quot;) by and between the Superintendent of the Office of the County<br/>Superintendent of Schools of Sacramento County (&quot;Superintendent&quot;), and the Sacramento<br/>County Office of Education Teachers Association/CTA/NEA (&quot;SCOETA&quot;), an employee<br/>organization. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, §§ 3540 through<br/>3549 of the Government Code (&quot;Act&quot;).</p>
<p>The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement represent the full and complete<br/>understanding between the parties. No further negotiations shall take place on any item<br/>with any other individual or agency within or without the SCOETA bargaining unit.<br/>SCOETA and SCOE shall observe the right to consult on items not included in this<br/>Agreement or if State Legislation change any part of the Agreement.</p>
<p>ARTICLE II<br/>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>2.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Chapter 10.7 (commencing with § 3540) of the Government Code, SCOE<br/>recognizes SCOETA, as identified in Article I, as the exclusive representative of the<br/>certificated employees' unit.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the parties that representation of certificated personnel employed by<br/>SCOE shall rest with SCOETA.</p>
<p>2.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coverage</p>
<p>A. All regular and temporary certificated employees except management, confidential<br/>and supervisory. The following list of job descriptions will be updated as they are<br/>approved through the negotiation process:</p>
<p>Counselor, Alternative Education<br/>Deaf and Hard of Hearing Specialist<br/>ROP Instructor<br/>Nurse, Infant Development<br/>Nurse, Special Education<br/>School Nurse<br/>Program Specialist<br/>Program Specialist, School Readiness<br/>Program Specialist, Infant Program<br/>Resource Specialist</p>
<p>Resource Teacher<br/>School Social Worker<br/>Sly Park Outdoor Science Teacher<br/>Special Education Teacher for Court<br/>Schools<br/>Speech Therapist<br/>Teacher Alternative Education<br/>Teacher, ED</p>
<p>Teacher for the Homeless<br/>Teacher, Infant Development</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Teacher, Juvenile Institutions<br/>Teacher, Orient/Mobility<br/>Teacher, Outdoor Conservation &amp;</p>
<p>Teacher, SH</p>
<p>Teacher, Visually Handicapped<br/>Vision Specialist<br/>Vision Specialist, Infant Program<br/>Vocational Specialist, SH</p>
<p>Environmental Education<br/>Teacher, SCBC</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in D or E below, probationary certificated employee is defined as<br/>one who has been employed by SCOE for less than two (2) years.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification status is determined by California Education Code (EC) Sections (§§)<br/>44915-44920, 44910, 44911, and 44929.21. Generally, a probationary certificated<br/>employee is required to complete two (2) years of eligible service and return for the<br/>third year before becoming permanent.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set out in Article 2.02.C, ROP teachers’ classification rights are controlled by EC<br/>§44910 which disallows the achievement of seniority for the purposes of establishing<br/>permanent status. However, for the purposes of internal rights to transfer and<br/>displacement. Article XXV of this contract is intended to allow for seniority-based<br/>displacement among ROP teachers, provided that SCOE determines, based upon<br/>experience and credentialing, that the ROP teacher is qualified for the position. To<br/>the degree that Article XXV contradicts or appears to contradict the classification<br/>status set out above, it shall be construed in light of Articles 2.02.C and 2.02.D of this<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>3.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agency Shop</p>
<p>Any unit member who is a member of the SCOETA, or who has applied for membership,<br/>may sign and deliver to SCOE an assignment authorizing deduction of unified<br/>membership dues, initiation fees and general assessments in SCOETA. Pursuant to such<br/>authorization, SCOE shall deduct one-tenth (1/10) of such dues from the regular salary<br/>check of the unit member each month for ten (10) months. Deductions for unit members<br/>who sign such authorization after the commencement of the school year shall be<br/>appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the school year.</p>
<p>3.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dues</p>
<p>Any unit member who is not a member of the SCOETA, or who does not make<br/>application for membership prior to September 1, 1993, or within thirty (30) days from<br/>the date of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit, shall become a<br/>member of SCOETA or pay to SCOETA a fee in an amount equal to unified membership<br/>to SCOETA in one lump sum cash payment in the same manner as required for the<br/>payment of membership dues, provided, however, that the unit member may authorize<br/>payroll deduction for such fee in the same manner as provided in Article 3.01. In the</p>
<p>ARTICLE III</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY / DUES DEDUCTION</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>event that a unit member shall not pay such fee directly to SCOETA, or authorize<br/>payment through payroll deduction as provided in Article 3.01, SCOETA shall so inform<br/>SCOE, and SCOE shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction as provided in<br/>EC § 45061 and in the same manner as set forth in Article 3.01. There shall be no charge<br/>to SCOETA for such mandatory agency fee deductions.</p>
<p>3.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption</p>
<p>Any unit member who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenets or<br/>teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations<br/>shall not be required to join or financially support the SCOETA as a condition of<br/>employment; except that such unit member shall pay, in lieu of service fee, sums equal to<br/>such service fee to a non-religious, non-labor organization or charitable fund exempt<br/>from taxation under § 501(c)(3) of Title 26 of the Internal Revenue Code, for example:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation to Assist California Teachers</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mustard Seed</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WEAVE</p>
<p>Such payment shall be made on or before the (same date as cash dues/fees) of each<br/>school year.</p>
<p>3.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proof of Payment for Exemption</p>
<p>Proof of payment and a written statement of objection along with verifiable evidence of<br/>membership in a religious body whose traditional tenets or teachings object to joining or<br/>financially supporting employee organizations, pursuant to Article 3.03, shall be made on<br/>an annual basis to SCOETA and SCOE as a condition of continued exemption from the<br/>provisions of Articles 3.01 and 3.02. Proof of payment shall be in the form of receipts<br/>and/or canceled checks indicating the amount paid, date of payment, and to whom<br/>payment in lieu of the service fee has been made. Such proof shall be presented on or<br/>before (same date as cash dues/fees) of each school year.</p>
<p>3.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Fee-Paying Member Cost of Services</p>
<p>Any unit member making payments as set forth in Articles 3.03 and 3.04, and who<br/>requests that the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Agreement be used in his or<br/>her behalf, shall be responsible for paying the reasonable cost of using said grievance or<br/>arbitration procedures.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>3.06</p>
<p>Remission of Fees</p>
<p>With respect to all sums deducted by SCOE pursuant to Articles 3.01 and 3.02, whether<br/>for membership dues or agency fee, SCOE agrees promptly to remit such monies to<br/>SCOETA accompanied by an alphabetical list of unit members for whom such<br/>deductions have been made, categorizing them as to membership or non-membership in<br/>SCOETA, and indicating any changes in personnel from the list previously furnished.</p>
<p>3.07 Agreement to Furnish Information</p>
<p>The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by SCOE to fulfill the<br/>provisions of Article 3.03.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV<br/>RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION</p>
<p>4.01 Right to Representation</p>
<p>When a potential grievance and/or other employee concerns are being addressed, prior to<br/>any formalized process, certificated employees shall be advised by their immediate<br/>supervisor of their right to representation by SCOETA or another person of their choice.</p>
<p>ARTICLE V<br/>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>5.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to the problems which may from time to time arise affecting the<br/>welfare or working conditions of teachers. Both parties agree that these proceedings will<br/>be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>

Failure at any step of this<br/>procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance within the specified limits shall<br/>permit lodging an appeal at the next step of the procedure within the time allotted had the<br/>decision been given. Failure to appeal a decision within the specified time limits shall be<br/>deemed an acceptance of the decision.</p>

<p>5.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presentation</p>
<p>A certificated employee or his/her representative, or both, may present a grievance while<br/>on duty.

Such<br/>approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>5.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation</p>
<p>The grievant may be represented by SCOETA or any eligible representative of his/her<br/>own choosing, other than another employee organization, whether or not that<br/>representative is a certificated employee, at any formal and informal step of this<br/>procedure.</p>

<p>5.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice to Association</p>
<p>A unit member may at any time present grievances to the employer, and have such<br/>grievances resolved, without the intervention of SCOETA, as long as the resolution is<br/>reached prior to arbitration and such resolution is not inconsistent with terms of the<br/>written agreement. If an employee presents a grievance on his/her own behalf, SCOETA<br/>shall have the right to be present and state its views at all grievance meetings.

The complainant will be requested to include the name of each<br/>employee involved, the date of the incident, and a brief but specific summary of the<br/>complaint and the facts surrounding it. However, if the complainant either can’t or<br/>refuses to, the matter will still be subject to review by the Deputy Superintendent or<br/>designee. In those instances where notice of the complaint will neither risk the<br/>integrity of the investigation nor interfere with law enforcement, the Deputy<br/>Superintendent shall notify the certificated employee and investigate the complaint or<br/>allegation within ten (10) days.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints which cannot be substantiated to the satisfaction of SCOE shall not be<br/>written up and placed in the employee’s personnel file or serve as a basis for any<br/>action against an employee. All notes or written memos not substantiated to the<br/>satisfaction of SCOE shall be destroyed.</p>

Areas of concern about either alleged misconduct or<br/>performance should be discussed with the unit member in a face to face meeting<br/>within ten (10) working days after the supervisor observed the problem or learned of<br/>the facts giving rise to the concern. If the unit member is impaired in such a manner<br/>that immediate removal from the classroom is necessary, the administrator may<br/>proceed with the investigation and postpone the discussion with the unit member until<br/>the unit member is capable of responding.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member will be given an opportunity during the work day when the unit<br/>member is not responsible for students to initial and date the report of the<br/>investigation and to prepare a written response. If the unit member furnishes the<br/>supervisor with a written response within the ten (10) day period before the report is<br/>sent to the Superintendent, or placed into his/her personnel file, the unit member’s<br/>response will be attached to the report when sent to the Superintendent or it is placed<br/>in the file.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the complaint remains unresolved after review by the investigator, the investigator<br/>shall refer the complaint, along with a report and analysis of the situation to the<br/>Superintendent or designee for resolution. A copy of this report will be provided to<br/>the employee against whom the complaint is lodged.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to a determination as to the disposition of the complaint, should the<br/>Superintendent in his sole discretion feel that it would aid a resolution to the matter,<br/>the Superintendent may allow for a hearing on the complaint before a designee of<br/>SCOE. The Superintendent’s determination shall be final except as the matter is<br/>appropriately subject to the Uniform Complaint Process or the grievance procedure.<br/>The Superintendent or designee will make a determination as to the disposition of the<br/>complaint, and will inform the complainant and named employee in writing within<br/>thirty (30) days of receiving the supervisor’s written report.</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a program of study or travel is interrupted because of serious accident or illness<br/>during sabbatical leave and the accident or illness is properly vouched for by a<br/>qualified physician, such interruption shall not constitute a violation of the contract or<br/>prejudice the staff member against receiving the rights or benefits provided for under<br/>the terms of the sabbatical leave. However, this provision is based on the fact that<br/>such interruption does not extend over a period of time that would cause the purposes<br/>of the sabbatical leave to be abandoned. In such latter case, the sabbatical leave shall<br/>be terminated and either a second leave or a leave for absence due to illness or injury<br/>may be substituted by mutual agreement. In all cases of serious accident or illness of<br/>a certificated employee on sabbatical leave, the Superintendent shall be promptly</p>

<p>equal, then the applicant with the greatest seniority in SCOE service shall be given the<br/>leave.</p>

<p>11.35 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank</p>
<p>SCOE offers a catastrophic leave program available to all SCOE employees. This<br/>program is voluntary and participating employees are permitted to donate eligible leave<br/>credits to assist eligible employees when that employee or a member of his or her family<br/>suffers from a catastrophic illness or injury as defined by EC 44043.5 (see below).</p>
<p>“Catastrophic illness” or “injury” means an illness or injury that is expected to<br/>incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time, or that incapacitates a<br/>member of the employee’s family which incapacity requires the employee to take<br/>time off from work for an extended period of time to care for that family member,<br/>and taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship for the employee<br/>because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave and other paid time<br/>off.</p>
<p>For purposes of this section, a “day” shall be a day that the employee is expected to be on<br/>duty as determined by his or her contract with SCOE. Days shall be contributed without<br/>regard to the daily rate of the employee participant.</p>
<p>The bank will be administered by a committee comprised of two members appointed by<br/>SCOETA, two members appointed by CSEA and two members appointed by<br/>management.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>Participation in the bank is voluntary and requires an annual contribution of one sick day<br/>per school year. Donations will be made each year by September 30. Employees may<br/>donate sick leave if they have a minimum of five days accumulated sick leave.</p>
<p>Rules and regulations for the catastrophic leave bank will be developed and administered<br/>by the bank committee. Days in the bank will accumulate from year to year.</p>
<p>11.36 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal Illness Leave</p>
<p>When a member has written verification from a doctor that an illness appears to be<br/>terminal, SCOE shall pay to that member his/her full monthly salary for each month or<br/>part thereof that the member survives for a period not to exceed twelve (12) calendar<br/>months after the exhaustion of earned, accumulative sick leave and vacation days.</p>
<p>11.37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CalSTRS Reduced Workload Program</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equivalent to a minimum of one-half the number of sequential days of service<br/>required by the unit member’s contract of employment during his/her final year of<br/>service in a full time position, and commencing on the first day of the first half of the<br/>work year, or the first day of the second half of the work year; or</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equivalent to a minimum of half-time employment per day for the full school year.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member must have reached the age of 55 years prior to a reduced services<br/>employment. The unit member must have been employed full time in a position<br/>requiring certification for at least ten (10) years of which the immediately preceding<br/>five (5) years were full time employment.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be paid a salary which is a minimum of one-half of the salary<br/>that would have been earned had the unit member not elected to exercise the option of<br/>reduced services employment. The unit member’s State Teachers Retirement System<br/>(CalSTRS) contribution paid by both SCOE and the unit member shall be the same as<br/>if the unit member taught full time.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOE shall provide participating unit members with health and welfare benefits as<br/>though they were full time employees.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall file application for reduced services employment with the<br/>Personnel department by July 1 or January 1 for the following school year.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reduced services unit member may be returned to full time employment only with<br/>the mutual consent of the unit member and SCOE.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation of this article must result in no cost to SCOE.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>11.38 Family Medical Leave</p>
<p>Employees shall be entitled to family medical leave pursuant to the Family Medical<br/>Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Family Medical Leave Act (CFMLA). It is<br/>intended that current leave entitlements shall run concurrently with FMLA and CFMLA<br/>leave.

<p>The support provider works on a one to one and small group basis with participating<br/>teachers, offering guidance, personal coaching and consulting feedback. Typical<br/>activities include classroom visits, assistance with lesson planning, modeling lessons and<br/>individualized guidance and planning professional development. Available positions will<br/>be determined based on the number of participating teachers requiring service.</p>

The job description (available from Personnel) reflects specific<br/>qualification standards which include but are not limited to knowledge of beginning<br/>teacher development and knowledge of the state-adopted academic content and<br/>performance standards for students, “common core,” and the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession.</p>
<p>15.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term</p>
<p>A support provider’s initial term will be one or two years, but the terms of the initial<br/>support providers will be staggered to provide a core of experienced support providers<br/>while allowing for others to compete for open positions. Terms may be extended by<br/>mutual agreement of the BTSA Director and the support provider.</p>
<p>15.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation</p>
<p>Support providers will be paid a stipend of $1500 for supporting one teacher, $2800 for<br/>supporting two teachers, and $3900 for supporting three teachers.</p>
<p>15.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTSA Support Providers Committee</p>
<p>SCOETA and SCOE will form a balanced committee (BTSA Support Providers<br/>Committee) to review the application process, create a job description, and from time to<br/>time make support provider recommendations, including, but not limited to, term<br/>continuity.</p>

<p>21.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement of Intent</p>
<p>The parties agree that it is in the best interest of SCOE and its constituencies to<br/>inclusively and cooperatively engage in decision making activities with the goal of<br/>promoting continuous improvement in the quality of organizational support services,<br/>student learning experiences and teaching outcomes. We believe this can best be<br/>accomplished through program decision-making practices that constructively involve<br/>relevant stakeholders likely to be affected by the implementation of resulting decisions.<br/>These stakeholders shall be certificated, administrative and classified staff. Sites may<br/>also include related agencies or business partners.</p>
<p>21.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scope of Authority of Decision-Making Teams</p>
<p>The primary intent of this article is to allow flexibility in the development of decision¬<br/>making teams, while ensuring that directly affected programs consisting of educational<br/>staff and students are provided an effective vehicle for communicating concerns and</p>
<p>developing recommendations. It is agreed that shared decision-making teams will be<br/>responsible at a minimum, for participation in development of the following:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering and disseminating information and facilitating communication among staff</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing annual input for ongoing staff development activities, which address both<br/>site based and organizational needs and goals.</p>

<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing site/program based meeting schedules for the purposes of<br/>implementation of this article.</p>
<p>21.03 Review and Alignment of Article XXI</p>
<p>This article shall be reviewed as necessary to ensure that the intent, as stated herein, is<br/>adhered to by parties involved.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XXII<br/>BENEFITS</p>
<p>22.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entitlement to Payment of Premiums</p>
<p>SCOE shall provide for the payment of such insurance premiums and other benefits for<br/>employees and their dependents, and retired persons as stated herein. Premium payments<br/>shall be paid for employees working less than six (6) hours on the same ratio as their<br/>employment bears to eight (8) hours.</p>
<p>22.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans Available</p>
<p>Employees may select from those medical, dental, vision and insurance plans offered by<br/>SCOE. Additionally, there are other tax-exempt benefits that are available under the<br/>provisions of the IRC 125 plans. SCOE offers a Cafeteria Plan for its employees who<br/>meet the plan's eligibility requirements. The IRC 125 plan allows an employee to shelter<br/>certain benefits provided under the plan on a pre-tax basis.</p>
<p>All eligible employees will have SCOE contribute a monthly health benefit allocation<br/>twelfthly of $588.45 for health benefits as set out in 22.04 below. That health benefit<br/>allowance will equal seven-thousand sixty-one dollars and forty cents ($7061.40)<br/>annually. Employees hired before January 1, 2014 who provide proof of other coverage<br/>in alternative medical benefits and who waive taking any medical plan, will receive a<br/>cash-in-lieu allocation of three hundred dollars monthly or three thousand six hundred<br/>($3600.00) annually. Those hired after that date who provide proof and opt out of<br/>medical benefits will receive one hundred dollars ($100) monthly or $1200 annually.</p>
<p>Contingent upon agreements with the other unit and management, effective January 1,<br/>2015, SCOE agrees to increase the monthly allocation for two party and family by three<br/>hundred and fifteen dollars ($315).</p>
<p>Employees who opt out of the medical benefit plan will be permanently excluded from<br/>post-retirement medical benefits.</p>
<p>The Benefit Expansion Fund will be examined annually in negotiations and<br/>recommendations will be made to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>22.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrollment</p>
<p>Employees must enroll within thirty (30) days after date of eligibility.</p>
<p>22.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entitlement to Plans</p>
<p>The benefits offered by SCOE include a medical policy, a dental policy, and a vision<br/>policy. The current selection of benefits is provided by the California Public Employee<br/>Retirement System (CalPERS). SCOE will provide a $40,000 term life insurance policy<br/>for full time employees. The monthly dollar amount contributed for health benefits shall<br/>be the same for 2006-07 as in 2005-06. SCOE’s responsibility for 2007-08 unless<br/>modified by agreement with SCOETA will be the dollar amounts paid in 2006-07.</p>
<p>Persons determined to be domestic partners under the guidelines of the State of California<br/>shall be eligible to participate in any insurance plan that is appropriate.</p>
<p>22.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Insurance upon Retirement</p>
<p>SCOE shall provide payment of health insurance coverage for all eligible retired<br/>employees only upon entering CalSTRS following the completion of the necessary years<br/>of service.</p>
<p>The parties agree to recommend to the Superintendent that a portion of lottery monies<br/>should be designated for the Retirees Benefit Fund.</p>
<p>All those who retire from SCOE pursuant to the requirements of the California Public<br/>Employee Retirement System [as long as SCOE is a participant in the California Public<br/>Employee Retirement System (CalPERS) Health Benefit Program] and who satisfy the<br/>requirements of fifteen years with SCOE as set out in the Vesting Resolution for unit<br/>members of the exclusive representative SCOETA will be entitled to the minimum<br/>contribution required by Government Code section 22892 (b) (1). SCOE and SCOETA<br/>acknowledge that participation in the CalPERS Health Benefit Program requires<br/>compliance with CalPERS rules for right of survivorship.</p>
<p>22.06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medicare</p>
<p>Current retirees will be provided the least expensive medical insurance for single<br/>employees. Current retired employees or future retired employees may elect from the</p>
<p>negotiated palette of medical health benefits but are required to pay the difference<br/>monthly should the plan selected cost more than the least expensive medical insurance<br/>for single employees. An eligible retiree must apply for all available Medicare benefits if<br/>those benefits would lower SCOE’s future cost for health benefits. SCOE’s responsibility<br/>would then be the lower of the cost of the Medicare supplement or the least expensive<br/>regular medical insurance for single employees.</p>
<p>22.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplemental Retiree Health Program</p>
<p>Over and above the minimum required contribution for retirees, there will be a<br/>supplemental retiree health program not subject to the regulation of PEMHCA. The<br/>supplemental retiree health program will be the difference between the CalPERS<br/>minimum and the cost for a single employee medical policy. The service requirement for<br/>the supplemental health benefits will be the completion of fifteen years with SCOE and<br/>meeting the requirements set forth in Article 22.02. When an employee retires under<br/>CalPERS regulations with fifteen or more years of service with SCOE, the employee will<br/>be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of the least expensive medical<br/>coverage for a single employee.</p>
<p>22.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandpersoning Current Employees</p>
<p>Current employees (those hired on or before SCOE ratification) who cannot complete the<br/>newly required number of years prior to age 55 will be provided a transition exception if<br/>they meet the minimum requirements for CalSTRS retirement. Those employees will be<br/>provided the cost of the least expensive medical health benefit for single employees.</p>
<p>22.09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement Service Credit</p>
<p>The requirement for years of service set out above must be CalSTRS or CalPERS<br/>credited years of service that the regular employee worked with SCOE as set out in<br/>Article 22.07.

<p>New employees (those hired on or before SCOE ratification) will be provided the option<br/>of electing supplemental retiree health benefits or waiving them. These employees who<br/>meet the vesting requirements of the CalPERS Resolution for SCOETA would continue<br/>to be eligible for the CalPERS minimum contribution as required by Government Code<br/>sections 22892 (b) (1) and 22895 regardless of their willingness to participate in the<br/>supplemental retiree health benefit program (provided, of course, and conditioned upon<br/>SCOE remaining with CalPERS for healthcare).

<p>If an employee leaves SCOE for any reason prior to qualifying for Supplemental Retiree<br/>Health Benefits, SCOE shall reimburse an amount equal to the participating employee’s<br/>deducted contribution from a segregated special reserve. Upon the employee’s written<br/>request, SCOE shall return the funds within twenty (20) days of the request.</p>
<p>22.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability for Current Employees and Retirees</p>
<p>SCOE will pay to the CalPERS Trust a sum of money as specified below:</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 30 days of the agreement with the CalPERS Trust, SCOE shall make a<br/>Contribution to the Trust in an amount equal to the Ending Balance of SCOE Fund 20<br/>for the 2007 Fiscal Year (estimated at $9,700,000).</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a prorated monthly basis or as otherwise required by CalPERS, SCOE shall make<br/>annual contributions to the CalPERS Trust in accordance with this agreement and the<br/>rules in the participation agreements with CalPERS, which shall consist of:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amount equal to 3.92% (2% + 1.92%) of the non-exempt salary payroll cost<br/>for 2007 Fiscal Year;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amount equal to 4.92% (2% + 2.92%) of the non-exempt salary payroll cost<br/>for 2008 Fiscal Year;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amount equal to 5.42% (2.5% + 2.92%) of the non-exempt salary payroll cost<br/>for 2009 Fiscal Year;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amount equal to 5.67% (2.75% + 2.92%) of the non-exempt salary payroll<br/>cost for 2010 Fiscal Year;</p>

<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties intend that SCOE’s benefit plan invested in the CalPERS Trust be funded<br/>on an actuarially sound basis. Therefore, after 2012 but for a period of time not to<br/>exceed thirty (30) years, SCOE shall make annual Contributions to the CalPERS<br/>Trust in an amount equal to 6.42% (3.5% + 2.92%) of the non-exempt salary payroll<br/>cost, provided that:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the agreements with the CalPERS Trust, SCOE shall conduct<br/>actuarial studies of the adequacy of SCOE’s benefit plans invested in CalPERS<br/>Trust Fund [i.e., funding on an “actuarially sound” basis],</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At such a time that the contributions to the CalPERS Trust are adequate to fully<br/>fund benefits:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOE’s 6.42% of the non-exempt salary payroll cost Contributions to the<br/>Benefits Trust may be modified; and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOE and SCOETA shall meet and negotiate, within the meaning of<br/>California Government Code subdivision 3540.1(h), such additional<br/>Contributions - if any - as may be required to continue the operation of the<br/>CalPERS Trust on a financially sound and solvent ongoing basis.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that there is a financial crisis that prevents SCOE’s delivering<br/>core instructional programs, the parties may negotiate a reduction to the above<br/>percentage contribution. This reduction must be mutually agreed by<br/>SCOETA, and SCOE.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCOE shall pay contributions to the CalPERS Trust in a timely manner and on such<br/>terms as are required by SCOE’s agreement with CalPERS and the terms of this<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To comply with the parties’ fiduciary duties, the Employer shall pay the initial cost of<br/>new trustee training provided by the International Foundation for Employee Benefit<br/>Programs, on behalf of both the employer and union trustees.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If CalPERS limits or precludes SCOE’s participation eligibility or it is determined<br/>that continued participation is no longer desirable, the fund held in SCOE’s CalPERS<br/>Trust shall be transferred to a qualified joint trust in compliance with CalPERS<br/>Regulations. SCOE and SCOETA shall open negotiations to implement this<br/>provision, including but not limited to the allocation of funds among the units, and the<br/>provisions of a mutually acceptable Declaration and Agreement of Trust and such<br/>other matters as the parties deem necessary.</p>
<p>22.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer of Funds</p>
<p>Additionally, upon the formation of an operational Trust, SCOE will transfer the funds as<br/>set out above in the Retiree Trust Addendum for SCOETA.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXIII<br/>SALARIES</p>
<p>23.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary Calculation</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Sacramento County Office of Education to offer competitive salaries<br/>and to meet annually to discuss available resources to meet this goal. The current salary<br/>schedule can be found at <a href="http://www.scoe.net/personnel">http://www.scoe.net/personnel</a>.</p>
<p>For 2014-15, SCOE agrees to provide a salary schedule increase of five percent (5%)<br/>effective July 1, 2014, two and one half percent (2.5%) effective July 1, 2015, and any<br/>increase for 2016-2017 in salary and health benefits will be exclusively determined by<br/>SCOE. In other words, if SCOE determines based upon revenues, expenditures, and<br/>“low income program continuation” to increase salary or health benefits in 2015-16<br/>and/or 2016-17, SCOE may do so and it will not either reopen the CBA for negotiations<br/>or constitute unilateral action.</p>
