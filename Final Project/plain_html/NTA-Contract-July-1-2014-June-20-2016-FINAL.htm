<p>ARTICLE I<br/>AGREEMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bilateral and binding Agreement is entered into this 27th day of May 2014, by<br/>and between the Board of Trustees of the Natomas Unified School District, hereafter<br/>called &quot;District&quot;, and the Natomas Teachers Association (who is affiliated with<br/>CTA/NEA), hereafter called the &quot;Association&quot;. &quot;Board&quot; in this document refers to the<br/>Natomas Unified School District Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Division 4, of Title I, Chapter 10.7 of the<br/>California Government Code commencing with Section 3540.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term - This contract will be in full force and effect until June 30, 2016 or until a new<br/>Agreement has been agreed to by both parties.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to provide the Association with opportunities to assist the District to make<br/>reasonable budget assumptions, funding allocations, and enrollment projections; to<br/>better manage position control and staffing assignments; and, to make reductions in<br/>expenses that do not require collective bargaining to implement, as well as to develop<br/>other systems and procedures for improving the District’s financial position that the<br/>parties may agree is warranted:</p>
<p>1. A group of up to three Association representatives shall meet and consult with<br/>up to three District representatives as designated by the Superintendent; one<br/>shall be the Assistant Superintendent of Business Services. The meeting shall<br/>occur on a monthly basis (unless otherwise agreed), and be scheduled at the<br/>mutual convenience of the parties</p>
<p>l</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>ARTICLE II<br/>RECOGNITION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the express purpose of negotiation to meet and negotiate deliberations, the District<br/>recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative for the unit of employees<br/>defined as: all certificated employees except those excluded in B below.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit shall exclude those employees who are designated as management, confidential<br/>or supervisory, substitutes, non-NTA summer school employees, special education<br/>program specialists, non-NTA adult education teachers and all employees that hold a<br/>position that does not require a certificate.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>ARTICLE III<br/>GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>Grievance Procedure<br/>Relating only to Agreement Disputes</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the article is to provide a procedure for the consideration of grievances<br/>pertaining to an Agreement dispute, which is defined as an alleged violation,<br/>misapplication or misinterpretation of the specific provisions of this Agreement by an<br/>employee in the bargaining unit. This grievance procedure shall not be construed by either<br/>party to allow for class action grievances.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This grievance procedure applies only to items covered in this Agreement.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any employee may present grievances relating to an Agreement dispute to his/her<br/>employer and have such grievances adjusted without the intervention of the exclusive<br/>representative or employee organization as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with<br/>the terms of this Agreement. An authorized NTA representative may file a grievance on<br/>behalf of the employee with or without the consent of the employee. The public school<br/>employer shall not agree to the adjustment or resolution of the grievance until the exclusive<br/>representative or employee organization has received a copy of the grievance and the<br/>proposed resolution and has been given five (5) days to file a response.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the exclusive representative or employee organization agree that every<br/>effort will be made by management and the grievant to settle grievances at the lowest<br/>possible level.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided in this grievance procedure may be extended or shortened by mutual<br/>Agreement when in writing and signed by the parties. Failure by the District to adhere to<br/>time limits shall permit the grievant to appeal to the next step (higher level). Failure of the<br/>grievant to adhere to time limits shall mean that the employee is satisfied with the latest<br/>answer and waives any right to further appeal within the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the<br/>personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts will be made to schedule meetings for the processing of grievances at times, which<br/>will not interfere with the regular workday of the participants. Grievance procedure<br/>hearings under Steps 0, 1 and 2 will not be conducted more than one (1) hour before or<br/>later than one (1) hour beyond scheduled student attendance at the school site. These<br/>same hours shall apply when students are not in attendance unless a mutually agreed<br/>upon time is established.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a grievance has been filed by an employee, the grievant may terminate the<br/>grievance at any time by giving written notice to the public school employer or its designee.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>Failure to comply with time limits, to attend scheduled meetings to discuss or hear the<br/>grievance, or to provide requested information at the grievants’ disposal relating to the<br/>subject matter of the grievance, shall be deemed a termination of the grievance by the<br/>employee. The public school District shall give written notice of such termination to the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant has the right to have a representative present at any step of this grievance<br/>procedure. The grievant, however, must be present at each step of the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance - A grievance shall mean a complaint by a teacher, group of teachers,<br/>or the Natomas Teachers’ Association (NTA), in its own name, alleging that there<br/>has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>

<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timelines:</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either the District or the NTA elects to go to mediation, the party so electing must<br/>notify the other party in writing within fifteen (15) days following the Step 3 decision.<br/>Both the NTA and the District agree to participate in the process in good faith in an<br/>attempt to reach an equitable resolution.</p>

<p>6</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>Formal Level—Step 5 (Arbitration):</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance which is not settled at Step 4, and which the NTA desires to contest<br/>further, shall be submitted to arbitration as provided herein, but only if the NTA gives<br/>written notice to the District of its desire to arbitrate the Grievance within ten (10)<br/>days after the termination of Step 4.

<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>process to more adequately fit the needs of the non-instructional high school<br/>programs.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members will be notified when and where the agreed upon list of<br/>adjunct duties/activities/committees will be posted. Bargaining unit members by<br/>seniority will have one week to self-select their preferred adjunct duties.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal or his/her designee, after reviewing and analyzing the resulting list for<br/>equity and adequate coverage, may make appropriate assignments where needed.</p>
<p>The traditional calendar work year shall consist of one hundred eighty-three point five</p>
<p>(183.5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days (180 instructional + .5 meeting day +3 staff development days) for returning<br/>teachers.

<p>26</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>will have twelve (12) leave days, subject to the provisions of Article VI, for the year the<br/>offer is in effect.</p>
<p>P. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of three (3) staff development days will be scheduled during the school year.</p>
<p>Q. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this section is to clarify the work year for part-time and partial year<br/>employees.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time employees work the full year, but do not work full time (not equivalent to<br/>1 FTE).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partial year employees work full time each day, but not for the full year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both part-time and partial year employees shall work a specified percentage of<br/>either the traditional or year-round student days. In addition, teachers shall work<br/>three full staff development days.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employees hired after the beginning of the school year, a work calendar will be<br/>established to include remaining teacher work days and staff development days.</p>
<p>R. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Emergency&quot; as used in this article shall be as declared by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher's participation in &quot;Outdoor Education&quot; and/or &quot;Extended Day Activities&quot; will be<br/>voluntary. Teachers not participating with their class will either exchange with another<br/>teacher, or be used in some other educational capacity.</p>
<p>T. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation Time</p>
<p>Full time teachers will be given time during the instructional day in addition to the fifteen<br/>minutes before school to plan, correct papers, prepare lessons, conference with parents<br/>and students, and perform other professional duties. Meetings during prep time will only<br/>be scheduled with the consent of the teacher, except in emergencies.</p>
<p>Part time teachers in grades 7-12 are paid a pro rata amount of salary and benefits and<br/>are expected to use the prep time as described in Article V.</p>
<p>1. When a middle school or high school teacher agrees to an administrative request to<br/>substitute or is assigned to substitute during his/her prep period, the teacher will be<br/>paid $40.00 per period.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each secondary site shall put together a list of teachers who wish to volunteer<br/>to work during their preparation period. This list will be done by period.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a need for substitute teachers during a period, the site<br/>administrator will first go down the list of teachers who have volunteered to <sup>27</sup></p>
<p>27</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>substitute during their preparation period. Once the volunteer list is depleted for<br/>a period, the school shall:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a list of teachers by preparation period.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list will be gone through in order until each teacher has been asked to<br/>substitute before the school can go back to the start of the list.</p>
<p>c. Unless there is an emergency situation in which a class of students will go<br/>without coverage, teachers will not be asked to substitute during their prep<br/>period more than twice per week.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers in grades TK and K have a minimum of (45) forty-five minutes of Physical<br/>Education provided by a Physical Education Specialist per week for preparation in<br/>weeks of five (5) full instructional days. In weeks of less than five (5) full<br/>instructional days, i.e., weeks with holiday, staff development days, minimum days,<br/>the prep time will be scheduled as equitably as the schedule will allow.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers in grades 1, 2, and 3 have a minimum of (60) sixty minutes of Physical<br/>Education provided by a Physical Education Specialist per week for preparation in<br/>weeks of five (5) full instructional days. In weeks of less than five (5) full<br/>instructional days, i.e., weeks with holiday, staff development days, minimum days,<br/>the prep time will be scheduled as equitably as the schedule will allow.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers in grades 4, 5 and 6 at all Elementary schools have a minimum of ninety<br/>(90) minutes of Physical Education provided by a Physical Education Specialist per<br/>week for preparation in weeks of five (5) full instructional days. In weeks of less<br/>than five (5) full days of instruction, i.e., weeks with holidays, staff development<br/>days, minimum days, the prep time will be scheduled as equitably as the schedule<br/>will allow.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on the year round schedule receive approximately the same amount of<br/>prep time for the year as teachers on traditional schedule. Variation will be due to<br/>scheduling of the PE and prep time specialist teachers. Every effort will be made<br/>to have time be equitable and distributed consistently throughout the year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary RSP, TOSAs, reading, physical education and Title I teachers may<br/>schedule prep time within their own educational programs in an amount equitable<br/>to teachers of similar work hours. Elementary SDC teachers team with another<br/>class to ensure equitable prep time in an amount equitable to teachers of similar<br/>work hours.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors, Psychologists and Speech and Language Therapists and all other<br/>eight-hour bargaining unit members will schedule time within their workdays to<br/>prepare for assignments and duties. <sup>28</sup></p>
<p>28</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>U. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year Round Education</p>
<p>In the event that the year round program at a year round school changes, adds tracks or<br/>deviates from the current calendar structure, a committee consisting of four (4 teachers<br/>chosen by the Association from the year round school staff and administrators will meet to<br/>plan the implementation of the changes.</p>
<p>V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the District to hire substitute teachers for classroom teachers, P.E.<br/>teachers, and RSP teachers when they are absent. TOSA, Intervention and Specialist<br/>teachers will not be required to substitute except in emergency situations.</p>
<p>W. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero Period</p>
<p>The workday of a teacher teaching a &quot;zero&quot; period is the same number of minutes as a<br/>teacher at the same grade level; however, the beginning and ending times will differ. If<br/>teachers teach more than five periods at the traditional calendar schools or six periods at<br/>the year round calendar schools, their salary will be increased by a pro rata amount.</p>
<p>X. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option to have up to five (5) current instructional days changed to minimum days to<br/>allow for teacher collaboration (either by grade level or departments), or other entire staff<br/>development activities. It is understood that this collaboration/development time will not<br/>be used for faculty meetings and teachers will attend until what would be the end of a<br/>normal school day. <sup>29</sup></p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bargaining unit members who require and enroll in family coverage will receive nine<br/>hundred ninety-seven dollars and ninety-eight cents ($997.98) per month for the purpose<br/>of funding pre-tax health and dental premium contributions and benefits. Those who enroll<br/>in two party or single parent coverage will receive six hundred sixty-nine dollars and eighty-<br/>five cents ($669.85) for the purpose of funding pre-tax health and dental premium<br/>contributions and benefits. Bargaining unit members, who select single coverage, will<br/>receive five hundred eighty dollars and thirty-six cents ($580.36) per month for the purpose<br/>of funding pre-tax health and dental premium contributions and benefits.</p>
<p>For the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, a one-time, off-schedule payment of one<br/>thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per each bargaining unit member enrolled in medical benefits<br/>will be paid on the October 2014 pay warrant and the October 2015 pay warrant.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members whose first day of employment in the District is for the 2004-<br/>2005 school year whose insurance benefits fall under the District cap of $486.39 will not<br/>receive cash benefits from the difference. No payments will be made to these employees<br/>in lieu of health benefits.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For part-time bargaining unit members who are regularly scheduled to work for one-half<br/>(V2) of the school day or more, the District will increase the salary of each such individual<br/>a pro rata share of amounts in A, B &amp; C for the purpose of funding pre-tax health and<br/>dental premium contributions.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may enroll with the company managing the District’s 125 Cafeteria Plan to<br/>use pre-tax salary deductions for dependent care and un-reimbursed medical expenses,<br/>including orthodontics.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees on approved leaves of absence without pay will have the option to continue to<br/>receive health and welfare coverage as specified by this article by submitting a personal<br/>check made out to the school district for the full amount of the monthly premium. This is<br/>contingent upon the insurance carrier's Agreement to provide such coverage. <sup>30</sup></p>
<p>30</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An advisory committee comprised of members of NTA and the District shall be formed to<br/>make a recommendation to the Board and the Association for review and ratification of a<br/>replacement for the loss of a medical program.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retiree Benefits</p>
<p>The District will pay single medical premiums (medical, dental, and vision) up to the<br/>amount allocated for other certificated bargaining unit members until they reach age sixty-<br/>five (65) for employees who have worked in the district for at least fifteen (15) consecutive<br/>years prior to retirement and enter the retirement system upon leaving the District.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for retiree health benefits, the bargaining unit member must be<br/>enrolled in the plan the year prior to the year of retirement that he/she wishes to have after<br/>retiring from the District. This includes dental and vision. If a bargaining unit member is<br/>currently receiving cash back in lieu of insurance coverage, he/she may continue receiving<br/>cash back upon retirement from the District, however, IRS considers this taxable income.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cal PERS Health Benefits</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits offered in Section H, the District will offer all retirees the option<br/>of participating in Cal PERS health benefits plans. The coverage is for life contingent on<br/>the District participating in Cal PERS. Unlike section H, retirees who participate in a Cal<br/>PERS Plan do not need to have been employed with the district for 15 years, nor have<br/>been enrolled in the plan the year prior to the year of retirement that she/he wishes to have<br/>after retiring from the District.</p>
<p>If a retiree not covered in section H elects to participate in the District medical plan, the<br/>District will contribute to medical coverage only according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From July 1,2004 to December 31,2004, the District will contribute $1 per month.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005, the District will contribute $3.42 per<br/>month.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From January 1, 2006 to December 31,2006, the District will contribute $6.65 per<br/>month.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District contributions for the Cal PERS retiree health benefits for Natomas<br/>Teachers Association shall end on June 30, 2008.</p>
<p>All past bargaining unit retirees will be contacted and offered this option; newly retiring unit<br/>members will be offered this option upon retirement.</p>
<p>If the Association elects not to participate in Cal PERS, this section becomes void. <sup>31</sup></p>
<p>31</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and the District agree to create a Catastrophic Leave Bank<br/>(“Bank”) effective July 1, 2001.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave will permit credentialed employees of the District to donate<br/>days to a Bank that will administer those days according to the terms of this<br/>section.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Catastrophic illness or injury” is defined as a life-threatening illness or injury<br/>that is expected to incapacitate the employee for an extended period of time or<br/>that incapacitates a member of the employee’s family whose incapacity<br/>requires the employee to take time off from work for an extended period of time<br/>to care for that family member and taking extended time off work creates a<br/>financial hardship for the employee because he/she has exhausted all his/her<br/>sick leave, excluding differential leave. A doctor’s verification is required.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Employee’s family” is defined as husband, wife, son, daughter, stepchildren,<br/>domestic partner, or parent of the employee. Leave requested to care for any <sup>38</sup></p>
<p>38</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>relative with a catastrophic illness or injury, whom employee has legal<br/>guardianship of, will be considered for approval by the Catastrophic Leave<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the Bank shall accumulate in the Bank from year to year.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank shall be administered by a Joint Committee (“Committee”) of the<br/>Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, two members appointed by the<br/>Association President and one member appointed by the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All credentialed employees of the District (excluding substitutes) are eligible to<br/>contribute to the Bank.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary but requires contributions to the Bank. Only<br/>contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees who elect not to join the Bank must wait until the beginning of the<br/>next school year to join the Bank. The beginning of the next school year is<br/>defined as July 1.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution, on the appropriate form, must be authorized by the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members wishing to cancel must notify the Human Resources Department in<br/>writing by July 1. Sick leave contributed to the Bank shall not be returned.<br/>Forms for cancelling contributions to the leave bank shall be sent out no later<br/>than May 15 of the preceding school year.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be initially made between July 1 and September 15.<br/>Employees returning from extended leave and new hires will be permitted to<br/>contribute within thirty (30) calendar days of beginning work. The District shall<br/>supply enrollment forms for the bank to all employees.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees wishing to participate in the Bank shall make an initial contribution<br/>of one day the first year of participation. Part-time employees shall have their<br/>contributions prorated. Continued membership requires a yearly donation of<br/>one day per year unless the Bank maximum is reached.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for Withdrawal from the Bank</p>
<p>a. Application shall be made when it becomes apparent that Catastrophic Leave<br/>may be needed. <sup>39</sup></p>
<p>39</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must use all accrued sick leave available to them before becoming<br/>eligible to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of ten (10) workdays of illness or injury must be covered by the<br/>participant’s own sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay the first time<br/>the participant qualifies for a withdrawal from the Bank. If the same illness/injury<br/>reoccurs in the same year, the ten-day requirement will be waived.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family members (as defined in N.I.d) and legal guardians may apply for<br/>catastrophic leave on behalf of the unit member.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave is granted for thirty (30) days at a time. Continuation of leave requires<br/>another doctor verification and reevaluation by the Committee. A participant’s<br/>total withdrawal from the Bank may not exceed one hundred eighty-three (183)<br/>workdays per catastrophic illness or injury. When requesting leave to care for<br/>a parent, a maximum often (10) days per year will be granted.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unit member is receiving Workers’ Compensation or Disability Insurance,<br/>no leave will be granted until compensation is exhausted.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no leave days are available in the Bank, the District has no obligation to</p>
<p>provide leave.</p>
<p>Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee maintains records of employees participating, receives<br/>requests, verifies validity, approves, and communicates actions to members<br/>and to the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions will be final and made in writing to the applicant within ten (10)<br/>working days of the application to the Committee.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All requests and actions by the Committee will be confidential.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will keep records and notify the Committee monthly of new<br/>members and days remaining in the Bank.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this provision is rescinded, the Committee will continue to administer<br/>Catastrophic Leave days until the days in the Bank are exhausted.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of days in the Bank shall be seven hundred fifty (750).<br/>No more than one (1) day of sick leave shall be donated in a year. If the number<br/>of days accumulated exceeds the maximum number of days, no contributions<br/>will be assessed for that year except for new members wishing to join the Bank. <sup>40</sup></p>

<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed by the parties that their principle objective is to maintain or<br/>improve the quality of education in the District. It is further understood and agreed that<br/>this objective can be more readily achieved by the manifest willingness on the part of the<br/>District to assist all employees in improving their professional skills. The six (6) California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession, with minor modifications, are the basic framework<br/>for the evaluation process. (Appendix C: Form A)</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every probationary employee shall be formally evaluated by the site administrator,<br/>in writing, at least once each school year and have at least two formal observations,<br/>which will be thirty (30) minutes in length, with informal observations taking place<br/>as needed. Probationary and temporary teachers who are employed by October 1<br/>will be evaluated by February 15.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every permanent employee will be evaluated at least every three years and will<br/>have at least one formal observation, which will be thirty (30) minutes in length, with<br/>informal observations taking place as needed. Permanent employees may, upon<br/>submission of written request by the third week of school, receive an annual written<br/>evaluation. Teacher evaluations will be completed by May 1 unless the teacher’s<br/>absence makes this impossible.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher receives a rating of “Needs Improvement” on the Formal Summary<br/>Evaluation, the teacher will be evaluated again the following year. A rating of<br/>“Needs Improvement” for an additional year will require that the teacher participate<br/>in the Professional Teacher Support Program (PTSP). (Article XII, Section E,<br/>“Referred Teacher”)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers receiving a rating of “Unsatisfactory” shall be mandated to participate in<br/>the Professional Teacher Support Program. (Article XII, Section E, “Referred<br/>Teacher”)</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Sequence</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Conference: A general conference and staff orientation shall be held within<br/>the first thirty (30) workdays of the school year to review the evaluation criteria,<br/>procedures, timelines and terms set forth in this article.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal Setting Conference: A goal setting conference between the evaluator and the<br/>employee shall be held prior to the end of the seventh week of the school year or<br/>the teacher’s work year to discuss: <sup>43</sup></p>
<p>43</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objectives and standards to be achieved during the evaluation period as<br/>outlined on the Professional Goal Setting Form. (Appendix C: Form B, Sections<br/>I - IV);</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A schedule for observation, conferencing and the evaluation completion date.<br/>In the event of a disagreement over the objectives, goals, strategies, selected<br/>standards, evidence chosen and/or evaluation schedule, the teacher and the<br/>evaluator shall:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a good faith effort to resolve the differences themselves.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the disagreement persists, either party may invite the superintendent/<br/>designee to assist in resolving the differences, and/or to adjudicate the<br/>dispute.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the teacher disputes the superintendent/designee’s decision he/she may<br/>within ten (10) workdays provide a written statement to be attached to the</p>
<p>evaluation form.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluatee may request, at any time, an additional formal observation by an<br/>evaluator. If there is mutual agreement, an additional formal observation will be</p>
<p>held.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-observation conference: Prior to the formal observation, the principal/ designee<br/>and the employee shall discuss the elements, including goals and objectives, on<br/>which the observation/evaluation is to be based. Teachers submit the Pre¬<br/>observation Form and the Lesson Plan at this time. The formal observation(s) shall<br/>be arranged by the evaluator and the employee at least two (2) working days in<br/>advance of the observation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations: The principal/designee will conduct formal observations which<br/>address the Natomas Unified School District Professional Teaching Standards.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Observation Conferences: The post-observation conferences shall be held<br/>within five (5) working days following the scheduled formal observations. Prior to<br/>the post-observation conferences, the teacher will submit the Reflection section of<br/>the Lesson Plan to the administrator. During the conference, the principal/designee<br/>presents the completed Formal Observation Form to the teacher.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal observations may be held at the discretion of the evaluator with appropriate<br/>conferences, as needed any time during the year. The administrator will provide<br/>the teacher with timely feedback if there are areas of concern.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary Evaluation: By May 1, the evaluator and teacher shall meet to review the<br/>teacher’s job performance and progress, and to sign the Summary Evaluation<br/>document. Informal observations, formal observations, and adherence to <sup>44</sup></p>
<p>44</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>professional assignments and responsibilities will be considered in the formal<br/>evaluation. The Summary Evaluation should reflect evidence, data and information<br/>gathered by the administrator, and will be collected from observable behavior<br/>and/or written documentation (lesson plan forms, teacher logs, student work,<br/>observation notes, etc.) This information will be discussed with the teacher in a<br/>timely manner and prior to the Summary Evaluation. A teacher may present or the<br/>evaluator may request additional logs, records and other evidence to support<br/>adherence to the six Teaching Standards. The teacher’s signature shall not imply<br/>concurrence, only that he/she has had an opportunity to review and discuss the<br/>content. Within ten (10) working days of the Summary Evaluation Conference, the<br/>teacher may file a written response and such response will be filed with the<br/>evaluation document.</p>
<p>8. Professional Goal Setting Summary Conference: Either during the teacher’s<br/>Summary Evaluation Conference or by June 1, the teacher will review their<br/>Reflection of the Professional Goal Setting Form (Form B) with the<br/>principal/designee and discuss recommendations for future goals.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the certificated employee and the evaluator shall take action to correct any cited<br/>deficiencies. Such action may include specific recommendations for improvement, direct<br/>assistance in implementing such recommendations, release time for the certificated<br/>employee to visit and observe other similar classes in other schools.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bargaining unit members will not be required to do formal Summary Evaluations of other<br/>unit members' evaluations.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative and/or unsatisfactory evaluation shall not be predicated upon information or<br/>material of a derogatory or critical nature which has been received by the evaluator from<br/>students, parents and/or citizens unless the following procedures have been followed:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any students, parent or citizen complaint about a teacher shall be reported to the<br/>teacher by the administrator receiving the complaint, within ten (10) days of receipt,<br/>if the complaint may be used against the teacher.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the involved teacher or administrator believe allegations in the complaint<br/>warrant a meeting, a meeting shall be scheduled during the teacher workday. If the<br/>complainant refuses to attend the meeting, the complaint shall be considered<br/>withdrawn.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is not resolved at the meeting to the satisfaction of the complainant,<br/>he/she shall put the complaint in writing and submit copies to the teacher and the<br/>immediate supervisor. The teacher shall be given time during the work day, without<br/>salary deduction, to review the complaint. <sup>45</sup></p>
<p>45</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>4. If the teacher believes the complaint is false, a grievance may be initiated to<br/>determine the validity of such complaint. If no written complaint is received, the<br/>matter shall be dropped.</p>
<p>5. Complaints which are withdrawn, or shown to be false, or are not sustained by the<br/>grievance procedure shall neither be placed in the teacher’s personnel file nor<br/>utilized in any evaluation or disciplinary action against the teacher.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained in these evaluation procedures shall be construed as prohibiting the<br/>District from giving employees other forms of feedback, suggestions, or direction regarding<br/>the performance of their duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;designee&quot; in &quot;principal/designee&quot; as used in this Article shall mean a certified<br/>employee of the District.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of five (5) years, a teacher may request to have derogatory or negative<br/>information/contents (other than evaluations) removed from his/her personnel file.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselors</p>
<p>Beginning in the 2009-2010 school year, the District and NTA will enlist the help of three</p>
<p>(3) counselors and administration to design an evaluation that matches counselor<br/>standards.</p>

<p>ARTICLE X<br/>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the District's goal for grades TK-6 schools and TK-8 schools:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as California's Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) is in effect:</p>

<p>Definitions</p>
<p>ARTICLE XI<br/>TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer - The movement of a unit member from one work location to another work<br/>location at a different work site.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassignment - The movement of a unit member from one subject area to another<br/>subject area or one grade level to another grade level at the same work location.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Displaced Teacher - A teacher that has to change assignments because of a<br/>reduction in positions at his/her grade level and site.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surplused Teacher - A teacher becomes surplused when he/she has the lowest<br/>district seniority at his/her site and a position needs to be eliminated at his/her site.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Position - Any bargaining unit position that is added to a site or District. A<br/>change in a class that adds specific curriculum i.e., GATE, PIE, Bridge, or ALA does<br/>not constitute a new position. Whenever specific curriculum i.e., GATE, PIE, ALA,<br/>Bridge is added to classes at a site, the principal will meet with all teachers at the<br/>affected grade level to determine who is willing to teach this curriculum. If no<br/>decision can be made or if more than one teacher is interested in the teaching<br/>assignment, district seniority will be used as the final deciding factor. If no teacher<br/>at that grade level accepts the assignment, then the collapse/T&amp;R process will<br/>come into play. It is agreed that positions that were filled in the 2008-2009 school<br/>year remain with the current teachers who are in those positions if they indicate that<br/>choice on their 2009 transfer &amp; reassignment form.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Position - A currently filled position becomes open when it is vacated. A half¬<br/>time opening will be created when one of the partners on a shared contract leaves<br/>the team and as long as the other partner chooses to remain half time. If the<br/>remaining partner chooses to return to full-time status then the full-time position will<br/>be posted as open.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District Wide Seniority - The unit members initial date of employment in the District<br/>with the provisions outlined in Section E of this article.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly Created Position - A position for which no previous job description has<br/>existed.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looping - Is an agreement between two consecutive grade level teachers (at the<br/>same site) which allows those teachers to rotate assignments each year, thus<br/>allowing them to teach the same students for two years.</p>
<p>B. Voluntary Transfers/Reassignments</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary transfer requests will be determined by the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-wide seniority</p>

<p>If a vacancy is not filled by the most senior applicant(s) who possesses the<br/>proper credential(s), English Learner or other certifications, the District must<br/>provide in writing to the bargaining unit member and the Association President<br/>the reason seniority was not the determining factor used to fill a vacancy. Any<br/>bargaining unit members) so notified will be granted, upon request, a meeting<br/>with the Superintendent or administrative designee to discuss the reasons for<br/>denial.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the secondary level, after the master schedule has been developed, a bargaining</p>

The form must be completed by all<br/>bargaining unit members. After March 1st, the District shall issue lists of known<br/>vacancies as they occur, which shall be posted at each school on the faculty<br/>bulletin board, district website, in the Education Center, and on the job line.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than March 15th all bargaining unit members shall submit to the District<br/>Human Resources Department the Voluntary Transfer/Reassignment<br/>Preference Form listing all school, grade level, and/or subject level preferences<br/>for voluntary transfer/reassignment.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or administrative designee, with site principals, will make<br/>all decisions on voluntary transfers/reassignmentsfrom the information provided<br/>on the Voluntary Transfer/Reassignment Preference Form, based on the criteria<br/>of B.1. Interviews will be arranged as necessary.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings will be arranged so that unit members can meet the new site<br/>administrators.</p>

These positions will be posted as vacancies during the<br/>following year. A current teacher can be transferred after June 30, if the District<br/>thinks that it is in the students’ best interest.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, any teacher who either moves voluntarily or involuntarily to a position<br/>after June 30th, that teacher will have that assignment for the purposes of<br/>transfer and reassignment the following year.</p>

<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positions posted before June 30 of each year, will not be considered for<br/>reposting the following year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a combination class is changed to two regular classes, the combination class<br/>teacher will have a choice of either grade levels that were in his/her combination<br/>class.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a combination class is eliminated, the person to be displaced will be the<br/>teacher with the least amount of district seniority at the two affected grade levels.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a program is transferred from one site to another site, the teacher transfers<br/>with the program, or requests transfer to another open position.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looping, as stated in the definition, can be initiated by two teachers currently<br/>assigned to two consecutive grade levels at the same site. These teachers will<br/>submit a written looping agreement to their site principal, subject to that principal’s<br/>approval. When the looping agreement ends, these teachers may renew the<br/>looping agreement or return to their original teaching assignments, provided those<br/>assignments still exist at that school site. This written agreement will include the<br/>duration of the looping agreement and the proposed grade level assignment for<br/>each teacher at the conclusion of the looping period. <sup>53</sup></p>
<p>53</p>
<p>July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016</p>
<p>C. Reassignment Grades 6 -12</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal will notify staff of pending grade level assignments during the open<br/>transfer and reassignment period, as the openings become known. At that time,<br/>any unit member shall have the right to request a reassignment in writing to the site<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection for reassignment shall be determined by the following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-wide seniority.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualifications of the unit member for the vacancy in terms of credential(s),<br/>experience in the field, and English Learner certification, if required.</p>

<p>Certificated Evaluation System</p>
<p>Tenured Teachers</p>
<p>June 2000</p>
<p>Revised June 2001<br/>Revised February 2002</p>
<p>Certificated Evaluation Committee Report</p>
<p>Enhancing Student Learning by Improving Teacher Performance</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Natomas Unified School District Certificated Evaluation Committee composed of a<br/>team of teachers, administrators and community members has developed the proposed evaluation<br/>procedures. The Committee was convened for the purpose of reviewing, revising, and<br/>recommending changes in the Evaluation Procedures described in Article IX of the NTA and<br/>NUSD Agreement. The Committee met on October 6, 19, November 2, and in January to<br/>develop the revised evaluation system and forms to use during the process. Subcommittees met<br/>through May 2000 to continue the editing process.</p>
<p>The six California Standards for the Teaching Profession, with minor modifications, are<br/>the basic framework for the proposed evaluation process. The District Continuum of Teaching<br/>Performance provides a clear and objective approach to assessing the teacher’s performance by<br/>describing specific elements for each standard. The continua are organized to describe the four<br/>levels of development towards meeting the District Professional Teaching Standards:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice is inconsistent with standards</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing practice toward standards</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying practice consistently with standards</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accomplished practice that exemplifies standards</p>
<p>Each level has descriptions to indicate what a teacher should know and be able to do according to<br/>the specific elements of the Professional Teaching Standards.</p>
<p>The Committee is recommending that the agreed on evaluation procedures and forms be<br/>instituted during the 2000-2001 school year. The Committee will reconvene in September 2001<br/>to review problems and suggestions for modifications of the certificated evaluation procedures.</p>
<p>In August 2000, all District administrators will participate in training for the implementation of<br/>the new, certificated evaluation procedures/process.</p>
<p>. The Committee acknowledges and appreciates the following districts for their<br/>contributions to helping us develop Natomas’s Certificated Evaluation Procedures: Capristrano<br/>Unified School District, Milpitas Unified School District, Mt. Diablo Unified School District,<br/>Palo Alto Unified School District, Roseville Joint Union High School District, Sylvan Union<br/>School District, and San Juan Unified School District. Other references used included California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession, California Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the<br/>California Department of Education Descriptions of Practice.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Philosophy of Evaluation</p>
<p>The Evaluation Process is a collaborative endeavor between teachers and administrators<br/>designed to promote goal setting and self-reflection in order to facilitate professional growth,<br/>improvement and risk taking in innovative teaching practices. Effective, meaningful teacher<br/>evaluation enhances student learning and recognizes excellence in teaching. Evaluation must be<br/>acknowledged as a continual process to encourage life long learning, promote professional<br/>growth and foster student academic success.</p>
<p>Goal of Evaluation</p>
<p>The goal of evaluation should be to provide the teacher with feedback on performance<br/>that will stimulate reflective thought, improve performance and provide professional<br/>development.</p>
<p>Purpose of Evaluation</p>
<p>Effective evaluation practices should:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognize and reinforce effective teaching</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide for the improvement of student achievement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assess adherence to professional teaching standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide constructive feedback to educators</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide evidence that will serve as the basis for terminating incompetent or<br/>unproductive personnel</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist in continuing professional development for teachers</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unify teachers and administrators in their collective efforts to educate students</p>
<p>Evaluation Process and Use of Professional Teaching Standards</p>
<p>The use of Professional Teaching Standards in the formal observation and evaluation<br/>process will promote the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and organizing subject matter for student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisting educators with continuing professional development</p>

<p>Certificated Evaluation Committee Report</p>
<p>Enhancing Student Learning by Improving Teacher Performance</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Natomas Unified School District Certificated Evaluation Committee composed of a<br/>team of teachers, administrators and community members has developed the proposed evaluation<br/>procedures. The Committee was convened for the purpose of reviewing, revising, and<br/>recommending changes in the Evaluation Procedures described in Article DC of the NTA and<br/>NUSD Agreement. The Committee met on October 6, 19, November 2, and in January to<br/>develop the revised evaluation system and forms to use during the process. Subcommittees met<br/>through May 2000 to continue the editing process.</p>
<p>The six California Standards for the Teaching Profession, with minor modifications, are<br/>the basic framework for the proposed evaluation process. The District Continuum of Teaching<br/>Performance provides a clear and objective approach to assessing the teacher’s performance by<br/>describing specific elements for each standard. The continua are organized to describe the four<br/>levels of development towards meeting the District Professional Teaching Standards:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice is inconsistent with standards</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing practice toward standards</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying practice consistently with standards</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accomplished practice that exemplifies standards</p>
<p>Each level has descriptions to indicate what a teacher should know and be able to do according to<br/>the specific elements of the Professional Teaching Standards.</p>
<p>The Committee is recommending that the agreed on evaluation procedures and forms be<br/>instituted during the 2000-2001 school year. The Committee will reconvene in September 2001<br/>to review problems and suggestions for modifications of the certificated evaluation procedures.</p>
<p>In August 2000, all District administrators will participate in training for the implementation of<br/>the new. certificated evaluation procedures/'process.</p>
<p>The Committee acknowledges and appreciates the following districts for their<br/>contributions to helping us develop Natomas’s Certificated Evaluation Procedures: Capnstrano<br/>Unified School District, Milpitas Unified School District, Mt. Diablo Unified School District,<br/>Palo Alto Unified School District, Roseville Joint Union High School District, Sylvan Union<br/>School District, and San Juan Unified School District. Other references used included California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession, California Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the<br/>California Department of Education Descriptions of Practice.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Philosophy of Evaluation</p>
<p>The Evaluation Process is a collaborative endeavor between teachers and administrators<br/>designed to promote goal setting and self-reflection in order to facilitate professional growth,<br/>improvement and risk taking in innovative teaching practices. Effective, meaningful teacher<br/>evaluation enhances student learning and recognizes excellence in teaching. Evaluation must be<br/>acknowledged as a continual process to encourage life long learning, promote professional<br/>growth and foster student academic success.</p>
<p>Goal of Evaluation</p>
<p>The goal of evaluation should be to provide the teacher with feedback on performance<br/>that will stimulate reflective thought, improve performance and provide professional<br/>development.</p>
<p>Purpose of Evaluation</p>
<p>Effective evaluation practices should:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognize and reinforce effective teaching</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide for the improvement of student achievement</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assess adherence to professional teaching standards</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide constructive feedback to educators</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide evidence that will serve as the basis for terminating incompetent or<br/>unproductive personnel</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist in continuing professional development for teachers</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unify teachers and administrators in their collective efforts to educate students</p>
<p>Evaluation Process and Use of Professional Teaching Standards</p>
<p>The use of Professional Teaching Standards in the formal observation and evaluation<br/>process will promote the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engaging and supporting all students in learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding and organizing subject matter for student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all students</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing student learning</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisting educators with continuing professional development</p>
