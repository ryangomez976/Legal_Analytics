<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee who is assigned to work less than the full time workday of work year shall</p>
<p>receive a salary based on the ratio of assigned hours or assigned days to the number of<br/>hours in a regular workday or number of days in a regular work year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;payments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be made no later than the last day of each month on which the</p>
<p>District office is open for business.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjustments to the Salary Schedule</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2013-14 school year, the certificated salary schedule will be increased by two (2) percent<br/>retroactive to July 1, 2013 (Refer to Appendix A. 1.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2014-15 school year, the certificated salary schedule will be revised (1) by<br/>removing years 15, 19, and 23, and therefore ending with year 29, and (2) by providing<br/>an increase to each anniversary step. (Refer to Appendix A.2.)</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an employee is employed initially by the District, the employee's transcripts will be<br/>evaluated to determine which upper division and graduate courses completed, if any, in addition to<br/>those required for a bachelor's degree, will be accepted for placement on the Certificated Salary<br/>Schedule.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement on the first step of Column 1 is based on completion of a bachelor's degree<br/>from an accredited college or university, on creditable years of teaching experience, and<br/>possession of a valid California teaching credential.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units and degrees will be accepted only from accredited colleges and universities.<br/>Accredited colleges and universities are defined for purposes of this Article and<br/>Appendix A as those from which units are accepted by the California Commission for<br/>Teacher Preparation and Licensing.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum number of units that will be accepted and credited for initial</p>
<p>placement of a teacher who does not have a master's degree is 15 units (Column<br/>2). The initial placement of a teacher who has a master's degree is limited to<br/>Column 3.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum of five years of prior teaching experience shall be granted for teachers<br/>entering the District for the first time.</p>
<p>a. A minimum of 75% of the teaching days of the year must be completed for one<br/>year of credit.</p>
<p>Units Credited for Salary Advancement</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those college or university units of credit that an employee wishes to utilize for purposes of<br/>advancement on the Certificated Salary Schedule shall be credited subject to the following<br/>conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An official transcript of courses completed or a statement with the official stamp of the<br/>college or university signed by the registrar of the college or university that the course<br/>has been satisfactorily completed will be required no later than the last workday before<br/>October 1, to be applicable for salary schedule placement purposes for that school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units are defined for the purposes of this Article and Appendix A as semester units. All<br/>units must be in upper division or graduate level course work. Units taken to clear a<br/>preliminary or emergency credential shall not be eligible to be counted towards column<br/>advancement. Units that are earned as quarter units or trimester units shall be converted</p>
<p>to the appropriate number of semester units.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of each unit of approved college credit is required to earn credit</p>
<p>toward advancement from one salary column to another. Courses to be credited for<br/>advancement on the salary schedule must be approved by the Superintendent or designee<br/>first and then taken to the Governing Board for approval prior to commencement of the<br/>course. Under extenuating circumstances, an employee may request approval for a<br/>course after the course has begun. The Superintendent may, but is not required to, grant<br/>approval for the course. Approval shall not be withheld for arbitrary or capricious<br/>reasons.</p>
<p>a. In order to be approved, each unit of college or university credit must:</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Relate to the employee's current teaching assignment;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a part of a program leading toward an advanced degree in a field<br/>related to the employee's teaching assignment or a field in which the<br/>employee is credentialed to teach within the District; or</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a part of a program leading toward an additional education services<br/>credential.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may enroll in no more than six semester units or two classes that<br/>exceed six semester units or the equivalent per semester while school is in<br/>session. The limit does not apply to the summer recess period.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee takes a course for which salary credit is not allowed pursuant to<br/>paragraph E.3.a of this Article, and if within two years of taking the course the<br/>employee is reassigned to teach in the area of the course taken, the District shall<br/>reevaluate the course for salary credit based upon the criteria of this paragraph.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column movement is calculated and credited to certificated employees in the September<br/>paycheck each year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verification of units to be credited towards column advancement must be received by the<br/>District no later than October 1 in order to receive column advancement for that school<br/>year. Any verification received after October 1 shall count towards credit for column<br/>movement for the following year. (For example, in order to advance from column 1 to<br/>column 2 for the 1999-2000 school year, verification of completion of applicable units<br/>must be received no later than October 1, 1999.)</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to receive credit toward column advancement, a certificated employee must<br/>inform the District of his or her intent no later than April 1 of the previous school year.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the contract and salary schedule to provide the following justifications for</p>
<p>column advancement.</p>
<p>Column 1 - BA and valid credential</p>
<p>Column 2 - BA and valid credential and 15 additional semester units<br/>Column 3 - BA and valid credential and MA<br/>Column 4 - BA and valid credential and MA and 15 additional units<br/>Column 5 - BA and valid credential and MA and 30 additional units</p>
<p>* additional units must be taken after MA is obtained</p>
<p>Certificated teachers may take up to 15.0 board of trustee approved semester units that are not part of a<br/>masters program, taken prior to the entry of a masters program, and apply those units to the salary schedule<br/>one year after the employee is placed on the masters column</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exception specified below, a certificated employee may move no more than one</p>
<p>column per year. Where an employee completes units that would justify placement on a<br/>subsequent (or additional) column, such units shall be credited towards future movement<br/>at the rate of one column per year.</p>
<p>Exception: A certificated employee who receives his/her Masters degree and becomes eligible to move<br/>from column 1 to column 3 in one move and:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that employee has fully complied with the District specifications regarding</p>
<p>approved courses and course load and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee has properly applied for such advancement by complying with the</p>
<p>terms of this article;</p>
<p>Such employee will be permitted to advance from column 1 to column 3.</p>
<p>9. Beginning with employees hired July 1, 2000 and thereafter, a master's degree from an<br/>accredited university will be recognized for compensation only if such degree is in an<br/>educational field that is directly related to the instruction of students. Employees who<br/>already hold a recognized degree, have received prior approval to pursue a specific<br/>degree, or were employed before July 1, 2000, are exempt from this provision.</p>
<p>Payroll Deductions</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon appropriate written authorization from an employee, the District agrees to deduct from the<br/>employee's salary such deductions as, but not limited to, annual dues for the Exclusive<br/>Representative, approved tax-sheltered annuities, credit unions, savings bonds, charitable<br/>donations, as well as any other plans or programs approved by the District.</p>
<p>Certificated employees who participate in voluntary trainings paid for by the District must sign a<br/>“Reimbursement for Training Expenses” agreement. If the Employee voluntarily leaves the District, he or<br/>she must repay the expense for the training pursuant to the following schedule. After working for:</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District’s base monthly contribution shall continue not to exceed $753.60.</p>
<p>1. During open enrollment for the 2013-14 plan year, eligible represented employees shall be<br/>allowed to “opt out” of the health and welfare program and, in so doing, be exempt from paying<br/>any premium contributions. With the closing of open enrollment and implemented with the new<br/>plan year, the aggregate amount of the District contributions toward premiums (the annual cap of<br/>$7,536) that would have been made for the opt outs shall be prorated to a per employee (using the<br/>number of employees actually enrolled in the program) amount and used to increase the District’s<br/>per employee benefit contribution cap for the 2013-14 plan year, reducing the individual</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>employee out of pocket contribution toward premium for those actually participating in the<br/>program for the 2013-14 plan year. All unused prorated funds shall be set aside and applied to<br/>premium contributions in the following year.</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2014, the District’s base monthly contribution shall not exceed $803.60.</p>
<p>1. During open enrollment for the 2014-15 plan year, eligible represented employees shall be</p>
<p>allowed to “opt out” of the health and welfare program and, in so doing, be exempt from paying<br/>any premium contributions. With the closing of open enrollment and implemented with the new<br/>plan year, the aggregate amount of the District contributions toward premiums (the annual cap of<br/>$8,036) that would have been made for the opt outs shall be prorated to a per employee (using the<br/>number of employees actually enrolled in the program) amount and used to increase the District’s<br/>per employee benefit contribution cap for the 2014-15 plan year, reducing the individual<br/>employee out of pocket contribution toward premium for those actually participating in the<br/>program for the 2014-15 plan year. All unused prorated funds shall be set aside and applied to<br/>premium contributions in the following year.</p>
<p>Part-time Employment</p>
<p>C. For an employee whose assigned workday or work year is less than the normal workday or work<br/>year, the District's contribution for the health and welfare benefits set forth in paragraphs A. 1<br/>through A.4 of this Article shall be prorated based on the ration of assigned student contact hours<br/>or assigned days to the number of student contact hours in a regular workday or number of days in<br/>a regular work year. An employee must be assigned to work 50% of a regular workday to be<br/>eligible for Health and Welfare Benefits.</p>
<p>In-Lieu Contributions</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No in-lieu payments or contributions to programs other than those which the District provides<br/>above shall be made by the District for any employees who elect not to subscribe to the benefits<br/>provided by this Article.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An IRC 125 plan will be implemented through SISC as soon as practicable during the 2006/07<br/>school year at no cost to the District or its employees.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties will form an insurance committee to explore health care plan options, including plan<br/>design, administration, cost and benefits. The intent of the parties is to conduct a review and<br/>make recommendations regarding insurance coverage prior to the beginning of the 2007/08 school<br/>year.</p>
<p>In-Lieu Savings</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savings in District contributions for premiums that fall below the District cap will be shared<br/>equally by the employee and the District.</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI<br/>LEAVES OF ABSENCE</p>
<p>Sick Leave</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>A.</p>
<p>A full-time employee shall be entitled to 10 days of sick leave for each year of employment.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may use accumulated sick leave at any time during the school year for<br/>accident, illness, or quarantine. Unused sick leave shall accrue from school year to<br/>school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave shall be charged on the basis of the time out of the workday in increments of<br/>one-half day.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees must contact the District as soon as the need to be absent is known.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the employee informs the District that the absence will be greater than<br/>one day, the employee should attempt to notify the District of an intention to<br/>return to work before the employee's substitute is dismissed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave also may be taken for necessary medical examinations or treatments that<br/>cannot be scheduled outside of regular work hours.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a verification of illness following any utilization of sick leave<br/>after the fifth consecutive day.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female employees shall be entitled to utilize sick leave for the period of time required to<br/>be absent due to pregnancy or childbirth.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of leave, including the date upon which the leave shall begin, shall<br/>be determined by the employee and her doctor based solely on the employee's<br/>physical ability to render service to the District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement from the employee's doctor as to the beginning date of the leave<br/>shall be filed with the Superintendent.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of the employee's return to service shall be based upon her doctor's<br/>analysis and written verification of the bargaining unit member's physical ability<br/>to render service to the District.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time, if the District has just cause to believe that an employee has abused the<br/>utilization of any days of sick leave, the District may, upon written notice, following a<br/>verbal warning, require the employee to provide an acceptable written verification from a<br/>physician or practitioner.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each school year, when an employee has exhausted all available sick leave,<br/>including all accumulated sick leave, and continues to be absent from his or her duties on<br/>account of illness or accident for an additional period of up to five (5) months, whether<br/>or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the employee’s employment, the<br/>amount deducted from the salary due the employee for any of the additional five months<br/>in which the absence occurs shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a substitute<br/>employee employed to fill the employee’s position during the employee’s absence or, if<br/>no substitute employee was employed, the amount that would have been paid to the<br/>substitute had he or she been employed. The District will make every reasonable effort<br/>to secure the services of a substitute employee.</p>
<p>For purposes of this provision:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave, including accumulated sick leave and the five (5) month period</p>
<p>shall run consecutively.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not be provided more than one (1) five (5)-month period per</p>
<p>illness or accident. However, if a school year terminates before the five (5)-<br/>month period is exhausted, the employee may take the balance of the five (5)-<br/>month period in the subsequent school year.</p>
<p>Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>B. An employee may request to utilize up to seven days of the days of sick leave allowed pursuant to</p>
<p>this Article in cases of personal necessity.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessity leave shall be granted for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a member of the immediate family.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accident involving the person or property of a member of the immediate family.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, personal necessity leave may be granted for that portion of a workday to cover<br/>emergency occasions that may be unavoidable, or of a serious nature involving<br/>circumstances which the employee cannot be expected to disregard, and which may not<br/>be conducted at a time other than during regular work hours.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request up to two days for personal business without setting</p>
<p>forth the nature of the specific reason(s) involved. However, these two days may<br/>not be used to extend a district holiday, to include the beginning and end of the<br/>school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee shall make a written request for leave at least three days in advance of the<br/>day on which the leave is intended to be taken, unless the necessity involved is of such a<br/>character as to make it impossible to make such request three days in advance, in which<br/>case the request shall be made as much in advance as possible.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Advance approval shall not be required for the matters set forth in paragraphs<br/>B. 1 .a-b of this Article.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for such leave shall be on the form specified by the District, dated<br/>and signed by the employee, and shall set forth the nature of the personal<br/>necessity involved (excluding requests pursuant to paragraph B.2.a of this<br/>Article).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent/Principal shall grant or deny a personal necessity leave<br/>request based upon the application. Personal necessity leave requests as<br/>provided in paragraphs B. 1 .a-b and B.2.a of this Article shall be granted.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time off shall be charged to the employee on the same basis as sick leave.</p>
<p>Bereavement Leave</p>
<p>C. An employee shall be entitled to three days of paid leave of absence, or five days if travel out of<br/>state is required, due to the death of any member of the employee's immediate family.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>This leave shall not be deducted from sick leave.</p>
<p>Jury Duty Leave</p>
<p>D. The District shall grant leave of absence with pay for required jury duty.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any fees paid for jury duty (excluding mileage and/or expenses reimbursed by the court)<br/>shall be signed over to the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is called for jury duty shall notify the principal immediately upon<br/>receipt of the jury summons.</p>
<p>Industrial Accident and Illness Leave</p>
<p>E. An employee shall be entitled to industrial accident or illness leave for any job-related accident or<br/>illness in the amount of up to 60 days during which the schools of the District are required to be in<br/>session or when the employee would otherwise have been performing work for the District in any<br/>one fiscal year for the same accident.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such benefits shall be in addition to other sick leave benefits provided by the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entitlement to this leave has been exhausted, other sick leave shall be utilized.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees will report all job-related injuries and illnesses to the District within 24 hours<br/>of the occurrence regardless of whether or not medical attention is required or whether or<br/>not time is lost from work. In the event that the employee's injury or illness prevents</p>
<p>the filing of the report within the time limit, the report shall be filed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an industrial accident or illness leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the<br/>employee shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due for the same illness or</p>
<p>injury.</p>
<p>General Leave</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may apply for a leave of absence on an unpaid basis. Except under extenuating<br/>circumstances, the employee shall apply for such leaves of absence in writing prior to May 1<sup>st</sup> of<br/>the preceding leave or November 15 preceding a second semester leave. The District may, at its<br/>discretion, grant an unpaid leave to an employee.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves shall be granted for a period of up to 12 calendar months per request.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who is granted a leave of absence shall notify the District by March 1 of<br/>his/her intent to return to work for the next school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the leave is granted for a period of less than five days, there will be no payroll<br/>deduction for health and welfare benefit payments.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each request for general leave of absence will be considered on the individual<br/>merits of each request and NOT on prior approvals or past practice.</p>
<p>Provisions for Salary and Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee on a paid leave of absence shall receive his or her regular salary for the duration of<br/>the leave of absence. In addition, the employee shall maintain his or her eligibility for the health<br/>and welfare benefit contributions set forth in paragraphs A. 1 through A.4 or paragraph D of<br/>Article V of this Agreement, whichever applies.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been granted an unpaid leave of absence may, as long as the</p>
<p>practice is allowed by the insurance provider(s), maintain eligibility for health and<br/>welfare benefits by paying to the District, on a schedule established by the District, the<br/>amount of money equal to the required District contribution for the fringe benefits for the<br/>period of the leave.</p>
<p>Verification of Ability to Return to Work</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee absent under the provisions of paragraphs relating to sick leave, extended illness, or<br/>industrial accident leave for 10 or more consecutive days shall be required to provide a physician's<br/>verification of ability to return to work and render service to the District prior to returning to work.</p>
<p>Return to Position</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employee&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from an unpaid leave of absence there is a promise of a position within</p>
<p>the District at the same FTE as the employee held before prior to the leave. There is no guarantee<br/>that the employee will be reinstated at the same position vacated.</p>
<p>Immediate Family Defined</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this Article, immediate family shall be defined as: mother, father, step-parent,<br/>guardian, grandmother, grandfather, or grandchild of the employee or the spouse of the employee,<br/>and the spouse, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, stepson,<br/>stepdaughter, sister, sister-in-law, stepbrother, or stepsister of the employee, or any relative of the<br/>employee living in the immediate household of the employee</p>
<p>General Policies Governing Leaves</p>
<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No employee may utilize or receive any leave of absence when the employee engages in any<br/>concerted activity as defined in Article I, paragraph C, of this Agreement.</p>
<p>1. An employee who is absent at any time during which other employees, by their absence<br/>from work, are engaging in or have engaged in any concerted activity, shall not receive<br/>pay for the period of absence except upon furnishing verification acceptable to the<br/>District that the employee's absence was for a cause allowed by the terms of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>L. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except with written approval of the District, no employee shall be gainfully employed by any<br/>other employer while on paid leave of absence status from employment with the District.</p>
<p>1. Violation of this provision shall be grounds for withholding leave benefits and may<br/>subject the employee to disciplinary action pursuant to California Government Code<br/>Section 44944.</p>
<p>M. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article shall be considered to be the policy of the Board of Trustees, and these provisions<br/>constitute Board policy on leaves of any duration for any accident, illness, or any other reason.</p>
<p>No employee may utilize or be granted any leave of absence except for the exact causes and<br/>pursuant to the specific procedures set forth in this Article.</p>
<p>Family and Medical Leave</p>
<p>N. Pursuant to state and federal law, the District will provide family and medical care leave for</p>
<p>eligible unit members. The following provisions set forth unit members' rights and obligations<br/>with respect to such leave. Rights and obligations which are not specifically set forth below are<br/>set forth in the Department of Labor regulations implementing the Federal Family and Medical</p>
<p>Leave Act of 1993 (&quot;FMLA&quot;), and the regulations of the California Fair Employment and Housing<br/>Commission implementing the California Family Rights Act (&quot;CFRA&quot;) (Government Code<br/>Section 12945.2). Unless otherwise provided, &quot;Leave&quot; under this section shall mean leave<br/>pursuant to the FMLA and CFRA.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any period an employee takes unpaid family care and medical leave, the District<br/>shall maintain and pay for coverage for health benefits pursuant to the conditions of<br/>Article V of this Agreement to the extent required by the FMLA and CFRA.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible members are entitled to a total of twelve (12) workweeks of leave during any<br/>twelve (12)-month period. A member's entitlement to leave for the birth or placement of<br/>a child for adoption or foster care expires twelve (12) months after the birth or placement.</p>
<p>The twelve (12)-month period for calculating leave entitlement will be a rolling period measured<br/>backward from the date leave is taken and continues with each additional leave day taken. Thus,<br/>whenever a member requests leave, the District will look back over the previous twelve (12)-<br/>month period to determine how much leave has been used in determining how much leave a<br/>member is entitled to.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right to Family Care and Medical Leave shall be in addition to any other leave to<br/>which employees are entitled under this Agreement. If a member uses the leave under<br/>this section for any reason permitted under the law, he/she must exhaust all other accrued<br/>leaves (including sick leave to the extent set forth below) in connection with the leave.</p>
<p>If an employee requests leave for his/her own serious health condition, or the serious health<br/>condition of his/her spouse, parent, child or domestic partner, the employee must exhaust available<br/>sick leave concurrently with the utilization of Family Care and Medical Leave.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the termination of the leave, an employee shall have a right to reinstatement in the<br/>same position he/she occupied prior to the leave provided the employee is absent no<br/>longer than twelve (12) weeks.</p>
<p>Catastrophic Leave Program</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in the program shall be voluntary.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a case-by-case basis an employee of the District may donate up to five (5) days of<br/>accumulated sick leave under the circumstances stated in the following paragraphs to<br/>another employee of the District who has suffered a long-term, non-industrial<br/>catastrophic illness or injury and who has completely exhausted all available paid leaves,<br/>including regular and extended sick leave.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify for Catastrophic Leave, the employee of the District must have suffered an<br/>illness or injury that is expected to incapacitate the employee of the District for an<br/>extended period of time, or that incapacitates a member of the employee of the District’s<br/>family, that requires the employee of the District to take time off from work for an<br/>extended period of time, and taking extended time off work creates a financial hardship<br/>for the employee of the District because the employee of the District has exhausted all<br/>applicable leaves and other time off including but not limited to sick leave, statutory<br/>leave, vacation and comp time.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donating employee of the District must, after the donation, retain a minimum of one<br/>year’s worth of accrued, unused sick leave from prior accumulations.</p>

<table border="1">

<p>ARTICLE VHI<br/>PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>Evaluations of certificated staff shall be processed in compliance with the agreed upon procedures, forms,<br/>schedules and timelines as contained in this article.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each school year, employees shall be provided with the Guidelines<br/>for Professional Evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than October 1 of each school year, information from the goal setting shall be<br/>compiled by each employee new to the District and the Superintendent or designee. The<br/>Director of Special Education (or designee in the event of the temporary absence of the<br/>Director of Special Education) evaluates Special Education employees.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By November 15th, each faculty member shall have a goals conference during which<br/>both the faculty member and the supervisor work together to identify areas of strength<br/>and areas of growth. Mutual goals and/or one party goals shall be identified and recorded<br/>in performance evaluation terms. In addition, methods for achieving goals and methods<br/>for evaluating achievement may be discussed and indicated. In instances where returning<br/>employees have goals from the previous year’s evaluation, a conference is not required<br/>unless requested by either the supervisor or the faculty member. In the event that a<br/>faculty member does not agree with a goal or goals set by this process, he or she may file<br/>a written statement regarding that goal or goals and have it attached to the document<br/>reflecting goals.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first formal observation and interim evaluation for probationary faculty shall be</p>
<p>completed by December 1 of each year of probation. The second formal observation<br/>shall be completed by March 1 of each year of probation. The final evaluation will be<br/>completed by May 7 of each year of probation. Each observation will be followed by a<br/>post-observation conference within fifteen (15) working days of the observation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, permanent faculty members shall be evaluated once every two years.<br/>Permanent faculty who have been with the District for at least ten years, whose last<br/>evaluation met standards, may be evaluated every five years. Permanent faculty members<br/>shall be formally observed at least once during their evaluation year. These observations<br/>shall occur no later than 45 days prior to the last instructional day.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation and assessment of certificated employees shall be based on employee</p>
<p>competency as it relates to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP<br/>2009).</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that upon passage of any legislation which might impact district<br/>revenue and which requires the parties to meet and negotiate, the parties will meet<br/>immediately and set a negotiations timeline which will exhaust the process prior to any<br/>deadline which might cause a penalty for the District.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer evaluation and self-evaluation, except where a portfolio self-evaluation is used by<br/>mutual agreement of the employee and the evaluator shall not be used in this process<br/>except where required by law. If agreement between the evaluator and the employee is<br/>not reached, the portfolio self-evaluation will not be used.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an employee is in disagreement with a portion of the evaluation, he/she may submit a<br/>written statement, which shall be attached to the evaluation in the personnel file.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from the employee to facilitate evaluations shall be secured through a number of<br/>procedures that may include, but are not limited to, observations, products, judgments,<br/>responsibilities carried, teacher-developed tests and anecdotal records. Hearsay of a<br/>derogatory nature may not be used in evaluations unless and until a thorough<br/>investigation is held to determine the validity of the information. A faculty member<br/>who:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has derogatory hearsay included within his/her evaluation, and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believes the District has not conducted a fair and thorough investigation</p>
<p>has the right to file a grievance through to binding mediation-arbitration to determine<br/>whether or not a fair and thorough investigation was conducted prior to inclusion of such<br/>material in his/her evaluation. In the event that the mediator-arbitrator determines that a<br/>fair and thorough investigation was not conducted, only the material that was the subject<br/>of the grievance must be deleted from the evaluation. The redacted evaluation may then<br/>be placed in the personnel file.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written evaluations and the summary assessment report of certificated employees shall<br/>include descriptions of unsatisfactory performance, if any, with specific<br/>recommendations for means of improvement and suggestions of available sources of<br/>assistance. Recommendations may include the requirement that the employees<br/>participate in an in-service training program to improve teaching methods and/or<br/>instructional competency. An employee will be compensated for attendance at, and<br/>participation in, any workshop the employee is required to attend as part of an<br/>improvement plan. Such compensation will include per diem reimbursement (or pro-rata<br/>per diem where appropriate) for attendance outside or and in addition to regular work<br/>hours.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation checklist and final evaluation form, as jointly developed by the District<br/>and Association, shall be included as Appendices B to this Agreement.</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains the responsibilities for evaluation and assessment of performance of<br/>each employee. Any grievance shall be limited to a claim that procedural requirements<br/>have not been met.</p>
<p>8.14 If there is more than one evaluator, the employee may request whom the employee would<br/>like to have as evaluator.</p>

<p>(10) days after receiving the grievance. Either party may request a personal conference<br/>within the above time limits. If a conference is held, the decision shall be tendered<br/>within 10 days following the conference. If the Principal/Superintendent or designee<br/>does not respond within the time limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>Level Two - Conciliation</p>
<p>K. In the event the grievance is denied or the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level One,<br/>either party may request that the grievance proceed to conciliation.

<p>appeal to level three.</p>

<p>1. The filing shall be made within 10 days of the Level Two denial.</p>
<p>a. If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance or if the District<br/>claims that a grievance should be dismissed because, for example, it falls<br/>outside the scope of the procedure, it was filed or processed in an untimely<br/>manner, or the dispute has become moot, such question shall be heard and ruled<br/>upon by the arbitrator prior to any hearing on the merits of the grievance.</p>
<p>1) If the District should choose to refuse to arbitrate a dispute, nothing in<br/>this section shall preclude the Association from seeking through<br/>appropriate administrative or judicial proceedings, to compel the<br/>District to proceed to arbitration.</p>
<p>2) Processing and discussing the merits of an asserted grievance shall not<br/>constitute a waiver by the District of a defense that the dispute is not<br/>grievable or is not timely filed provided that the defense is raised not<br/>later than the written decision at level 2.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall share the per diem and expense costs of the arbitrator and the AAA<br/>administration fee. Each party shall bear all other costs of its own case.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties may utilize the Expedited Arbitration Rules of the AAA by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitration shall be limited solely to the interpretation and application of this<br/>Agreement, to the precise issue(s) submitted in the original filing, and any procedural<br/>objections made by the respondent. The arbitration shall not determine any other<br/>issue(s).</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitrator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall have no power or authority to hear cases challenging the</p>
<p>District's promulgation of rules or procedures for the implementation of this<br/>Agreement, the discipline (except as provided by Article XII) or termination of<br/>an employee, or the failure to reemploy or reassign any employee to a position<br/>for which the employee is compensated over and above regular placement on the<br/>salary schedule.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitrator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall submit a written decision, including findings of fact,</p>
<p>reasoning, and conclusions on the precise issue(s) submitted. The arbitrator's<br/>decision shall be limited as follows:</p>
<p>1) Where the District has made a judgment involving the exercise of<br/>discretion, the arbitrator shall review such judgment solely to<br/>determine whether it violated the express terms of the Agreement. The<br/>arbitrator's judgment shall not be substituted for the judgment of the</p>
<p>District.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not add to, subtract from, amend, modify, or alter any<br/>provisions or procedures contained in this Agreement.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not issue statements of opinion or conclusions that are not<br/>essential to the determination of the issue(s) submitted.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitrator's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may include restitution, financial reimbursement, or other proper</p>
<p>remedy, except fines or penalties. The arbitrator shall have no power to grant a financial<br/>or remunerative award where no loss of money or wages has been proved, or to grant an<br/>award of restitution or reimbursement that is greater than the amount of money lost by<br/>the alleged improper application of this Agreement.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitrator's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be submitted to the Exclusive Representative and to the</p>
<p>District for review and implementation.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>No unit member shall be disciplined without just cause and, in appropriate cases, the utilization of<br/>progressive discipline. Except in emergencies, or as expressly authorized by law, suspensions<br/>without pay shall not be put in effect until the employee has received written notice advising<br/>him/her of the proposed action, the reasons(s) therefore, the facts giving rise thereto, the proposed</p>
<p>effective date, advising that the employee shall have access to written material that forms the basis<br/>for the proposed action, and until the employee shall have had the opportunity to respond to the<br/>Principal/Superintendent or Director of Special Education, orally or in writing by a date specified<br/>in such notice. If the proposed action or some modified action is then implemented, the employee<br/>may then appeal such action directly to binding arbitration under Article XI of this Agreement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grounds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspension&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the grounds set forth in the Education Code,</p>

<p>file) shall be grievable under Article XI of this Agreement but only through Level 2<br/>(Conciliation) of the grievance procedure. Discipline &quot;short&quot; of a letter of reprimand<br/>shall not be grievable.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XVII<br/>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Completion of Negotiations</p>
<p>A. This Agreement represents complete collective bargaining and full agreement by the parties with<br/>respect to the wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment which shall prevail<br/>during the term of this Agreement.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understood&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that as to all matters not covered by this Agreement there</p>
<p>shall be no duty to meet and negotiate further during the term of this Agreement unless<br/>the parties agree to negotiate on any subject. Should the Legislature add to the &quot;Scope of<br/>Representation&quot; set forth in Section 3543.2 of the Educational Employment Relations<br/>Act, either party may, upon notice to the other, propose the issue for negotiations.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory improvements in benefits set forth in this Agreement brought about<br/>by changes in state or federal laws shall be implemented by the District, and the<br/>Association shall be notified.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory reductions in benefits set forth in this Agreement brought about by<br/>changes in state or federal laws shall be implemented by the District, and the<br/>Association shall be notified.</p>
<p>2. Except by mutual agreement, the parties expressly waive and relinquish the right to meet<br/>and negotiate with respect to any subject or matter, even though such subject or matter<br/>may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either party at the time<br/>they met and negotiated on and executed this Agreement and even though such subjects<br/>or matters were proposed and later withdrawn.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agrees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it will not change any &quot;term and condition of</p>
<p>employment&quot; as defined in Section 3543.2 of the Act without first notifying the<br/>Association of such intended change.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclusive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a written demand to bargain the effect</p>
<p>of such a change within 10 days of written notice that the change is being made,<br/>or the right of the Association to meet and negotiate shall be waived.</p>
<p>Following the written demand, the District agrees to meet and negotiate.</p>
<p>Past Practice</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific provisions of this Agreement shall prevail over any past practice or procedure. In the<br/>absence of a specific provision of this Agreement, practices and procedures that have been at the<br/>District's discretion in the past remain within the discretion of the District as set forth in Article XI<br/>of this Agreement except as limited by applicable law.</p>
<p>1. When reference is made to statutes (e.g.. Education Code), such reference is</p>
<p>informational only and does not subject the provision of such statutes to the grievance</p>
<p>processes of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Severability and Savings</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that any portion of this Agreement is found to be unlawful by a court of competent<br/>jurisdiction, the rest of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;federal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state agency with jurisdiction invalidate any portion of this</p>
<p>Agreement, the parties shall, on appropriate notice, meet to negotiate over the affected<br/>provision(s).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Legislature repeals or modifies sections of the Education Code relative to matters<br/>within the scope of representation, the District agrees to negotiate the effect of such<br/>modifications prior to implementing the provisions of any change.</p>
<p>Duration/Reopeners</p>
<p>D. This Agreement shall be in full force and effect from the date of ratification by the parties up to<br/>and including June 30, 2015.</p>
