<p>Each certificated employee shall, in the event of death of a member of his<br/>or her immediate family, be entitled to a leave of absence for purposes of<br/>attending the funeral and/or attending the estate business, not to exceed<br/>five (5) working days if the deceased resided within California, and<br/>seven (7) working days if the deceased resided outside the State of<br/>California.</p>
<p>The Superintendent may extend the number of days of leave due to<br/>emergency situations. Members of the &quot;immediate family&quot; are defined as<br/>the mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, or a grandchild of the<br/>employee or of the spouse of the employee, and the spouse, son, son-in-<br/>law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother or sister, brother-in law, sister-<br/>in-law of the employee, or any relative living in the immediate<br/>household of the employee, foster parents, or any other person who<br/>reared the employee or the employee's spouse in lieu of parents.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Duty</p>
<p>The District shall provide the teacher a paid leave of absence when called<br/>for jury duty, or when subpoenaed to testify in court as a witness (no<br/>sick leave shall be deducted). The employee must submit any fees<br/>received, less expenses, to the District.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial Accident or Illness</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated employees shall be granted industrial accident or<br/>illness leave whenever the accident or illness is supported by a<br/>licensed California physician's certificate and qualifies under<br/>Workers' Compensation Insurance as being work connected.<br/>The employee will receive full pay only for the first sixty (60)<br/>days of disability. All benefits from Workers' Compensation<br/>Insurance, with the exception of permanent disability<br/>compensation, must be signed over to Hughson Unified School<br/>District. Failure to comply with the conditions outlined above<br/>may, at the discretion of the Hughson Unified School District<br/>Governing Board, cause termination of benefits outlined in this<br/>section.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accident or illness must have arisen out of the course of the<br/>employment of the teacher and must be accepted as a bona fide<br/>injury or illness arising out of, and in the course of, employment<br/>by either the State Compensation Insurance Fund or another<br/>carrier.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher shall notify the District as soon as possible when an<br/>injury or illness arising out of, and in the course of, employment<br/>occurs.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowable leave for each accident or illness shall be for a period<br/>of sixty (60) days during which the schools of the District are<br/>required to be in session or when the teacher would otherwise<br/>have been performing work for the District in any one (1) fiscal<br/>year.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the leave overlap into the next fiscal year, the employee<br/>shall be entitled to only the amount of unused leave due him/her<br/>for the same illness or injury. Allowable leave shall not be<br/>accumulated from year to year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leave shall be reduced by one (1) day for each day of<br/>authorized absence, regardless of a temporary disability<br/>indemnity award.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During any paid leave of absence, the employee shall be paid<br/>such portion of the salary due him/her for any month in which<br/>the absence occurs, which when added to his/her temporary<br/>disability indemnity, will result in a payment not to exceed<br/>his/her full salary.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on paid industrial accident or illness leave, the teacher<br/>shall endorse to the District the temporary disability indemnity<br/>checks received. The District, in turn, shall issue appropriate<br/>salary warrants and shall deduct therefrom normal retirement<br/>and other authorized contributions.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the leave, the teacher shall be entitled to<br/>accrued sick leave, and absence for such purpose shall be<br/>deemed to have commenced on the date of termination of the<br/>industrial accident or illness leave. If the teacher continues to<br/>receive temporary disability indemnity, he/she may elect to take<br/>as much accumulated sick leave which, when added to<br/>temporary disability indemnity, will result in a payment of not<br/>more than full salary. <sup>10</sup></p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher receiving benefits under these rules and regulations<br/>shall, during the period of illness or injury, remain within the<br/>State of California unless the District authorizes travel outside<br/>the state.</p>
<p>H. Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>1. During any school year, an employee may use not more than<br/>seven (7) days of accumulated sick leave for personal necessity<br/>leave as listed below. Except in cases covered by a., b. and c.<br/>below, use of personal necessity leave must be approved in<br/>writing prior to the date of the intended leave. The employee<br/>may be required to submit verification of personal necessity<br/>within five (5) days of the last day of absence under this leave.</p>
<p>a. Death or serious illness of member of the immediate<br/>family or household. &quot;Immediate family&quot; is defined in<br/>Bereavement Leave. This leave may be taken upon<br/>expiration of bereavement leave. &quot;Serious illness&quot;<br/>usually requires, but is not necessarily limited to, a visit<br/>to or by a licensed medical practitioner and the<br/>immediate presence of the employee during the<br/>workday.</p>
<p>b. Accident involving the teacher<br/>or teacher's property, or the person or property of a<br/>member of the immediate family as defined in a. above,<br/>of such an emergency nature that the immediate<br/>presence of the employee is required during the work<br/>day.</p>
<p>c. Other cases of extreme family</p>
<p>emergency.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in court or before any administrative<br/>tribunal as a litigant, party or witness under subpoena<br/>or any order made with jurisdiction.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crucial personal obligations that cannot be done outside<br/>of school hours with advance approval of the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) days of &quot;no tell&quot; leave for other circumstances of</p>
<p>personal necessity will be granted to a teacher without<br/>the teacher having to state a reason. Absence due to<br/>concerted activities is not eligible for this leave.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use up to two (2) days in a</p>
<p>row for &quot;No Tell&quot; do not need to notify the<br/>District in advance, although advance<br/>notification is highly recommended when<br/>possible. (This is established &quot;Past Practice&quot; in<br/>HUSD.) It shall be the teacher's responsibility to<br/>ensure that they have not exceeded their yearly<br/>quota of (5) &quot;No Tell&quot; days.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEA members who need to use more than two<br/>(2) &quot;No Tell&quot; days in a row shall request<br/>approval from the Superintendent stating the<br/>reason for the request not less than 5 school days<br/>before they intend to use those days.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEA members shall not be able to utilize any<br/>&quot;No Tell&quot; days immediately before or after any<br/>vacation or holiday. If the member has a<br/>compelling reason they may request permission<br/>from the Superintendent to waive this provision.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to seven (7) days of this leave will be granted a unit member<br/>for paternity leave, which is to be used within thirty (30) days of<br/>the birth or adoption of the child.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governing Board may approve additional days of personal<br/>necessity for professional improvement or family necessity, with<br/>the teacher having the option of paying for the cost of the<br/>substitute in lieu of loss of sick leave.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family Medical Leave</p>
<p>The District shall provide each bargaining unit member with leave in<br/>accordance with state (Government Code section 12945.2) and/or federal<br/>(PL 103-3) Family and Medical Leave Acts. This leave is without pay,<br/>but includes District-paid benefits at the same level as if the employee<br/>were not on leave. A summary of the current provisions of these laws is<br/>available in the District Office.</p>
<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comp Time</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lieu of the standard reimbursement for substituting during a<br/>prep period, teachers may accumulate &quot;comp time&quot; on a period-<br/>by-period basis.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a teacher has accumulated six class periods, this day may<br/>be used instead of deducting a day from the teacher's pool of<br/>sick days upon the next occurrence of the teacher's absence.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher has a class period covered by another staff member,<br/>comp time may be deducted by period if this results in no<br/>additional cost to the district.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accumulated comp time may be used in any way that would be<br/>otherwise acceptable for absences.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a teacher does not use all of their accumulated comp time, the<br/>comp time shall carry-over until the subsequent year. At the<br/>Superintendent's discretion, comp time may be paid out to the<br/>teacher at the end of a school year at the contracted rate per<br/>period.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Records shall be maintained either at the District Office, or, if<br/>designated by the Superintendent, at the individual sites of the<br/>teacher's accumulated comp time, teachers shall be notified of<br/>their balance, if any, not less than once per year. <sup>7</sup></p>
<p>7. Comp time shall follow the teacher if they change sites<br/>within HUSD.</p>

<p>The District shall reimburse Association members for actual value<br/>mutually agreed upon by the unit member and District of any loss,<br/>damage and/or destruction of clothing or personal property. Except for<br/>clothing, the personal property must be previously approved in writing<br/>for use in the course of performance of duties, unless such damage is due<br/>to negligence by the unit member. With respect to clothing, only items<br/>of exceptional value must have been previously approved in writing.</p></td></tr>

</table>
<p>ARTICLE 10: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIZE</p>
<p>A. The District will make an effort to limit class sizes to the averages set forth below,<br/>within state and federal funding constraints and regulations for Class Size<br/>Reduction programs. Should the class size in any of these grade areas be higher<br/>than that set forth below, the District shall consult with the Association in regard<br/>to developing a resolution process designed to alleviate this situation.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades K-3, as required by regulations; currently twenty (20). If there is<br/>an elimination or reduction of Class Size Reduction funding, the grade<br/>level impacted first will be 3<sup>rd</sup> grade followed by 2<sup>nd</sup> grade and then<br/>other grades as necessary.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 4-6, excluding P.E. and Music: thirty-two (32).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grades 7-12, in the areas of English, Math, Science and Social Science<br/>only: thirty-two (32). Should the average class size for any teacher in any<br/>of these areas be greater than thirty-five (35) students.</p>
<p>a. Maximum class load is the number of contracted periods</p>
<p>multiplied by the maximum class size. The number of periods<br/>and number of students per period is dependent upon the<br/>specific site, subject, and grade level.</p>
<p>Formula: Class Periods X Max Class Size = Max Class Load<br/>Example: 5 periods X 35 students = 175 total students<br/>Example: 6 periods X 35 students = 210 total students</p>
<p>If the District has no alternative but to exceed a teacher's<br/>maximum class load, it will compensate the teacher in the<br/>following manner:</p>
<p>The number of students over the maximum class load will be<br/>divided by the maximum class load; the teacher will receive that<br/>fraction of their salary as additional compensation.</p>
<p>Formula: Overload Students / Maximum Class Load =<br/>Fraction of Additional Salary<br/>Example: 1 Overload Student / 175 Maximum Class<br/>Load = 1/175<sup>th</sup> Additional Compensation</p>
<p>For each month of school where a Max Class Load is exceeded,<br/>the teacher will receive 1/10 of the amount they would have<br/>received if that student were in the class for the entire year. The<br/>District will provide a form and it will be the teacher's<br/>responsibility to complete the form and submit it for any month<br/>where the teacher has had an overload.</p>
<p>4. Special Day classes will have a maximum of eighteen (18) students. If the<br/>District must exceed the special day maximum, the District will negotiate<br/>one/or more of the following options with the teacher, and a designated<br/>representative of HEA:</p>
<p>-Additional compensation for the teacher<br/>-Additional help (an Aide)</p>
<p>-Comp time, or extra prep time</p>
<p>-OR another mutually agreeable remedy</p>
<p>ARTICLE 11:</p>
<p>YEAR ROUND EDUCATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work year</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calendar shall reflect a range of 175-180 student days and<br/>one (1) additional teacher day contiguous with student days.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum days for students shall be held for all tracks at the end<br/>of each track cycle.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall not be required to attend in-service or meetings<br/>during their off-track time; however, if the teacher's presence is<br/>requested and he/she agrees to attend, he/she may opt for in-lieu<br/>days or paid days for the time in attendance.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workday</p>
<p>The length of the instructional day shall be increased to equal the</p>
<p>minutes of a one hundred eighty (180) day work year on a traditional</p>
<p>schedule.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer</p>
<p>1. Initial Placement</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers and administrators at the Elementary School<br/>will meet to determine, by consensus, track placements<br/>of all special programs. If mutual determination, by<br/>consensus, cannot be reached, an advisory vote by the<br/>teachers will be taken to determine the teachers'<br/>position. The results of this advisory vote, along with<br/>the recommendation of the Principal, shall be presented<br/>to the Board of Trustees for final determination.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall meet by grade level and attempt to reach<br/>agreement on track assignment; combination class<br/>teachers can choose which grade to meet with if there<br/>will be openings at both grade levels.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If agreement cannot be reached, the teachers will select<br/>tracks at that grade level by District seniority. Teachers<br/>cannot use seniority to transfer to a grade level where no<br/>opening exists.</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<p>d.</p></td><td>
<p>When a position becomes open at a school site, the<br/>Principal shall post that position within that site only.<br/>After all assignments are made and staffing needs are<br/>met within that site, only then is a vacancy posted<br/>District-wide.</p></td></tr>

<p>&quot;In school districts where a continuous school program<br/>is implemented in fewer than all of the schools<br/>maintained by the school district, the governing board of<br/>such a school district shall make every reasonable effort<br/>to assign certificated employees who prefer the regular<br/>school schedule to schools of the same level retaining the<br/>regular school schedule.&quot; (E.C. §37616.)</p></td></tr>

</table>
<p>agreement on when and how the days will be made up.<br/>Some of the options to be considered are:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting for absent teachers.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching during intercession.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tutoring after school or off-track&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporarily serving as lead teacher.</p>
<p>The make-up time will be monetarily equitable to the<br/>days of work that were not completed. If agreement<br/>cannot be reached, and if no other alternatives can be<br/>determined, days of pay will be deducted equal to the<br/>days not completed. These days are to be made up no<br/>later than the school year following the year they were<br/>not completed.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 1998/99 school year, teachers who are teaching at the<br/>YRE school site shall have the opportunity to substitute within<br/>the year-round school at a sub rate of one hundred seventy-five<br/>percent (125%) of current rate. (Please note that this excludes<br/>teachers who teach at Ross or the High School, and YRE teachers<br/>will not be paid one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) to<br/>substitute at Ross or the High School.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of teachers interested in substituting shall be prepared by<br/>the District and distributed to all teachers.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shall be the responsibility of the teacher to arrange for an off¬<br/>track teacher to serve as a substitute teacher. The teacher will<br/>then notify the appropriate school contact person of their<br/>absence and the off-track teacher who will serve as the<br/>substitute. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an off-track teacher is not available to serve as a substitute, the<br/>teacher will use the normal procedures for securing a substitute<br/>through the County Substitute Teacher Placement Service.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange Days</p>
<p>1. Teachers can voluntarily exchange days with off-track teachers<br/>to a maximum of ten (10) days per school year without loss of<br/>pay, benefits or sick leave. Additional days may be granted by<br/>the site administrator. Teachers shall keep an accounting of days</p>
<p>exchanged and shall notify the site administrator at least three<br/>(3) days in advance unless in the case of an emergency. Payback<br/>of exchange days is the responsibility of the involved teachers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunsetting Clause: For 1998/99 only, the exchange days may<br/>exceed ten (10) days in order to allow teachers to honor<br/>commitments to personal plans that have been previously made<br/>for the months of July and August, or for traditional scheduled<br/>vacations. The notification of exchange days in excess of ten (10)<br/>must be given to the Principal ten (10) days following the<br/>permanent assignment to tracks.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has no responsibility for the enforcement of private<br/>exchange day agreements between individual teachers. The<br/>District shall not be held liable for the payment of additional<br/>compensation based upon any teacher working beyond his or<br/>her regular work year pursuant to any private exchange day<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement teacher shall lose sick leave if he or she<br/>becomes ill. It is the replacement teacher's responsibility to<br/>arrange for a substitute.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only YRE teachers shall be eligible for differential pay leave or<br/>in-lieu days of up to five (5) days to provide them with the<br/>opportunity to attend non-school related conferences,<br/>workshops or meetings which have been scheduled during<br/>periods of time when year-round school employees are on duty<br/>and traditional calendar employees are on recess.</p>
<p>G.</p>
<p>Maintenance of Benefits</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music teachers. Resource Specialist, GATE teachers, Reading<br/>Specialist, and any other specialists may extend or vary their<br/>work year if mutually agreed upon between the employee and<br/>the District.

<p>Full-time teachers at Year-Round Site &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@ 180 days</p>
<p>Full-time teachers shared between sites &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@ 183 days</p>
<p>Incumbent specialists shall be given the first right of refusal for<br/>any extensions of contract.</p>

<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payroll of Year-Round School</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a transfer/reassignment or the ceasing of year-round school<br/>will result in an employee changing to a later payroll cycle, the<br/>employee may remain on his/her current payroll cycle if such an<br/>adjustment is necessary to ensure there is no interruption in<br/>monthly payroll warrants. Employees who request this payroll<br/>adjustment may be required to complete a written request on a<br/>form prepared by the District which will also include an<br/>agreement by the employee to repay the District for any<br/>overpayment in the event that the employee does not complete<br/>the required paid days of service in the school year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units completed by September 1 and verified by December 1<br/>will be given salary credit for the school year.</p>

<p>ARTICLE 14:</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE (See Appendix G for Forms)</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may<br/>from time to time arise concerning the interpretation or application of<br/>the Agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievance&quot; is a claim that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation or misapplication of the provisions of the<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;grievant&quot; is any employee(s) who is/are personally and<br/>directly involved in and adversely affected by an action or<br/>omission which is the basis for the grievance and who file(s) a in<br/>accordance with this Article.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; means a day during which the District Office is open for<br/>business.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. Level I</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thirty (30) days of the act or condition giving rise<br/>to the grievance, the employee shall attempt to resolve<br/>the dispute by informal conference with the principal.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee(s) desire(s) a representative at this<br/>informal conference, he/she will notify the District Office<br/>at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance. The informal<br/>meeting will take place outside the normal student day.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter is not resolved informally, the employee<br/>may submit a grievance in writing within five (5) days to<br/>the principal using Form 1, Appendix H. Said grievance<br/>must be signed by the grievant and clearly specify (1)<br/>the specific provision(s) of this contract that is/are<br/>alleged to have been violated; (2) how said provision(s)<br/>have been violated; (3) the date(s) on which said<br/>violations allegedly occurred; (4) the specific relief<br/>sought by the grievant; and (5) the reasons why the</p>
<p>decision at the informal level was unsatisfactory. Copies<br/>of the grievance shall be sent by the grievant to the<br/>Association and the Superintendent.</p>
<p>2. Level II</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>decision at Level I, the grievant may appeal the decision,<br/>in writing, to the Superintendent using Form 2,<br/>Appendix H. The appeal must be submitted within five</p>
<p>(5) days from receipt of the decision at Level I. The<br/>statement of appeal must include a copy of the original<br/>grievance, the decision rendered, and a clear statement<br/>of the rationale for the appeal.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall communicate his decision, in<br/>writing, within five (5) days from receipt of the appeal. If<br/>the Superintendent does not respond within the time<br/>limits, the grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III</p>
<p>a. Within ten (10) days from receipt of the<br/>Superintendent's decision at Level II, the grievant may<br/>submit the grievance to the Board of Educations using<br/>Form 2, Appendix H through the Superintendent. The<br/>Board may act upon the written submission of the<br/>grievance or forward the matter to Level IV, Binding<br/>Arbitration, within 30 days of receipt of the grievance.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV (Binding Arbitration)</p>
<p>a. If the Governing Board refers a matter to binding<br/>arbitration, or if the grievant is not satisfied with the<br/>decision at Level III, or if no written decision has been<br/>rendered within the timelines required in Level III, the<br/>grievant may submit the grievance to binding<br/>arbitration. The grievant shall notify the Superintendent<br/>and the Association in writing of its decision to submit<br/>the grievance to arbitration within ten (10) days after a<br/>decision has been issued at Level III, or within five (5)<br/>days after the timeline for issuance of a decision at Level<br/>III has passed and a decision has not been issued. The<br/>request for arbitration shall include a copy of the<br/>original grievance, appeals at each level, decisions</p>
<p>rendered at each level, and a clear, concise statement of<br/>the reasons for the appeal.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and District should attempt to agree<br/>upon an arbitrator. If no agreement can be reached, the<br/>parties shall request that the California State Mediation<br/>and Conciliation Services supply a panel of seven (7)<br/>names of persons experienced in hearing grievances in<br/>public schools. Each party shall alternately strike a<br/>name until only one (1) name remains. The arbitration<br/>proceedings shall be conducted under the Voluntary<br/>Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration<br/>Association.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall then hold a hearing and issue a<br/>decision. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in<br/>writing and will set forth her/his findings, reasoning,<br/>and conclusions on the issue(s) submitted. The decision<br/>of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. The<br/>arbitrator shall have no power to make any decisions<br/>amending, changing, subtracting from, or adding to the<br/>provisions of this Agreement, or empower the arbitrator<br/>to render any decision or make an adjustment which is<br/>contrary to law.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parties cannot agree upon the submission<br/>statement, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by<br/>referring to the written grievance documentation and<br/>the responses at each level of the process. If any<br/>question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance,<br/>such question shall be determined by the arbitrator upon<br/>the prior written record of the grievance and responses<br/>before a consideration of the merits of the case.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All costs for the services of the arbitrator, including, but<br/>not limited to, per diem expenses, travel and subsistence<br/>expenses, cost of any hearing room, and transcript costs<br/>will be borne equally by the parties to the grievance.</p>
<p>D. General Provisions</p>
<p>1. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right<br/>of any teacher having a grievance to discuss the matter<br/>informally with any appropriate member of the administration.</p>
<p>and to have the grievance adjusted without intervention by the<br/>Association, provided that the resolution is consistent with the<br/>terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as<br/>possible, the time limits specified at each level be considered to<br/>be maximums and the parties are expected to expedite the<br/>process.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of pendency of any grievance shall in no way operate<br/>to impede, delay or interfere with the right of the District to take<br/>the action complained of.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal a grievance to the<br/>next step within the specified time limits shall preclude any<br/>further appeal on the grievance. Failure by the District to<br/>respond within specified time limits shall authorize the<br/>grievance to proceed to the next step in the procedure. The time<br/>limits specified in any step of this procedure may be changed in<br/>any specific instance only by mutual agreement, signed by the<br/>Superintendent and the grievant or authorized representative of<br/>the grievant.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications and records dealing with the<br/>processing of a grievance will be filed separately from the<br/>personnel files of the participants.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance Forms (Appendix H) will be printed by the District<br/>and given appropriate distribution so as to facilitate operation of<br/>the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In processing grievances, the parties will make a good faith<br/>effort to avoid interruption of the classroom activities and<br/>District operations and unnecessary involvement of students.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District reserves the right to separate grievances filed by two<br/>(2) or more teachers. <sup>9</sup></p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of investigation of any grievance, representatives of<br/>any organization representing the grievant will report to the<br/>office and will identify him/herself as an Association<br/>representative.</p>

<p>Equalized Salary Schedule w/MA Columns for START of 2014-2015 School</p>
<p>Year</p>
<p>The 2014-2015 year will begin with the above schedule which has been &quot;equalized&quot; to a 3.45% or each step and column increase. This<br/>schedule will be adjusted mid-year according to the agreement between HUSD and HEA on the formula for &quot;Average Total<br/>Compensation&quot;. Cells highlighted in green are the cells used in computing the ATC formula. The MA Columns represent a $1000<br/>increase over equivalent BA Column.</p>
<p>PD = Professional Development<br/>MA = $1,000.00 per year</p>
<p>Employee benefit plan includes a choice of medical plans th rough Blue Cross of California and other<br/>providers, ranging from single coverage to full family coverage. Each medical plan includes a life<br/>insurance policy on the employee only. We also offer Delta Dental and Vision Service Plan coverage<br/>ranging from single to family coverage. This District pays $760.83 per month toward the cost of the<br/>coverage selected. Any cost above the District cap is to be paid bv the employee.</p>
<p>For the 2013-2014 school year, HUSD will increase the salary of HEA members to position #4 retroactive<br/>to July 1, 2013. For the 2013-2014 school year, this will be 3.5% of salary.</p>
<p>Unless State budget issues result in fiscal jeopardy to the District, the formula, as previously developed<br/>by the HUSD and HEA jointly, will be implemented in the 2012-2013 and subsequent school year. The<br/>Average Total Compensation formula will be implemented for the 2012-2013 school year with HUSD<br/>salary and benefits at no less than the 6<sup>th</sup> position in Stanislaus County, with HUSD. In the event that</p>
<p>other school districts reduce salaries/benefits thus moving HUSD up in position HUSD will remain<br/>frozen, but not move backward.</p>
<p>The formula shall be computed based on Stanislaus County Salaries on February I<sup>s1</sup> of each year.</p>
<p>Salaries schedules of ALL Stanislaus County school districts shall be collected. The following six cells<br/>shall be averaged and the benefits cap shall be added to the average to arrive at an &quot;average total<br/>compensation&quot;:</p>
<p>Step 1 BA +24/30 Units<br/>Step 5 BA + 45/48 Units<br/>Step 10 BA + 60 Units</p>
<p>Step 14/15 BA + 72/75 Units (if Salary schedule has both 14 and 15 use the average of the two)</p>
<p>Top salary w/ maximum longevity<br/>Top salary w/ maximum longevity + MA</p>
