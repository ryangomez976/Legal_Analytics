<p>ARTICLE VIII<br/>GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance” is a claim by a unit member(s) that there has been a violation,<br/>misinterpretation, or misapplication of the provisions of this Agreement, which<br/>directly affects the grievant(s).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievant” is a unit member(s) who files a grievance. A “grievant” may also be<br/>the Association.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits shall be met unless changes are mutually agreed upon between the grievant and<br/>the District.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal level</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before filing a written grievance, the grievant and immediate supervisor shall<br/>attempt to resolve any alleged violation by informal conference.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If resolution is not reached with the immediate supervisor, the grievant shall meet<br/>with the Superintendent or designee to try to resolve the alleged violation.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal level</p>
<p>1. Level I</p>
<p>a. Any grievance must be presented to the grievant’s immediate supervisor<br/>within five (5) days from the date of the last informal conference. No<br/>grievance shall be processed concerning any action or event which occurred<br/>more than forty-five (45) instructional days prior to the filing of the formal<br/>written grievance. In the event that the grievance occurs within forty-five<br/>(45) instructional days of the close of school, the time line will be extended<br/>to October 1 of the next school year.</p>
<p>-4-</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance, the facts<br/>on which it is based, the date of the grievance, the specific section(s) of the<br/>Agreement allegedly violated, and the specific remedy requested. A copy of<br/>this grievance shall be sent to the immediate supervisor and the Association<br/>president.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor shall communicate a decision to the unit member<br/>in writing within five (5) days after receiving the grievance. If the immediate<br/>supervisor does not respond within the time limit, the grievant may appeal to<br/>the next level.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the above time limit, the grievant or the immediate supervisor may<br/>request a personal conference with the other party.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the<br/>grievant may appeal the decision to the Superintendent or designee within<br/>five (5) days.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appeal should include a copy of the original grievance, and the results<br/>of attempts to resolve the grievance at Level I, and a clear, concise statement<br/>of all the reasons for the appeal. A copy of this appeal shall be sent to the<br/>immediate supervisor and the Association president.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall communicate a written decision with five (5) days<br/>after receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the Superintendent may<br/>request a personal conference within the time limits. If the Superintendent<br/>does not respond within the time limit, the grievant may appeal to the next<br/>level.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance<br/>at Level II, the grievant may, within five (5) days following, submit a written<br/>request to the Association that the Association submit the grievance to<br/>mediation. The Association, by written notice to the Superintendent or<br/>designee within five (5) days after receipt of the grievant’s request, may<br/>submit the grievance to mediation. The parties shall submit to the California<br/>State Conciliation Service a written request for immediate services of a<br/>mediator. The function of the mediator shall be to assist the parties to<br/>achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution of the grievance by means of the<br/>mediation process by providing a written response. The fees and expenses, if<br/>any, of the mediator shall be equally shared by the District and the<br/>Association. All other expenses, except for reasonable released time of the<br/>grievant and his/her representative, shall be borne by the party incurring<br/>them and neither party shall be responsible for the expense of the witnesses<br/>called by the other, except for released time as provided by the law.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset of this process, the mediator shall schedule and hold a<br/>conference at which time the parties to the grievance shall submit to the<br/>mediator copies of all documents completed in conformance with the<br/>requirements at each previous grievance step. In addition, the grievant shall<br/>submit to the mediator and the District a clear, concise, written statement of<br/>the reasons for his/her appeal to the mediation process and the remedies<br/>sought.</p>
<p>-5-</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a satisfactory resolution of the grievance is achieved by means of this<br/>mediation process, both parties of the grievance shall sign a written<br/>statement to that effect and thus waive the right of either party to any further<br/>appeal of the grievance.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Association and the District reach agreement at Level III mediation,<br/>said agreement shall be final and binding upon all parties to the grievance.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association have agreed that this step (mediation) may<br/>be waived by mutual written agreement of the District and the grievant. If no<br/>satisfactory settlement is reached within five (5) teacher workdays following<br/>the receipt of the written response with the mediator, either party may appeal<br/>the grievance to the next step (arbitration).</p>
<p>F The written opinions and conclusions of the mediator are to be given serious<br/>consideration as an acceptable resolution to the dispute, but they may be<br/>rejected by either party by writing to the other stating the reasons for the<br/>rejection. In the event of rejection by either party, the parties agree the<br/>mediator’s suggested resolution may not be offered as evidence in any<br/>subsequent arbitration.</p>
<p>4. Level IV</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level III, the<br/>grievant may within five (5) days submit a request in writing to the<br/>Association for arbitration of the dispute. The Association may then, by<br/>written notice within fifteen (15) days, submit a grievance for binding<br/>arbitration. A copy of this notice shall be sent to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the District receives a copy of the request for binding arbitration, the<br/>Association and the District shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. If no<br/>agreement can be reached, they shall request the State Conciliation Service<br/>to supply a panel of five (5) names of persons experienced in hearing<br/>grievances in public schools. Each party shall delete a name until only one<br/>name remains. The remaining panel member shall be the arbitrator. The<br/>order of the deletion shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator may hear and determine only one grievance at a time unless<br/>the District and the Association expressly agree otherwise. However, both<br/>parties will endeavor to handle in good faith and in an expeditious and<br/>convenient manner those cases which involve similar facts and issues.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall hear evidence and render a decision on the issue or issues<br/>submitted to the arbitrator. If the District and grievant cannot agree upon a<br/>submission agreement, the arbitrator shall refer to the written grievance and<br/>the answers thereto at each step.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne<br/>equally by the District and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne<br/>by the party incurring them.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify the<br/>terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hearing and after both District and grievant have had an opportunity<br/>to make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties<br/>the findings and recommendations which shall be binding to the parties.</p>
<p>General Provisions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals will be taken by any party involved in the grievance procedure by<br/>reason of such participation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievance records will be kept in a separate grievance file in the office of Personnel<br/>Services.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Released time when necessary will be provided by the District for the grievant<br/>and/or representative to participate in the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant is entitled to Association representation at each step of the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all<br/>the steps in this article by the end of the school year, and if leaving it unresolved<br/>until the beginning of the following school year could result in harm to the grievant,<br/>the time limits will be reduced in an attempt to resolve the grievance before the end<br/>of the school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication affects more<br/>than one unit member in a similar manner, the Association may process such a<br/>grievance on behalf of these individuals beyond the informal level.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Level I of the formal level, the Association will provide verification from<br/>all involved unit members that they are a party to the grievance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance is resolved to the satisfaction of any grievant, that individual<br/>will so notify the District and the Association in writing. Said individual<br/>shall no longer be a party to the grievance.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall not continue the grievance beyond the level at which<br/>all the grievants agree a satisfactory resolution has been reached.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Association is the grievant, the grievance shall be initiated at the<br/>Superintendent or designee level of the informal and formal.</p>
<p>ARTICLE IX</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION DUES AND PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS</p>
<p>Unit members who request payroll deductions shall sign and deliver to the District an<br/>assignment authorizing deductions of Association dues and fees.

<p>The Class Size Maximums stated below affirm the parties’ specific agreement as it<br/>pertains to Article XI of the Collective Bargaining Agreement covering the period of<br/>2014-2017. The parties hereby agree that this agreement constitutes a “collectively<br/>bargained alternative average class enrollment for each school site” in grades TK<br/>through 3 in accordance with California Education code section 42238.02 (d) (3)<br/>(D).</p>
<p>If at any time the District learns that compliance with the foregoing contractual<br/>provisions will likely result in penalties which would reduce or eliminate the<br/>additional funding grant for K-3 CSR under LCFF, the parties agree to meet and<br/>negotiate to discuss and implement a mutually agreed upon solution.

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for transfers that are not acted upon by the District on or before October 1<br/>will become inactive and. returned to the unit member.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall select the applicant who possesses the best qualifications for the<br/>position as measured by training, education and experience. The qualifications to be<br/>considered shall be the same as for District-initiated transfers as described in Section<br/>E of this article. If substantially equal qualifications exist between two or more<br/>applicants, the applicant with greater seniority with the District shall be transferred.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit-member initiated transfer request must be submitted to the Personnel Office by<br/>April 1st to receive first consideration for the next school year.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transfer request may be rescinded by the unit member at any time prior to the<br/>transfer being acted upon by the District.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a transfer is denied, upon request of the unit member, the specific reasons for<br/>the denial will be provided. The unit member may then confer with the manager of<br/>Certificated Personnel Services to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time unit members with six (6) or more years in a special education assignment<br/>shall be assigned, upon request, to a regular classroom assignment for at least two<br/>years if a credentialed replacement can be found and there is a vacancy for which<br/>the unit member is fully credentialed and to which another bargaining unit member<br/>is not entitled under this article. After two years in the regular education<br/>assignment, the unit member may at the District’s option be reassigned to a special<br/>education assignment designated by the District.</p>
<p>District-initiated Transfers</p>

<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized teaching methods such as team teaching or shared assignments</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If substantially equal qualifications exist between two or more candidates for a<br/>District-initiated transfer, the unit member at the site who has the least seniority in<br/>the District shall be transferred first.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a school is closed, the unit member-initiated transfer of those displaced will<br/>be given priority consideration for placement into known vacancies. Unit members<br/>not so placed will be transferred using the District-initiated transfer procedure.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a school is overstaffed to the extent that the number of unit members must be<br/>reduced, volunteers shall be transferred first If there are no volunteers the transfer<br/>shall be processed as a District-initiated transfer.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a new school is opened, vacancies will be filled by unit member initiated<br/>transfers before District-initiated transfers are implemented.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may initiate a transfer when it has been determined by the immediate<br/>supervisor, through the evaluation process, that a change in site would improve the<br/>unit member’s performance. A transfer based on the evaluation process shall take<br/>place prior to the beginning of the ensuing school year.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions above, the District may make District-initiated<br/>transfers to provide for the rehiring of terminated unit members.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a transfer is necessary to meet legal requirements or compelling curricular needs<br/>of the District, the Superintendent may make the needed transfer.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When District transfer of a unit member is pending, notice of a transfer will be made<br/>in writing to the unit member. Whenever possible the unit member shall be notified<br/>at least five (5) days prior to the effective date of the transfer. Reasons shall be<br/>included with this notification of transfer and verified by a letter from the manager<br/>of Certificated Personnel Services.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a District initiated transfer of a unit member from one site to another,<br/>the unit member shall be provided with two (2) working days or eight (8) additional<br/>hours at the non-instructional certificated hourly rate of pay at the discretion of the<br/>unit member free of student responsibilities to complete the move. Up to one<br/>additional day may be granted at the discretion of the District. A unit member may<br/>not take a combination of days and hourly pay. The unit members’ supplies and<br/>materials shall be transported by the District.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have the right to trade positions for one year if both unit<br/>members are properly credentialed and agree to the trade with the approval of all<br/>principals of the schools involved and the District Personnel Office. Upon the<br/>conclusion of the year, the trade may become permanent if both unit members and<br/>both principals agree to the permanent change.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members that receive a District initiated transfer due to an enrollment decline<br/>at the unit member’s school shall have the option to return to their original school<br/>site if an opening exists before the start of classes. If an opening occurs after the<br/>start of school, the employee shall be considered for the opening upon request.</p>
<p>13. Unit members with fifteen (15) or more years of experience with the District shall<br/>not be involuntarily transferred if there is a unit member with less than fifteen (15)<br/>years of experience with the District that is credentialed and qualified to fill an open<br/>position and the transfer is not pursuant to items 6, 7, or 8 above or to balance staff<br/>in opening a new school or declining enrollment at a school.</p>
<p>Assignments</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit members will receive their tentative site and teaching assignments by June 1<br/>of each year.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of hiring, new unit members will receive their tentative site and teaching<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after the start of the school year, a unit member’s principal classroom must be<br/>changed, the District will, when requested, provide assistance in moving the unit<br/>member’s supplies and materials.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member is reassigned after the beginning of the school year,<br/>that unit member shall be granted a reasonable amount of released time to prepare<br/>for the new assignment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit member assignments/reassignments shall reflect fair and equitable<br/>consideration by the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>ARTICLE XIII<br/>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>The District shall use this Evaluation Procedure in a fair and equitable manner for the</p>
<p>purpose of helping unit members improve or validate their performance.</p>
<p>Responsible Persons</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor and/or other management employees designated by the<br/>District shall have responsibility for the observation and evaluation of the unit<br/>member. In the case of a multiple site assignment, the unit member shall be assigned<br/>a primary evaluator with input from managers of all sites assigned.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the option of the unit member, an Association representative may take part in any<br/>meeting involved in this procedure.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “formal observation” is a written description of the unit member’s performance<br/>during a mutually agreed upon time segment of no less than thirty (30) minutes and<br/>shall be scheduled during the year the unit member is to be evaluated. The formal<br/>observation shall be documented on form B.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “informal observation” is a written description of the unit member’s<br/>performance during a time segment of no less that than ten (10) minutes. The<br/>informal observation shall be documented on form C.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “evaluation” is a written document based on both the formal and informal<br/>observations. The evaluation shall be documented on form F.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All forms to be used in the Evaluation Procedure shall be mutually agreed upon by<br/>the District and the Association and shall be attached to this agreement (Appendix</p>
<p>A).</p>
<p>Method of Measuring Performance</p>
<p>1. Unit members will be evaluated on the basis of the California Standards for the<br/>Teaching Profession:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard for engaging and supporting ail students in learning</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard for creating and maintaining effective environments for student<br/>learning</p>
<p>(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard for understanding and organizing subject matter for student<br/>learning</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard for planning instruction and designing learning experiences for all<br/>students</p>
<p>(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard for assessing student learning</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard for developing as a professional educator</p>
<p>2. The District retains the right to establish additional procedures for monitoring and<br/>documenting an individual unit member’s performance, provided that such<br/>procedures are not in conflict with this agreement, are the result of a mutually<br/>identified need to improve performance, and are in keeping with the philosophy<br/>stated in Section A of this article.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency of Evaluation All unit members shall be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary unit members once a year</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members once every two (2) years unless a program of remediation<br/>has been identified in the prior year’s annual written evaluation or the performance<br/>of the unit member in the alternate year dictates that an evaluation on a more<br/>frequent basis would be beneficial. Changes in site, job description, or evaluator due<br/>to transfer or reassignment shall not affect the established evaluation cycle of the<br/>permanent unit member.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedures</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual Objectives and,Related Planning</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to October 15 of each school year, each unit member shall submit to<br/>the evaluator annual objectives on form A.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By November 1 of each school year, the evaluator and the unit member shall<br/>meet to mutually agree on the unit member’s annual objectives.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where the evaluator and the unit member are unable to agree on<br/>objectives for the year, adjudication will be made by the next superior of the<br/>evaluator after consulting with both parties.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member is hired or reassigned after the start of the<br/>school year, the dates for the establishment of annual objectives may be<br/>adjusted by mutual agreement between the unit member and the evaluator.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the need occurs to change the unit member’s objectives during the<br/>year, a joint review of the objectives shall be made by the evaluator and the<br/>unit member to mutually agree upon the appropriate changes.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Prior to the end of each year, the unit member and evaluator shall meet to</p>
<p>discuss the annual objectives.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Observation</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Periodically throughout the school year, the evaluator may conduct informal<br/>observations of the unit member's performance. The scheduling of informal<br/>observations shall be at the discretion of the evaluator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may request a conference with the evaluator after an informal<br/>observation.</p>
<p>-21-</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member has the right to attach a written reaction to the observation<br/>form if so desired by the unit member.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All informal observations shall be documented on form C. Contents of these<br/>documents may be used in writing the unit member’s evaluation. If the<br/>contents of an observation are used to support a remediation<br/>recommendation, the observation and any written rebuttal shall be attached<br/>to the evaluation.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The informal observation process shall be applied in a fair and equitable<br/>manner in keeping with the evaluation philosophy stated in Section A of this<br/>article.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Observation and Progress Conference</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All formal observations will be completed before May 1 of the school year<br/>in which the unit member is to be evaluated.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formal observation shall be documented on form B and a copy shall be<br/>included as part of the unit member’s evaluation.</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled to at least one (1) additional observation and<br/>progress conference, if requested.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written record of any progress conference shall be made by the evaluator.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation Conference</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evaluator determines that improvement is required, specific<br/>suggestions shall be made in writing, and the evaluator shall establish a<br/>program in consultation with the unit member in order to assist the unit<br/>member in the correction of the deficiency within a specified period of time.<br/>Such assistance should include specific recommendations by the evaluator,<br/>assistance from district resources, in-service training, and may include<br/>adequate released time to visit and observe other classrooms.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the evaluation shall be based on at least one (1) formal<br/>observation and any informal observations conducted between observations.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member’s signature on the evaluation form acknowledges receipt<br/>and does not necessarily imply agreement with its contents.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ten (10) school days following the evaluation conference, the unit<br/>member may attach a written reaction to the evaluation form which will<br/>become a part of the evaluation record.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation and any responses will be sent to the manager of Certificated<br/>Personnel Services by the evaluator.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not participate in the evaluation of other unit members,<br/>nor can they assess the classroom performance of other unit members (this<br/>does not preclude one unit member assisting another unit member).</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a unit member’s formal or informal observation indicates a need to<br/>improve skills, the unit member’s evaluator shall take immediate affirmative action<br/>to assist and encourage the unit member to correct any documented deficiencies.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific suggestions shall be made in writing, and the evaluator shall establish a<br/>program, in consultation with the unit member, to assist the unit member in the<br/>correction of a deficiency. The assistance should include a timeline for correction,<br/>assistance from District resources, in-service training, and may include adequate<br/>released time to observe other classrooms or receive consultation.</p>

<p>Secondary PLC Procedures and Protocols<br/>May 2014</p>
<p>— Professional Learning Communities (PLC) have been an integral part of the teaching and learning environment<br/>in PYLUSD for the past eight years. Teachers work collaboratively to create common assessments, analyze<br/>results, adjust instructional practices, share best practice, participate in staff development and prepare to<br/>implement Common Core State Standards (CCSS). A commitment to release time for teacher collaboration<br/>continues to be a valuable component of professional development.</p>
<p>In the 2007-2008 school year, PYLUSD and APLE jointly agreed on the importance and structure of<br/>PLCs. The purpose of this memo is to further clarify the goals and vision of our Professional Learning<br/>Communities as we shift to a new model.</p>
<p>The critical question in a PLC is not do we collaborate? but rather, What do we collaborate about? Effective<br/>PLCs are structures in which teachers collaborate to do the real work of education. This collaboration could<br/>include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking together about student tasks - the work we are asking kids to do and the implications for<br/>learning.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the standards, and how they relate to the current curriculum and instructional strategies.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying new summative assessments to understand what kinds of work our students need to be<br/>doing.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identifying, trying out, and refining an expanded repertoire of instructional strategies that brings<br/>greater rigor and variety to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing or re-designing curriculum units to better align with the CCSS, respond to intervention, and<br/>differentiate according to student need.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing current and/or new formative assessments to understand how they do or don’t align with<br/>the new standards.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating clarity around the definitions of the 5 Cs (Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking,<br/>Creativity and Digital Citizenship) and how they apply to classroom strategies in support of the different<br/>content areas.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing ideas about how to leverage technology and 21<sup>st</sup> century tools in the classroom.</p>
<p>Embedded in each PLC meeting are the basic questions: What is it we want all students to learn? How will we<br/>know when they know it? How will we respond when they don’t learn or already know it?</p>
<p>The District and APLE believe in the power of teacher collaboration. To that end, time has been set<br/>aside for teachers to work together within their school day. As a result, we agree to the following<br/>beliefs and practices related to teacher collaboration time:</p>
<p>• PLC rotation schedules will be collaboratively designed by department chairs and site administrators and<br/>then presented to the staff for consensus at/or prior to the fiirst administrative PLC meeting of the school<br/>year. WASC meetings may be included as part of the rotation schedule. The rotation schedule should<br/>include:</p>
<p>o One PLC meeting per month will be at the discretion of the site administrator. Site administrators<br/>will set agendas for these designated meetings. These agendas will be provided to teachers for<br/>informational purposes prior to the meeting. At the conclusion of the meeting, APLE will be<br/>provided time to meet.</p>
<p>o One late start/early release day per month will be dedicated to structured individual teacher<br/>professional development time. This professional development time may be done in teams or as<br/>individuals.The Unit Member maintains the right to individually select their professional<br/>development activity. Unit members are expected to be on site (unless prior approval has been<br/>given to attend a meeting at an alternate District sponsored event) Unit Members will notify the<br/>Department Chair via email of their professional development activity and location prior to each</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Revised on: May 20, 2014</p>
<p>professional development day, The Department Chair will forward this information to the designated<br/>site administrator.</p>
<p>o Two late start/early release days per month will be documented through department agendas.<br/>These agendas will be determined by departments/team/home group/grade/focus group as<br/>determined by the rotation schedule and only provided to the site administrator for informational<br/>purposes prior to each meeting.</p>
<p>Sign in sheets will be submitted to the site administrator after each meeting. Meeting minutes or additional<br/>written documentation is not required.</p>
<p>PLC time is a valuable part of the educational fabric of a school. Teachers should not be called away from<br/>collaboration time for other purposes (including but not limited to lEP’s), except in extenuating<br/>circumstances.</p>
<p>Site administrators are encouraged to attend and may participate in PLC collaborations.</p>
<p>Additional staff meetings may only be convened to address emergency and/or compelling circumstances.<br/>Unit members are expected to be on site (unless prior approval has been given to attend a meeting at an<br/>alternate District sponsored event), on time and engaged in the process.</p>
<p>In months with less than 4 PLC/planning days sites will always include a individual teacher professional<br/>development and a site administrator staff meeting/staff development.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the standards, and how they relate to the current curriculum and instructional<br/>strategies.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying new summative assessments to understand what kinds of work our students need to<br/>be doing.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying, trying out, and refining an expanded repertoire of instructional strategies that bring<br/>greater rigor and variety to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing or re-designing curriculum units to better align with the CCSS, respond to<br/>intervention, and differentiate according to student need.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing current and/or new formative assessments to understand how they do or don’t align<br/>with the new standards.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating clarity around the definitions of the 5 Cs (Communication, Collaboration, Critical<br/>Thinking, Creativity and Digital Citizenship) and how they apply to classroom strategies in<br/>support of the different content areas.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing ideas about how to leverage technology and 21<sup>st</sup> century tools in the classroom.</p>
<p>Embedded in each PLC meeting are the basic questions: What is it we want all students to learn? How will<br/>we know when they know it? How will we respond when they don’t learn or already know it?</p>
<p>The District and APLE believe in the power of teacher collaboration. To that end, weekly elementary</p>
<p>PLC time is being reinstated within their school day according to previous PLC weekly schedule. As a</p>
<p>result, we agree to the following beliefs and practices related to teacher collaboration time:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekly PLC early release days have been re-established beginning in 2014-15.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLC weekly minimum days are 60 minutes in duration and are designed with the intent of providing time<br/>during the school day for grade levels to collaborate and implement the CCSS and 21<sup>st</sup> Century skills.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers, general and special education, will participate in weekly PLC meetings.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eariy and late start kindergartners remain on daily schedule at sites with no lunch built into the day.<br/>Schools with lunch built into the kindergarten day will add 2 minutes to the late start students’ daily<br/>schedule and release 60 minutes early with the remainder of the school.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All teachers are required to receive a 30 minute uninterrupted iunch time on early release days including<br/>kindergarten teachers. Kindergarten teachers without lunch built into their school day will be provided<br/>coverage at dismissal.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>5/20/2014</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Two early release days per month will be documented through team agendas. These agendas will be</p>
<p>determined by grade-level teachers and only provided to the site administrator for informational<br/>purposes prior to each meeting.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign in sheets will be submitted to the site administrator after each meeting. Meeting minutes or additional<br/>written documentation is not required.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One PLC meeting per month will be at the discretion of the site administrator. Site administrators will set<br/>agendas for these designated meetings. These agendas will be provided to teachers for informational<br/>purposes prior to the meeting. At the conclusion of the meeting<sub>J</sub> APLE will be provided time to meet.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One early release day per month will be dedicated for structured teacher planning time. This date will be<br/>identified by the district and will be for the purpose of teacher planning. This planning may be done in<br/>teams or individually. It is the discretion of the teacher as to the structure of this day; however the planning<br/>time must be done at a district school site.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLC time is a valuable part of the educational fabric of a school. Teachers should not be called away from<br/>collaboration time for other purposes (including but not limited to lEP’s), except in extenuating<br/>circumstances.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site administrators are encouraged to attend and may participate in PLC collaborations.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional staff meetings may be convened to address emergency and/or compelling circumstances.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In months with less than 4 Wednesdays, sites will always include a structured individual teacher planning<br/>time and a site administrator staff meeting/staff development.</p>
<p>Teachers will be provided 270 minutes of release time every two weeks in the following way:</p>

<p>Clarification of Elementary PLC Procedures and Protocols<br/>Elementary Monthly Early Release Reinstatement Agreement</p>
<p>May 2014</p>
<p>f— Professional Learning Communities (PLC) have been an integral part of the teaching and learning environment<br/>in PYLUSD for the past eight years. Teachers work coiiaboratively to create common assessments, analyze<br/>results, adjust instructional practices, share best practice, participate in staff development and prepare to<br/>implement Common Core State Standards. A commitment to release time for teacher collaboration continues<br/>to be a valuable component of professional development.</p>
<p>fn the 2007-2008 school year, PYLUSD and APLE jointly agreed on the importance and structure of<br/>PLCs. The purpose of this memo is to further clarify the goals and vision of our Professional Learning<br/>Communities as we shift to a new model.</p>
<p>The critical question in a PLC is not do we collaborate? but rather, What do we collaborate about? Effective<br/>PLCs are structures in which teachers collaborate to do the real work of education. As we begin the<br/>implementation of the CCSS and 21<sup>st</sup> century learning, this collaboration could include:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking together about student tasks - the work we are asking kids to do and the implications for<br/>learning.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the standards, and how they relate to the current curriculum and instructional strategies.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying new summative assessments to understand what kinds of work our students need to be<br/>doing.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying, trying out, and refining an expanded repertoire of instructional strategies that bring greater<br/>rigor and variety to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designing or re-designing curriculum units to better align with the CCSS, respond to intervention, and<br/>differentiate according to student need.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing current and/or new formative assessments to understand how they do or don’t align with<br/>the new standards.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating clarity around the definitions of the 4 Cs and how they apply to classroom strategies in<br/>support of the different content areas.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing ideas about how to leverage technology and 21<sup>st</sup> century tools in the classroom.</p>
<p>Embedded in each PLC meeting are the basic questions: What is it we want all students to learn? How will<br/>we know when they know it? How will we respond when they don’t learn or already know it?</p>
<p>The District and APLE believe in the power of teacher collaboration. To that end, monthly elementary<br/>PLC time is being reinstated within their school day according to previous PLC monthly schedule. As<br/>a result, we agree to the following beliefs and practices related to teacher collaboration time:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two PE release periods a month will be dedicated to grade level collaboration</p>
<p>o Kindergarten designates two after school release times per month</p>
<p>o Moderate/Severe Special Education designates two times per month using instructional aides<br/>o Agendas will be created by teachers at each grade level and submitted to the site administrator<br/>prior to the meeting</p>
<p>o Sign in sheets will be submitted to the site administrator after each meeting with identified<br/>agenda items for the next session (Meeting minutes or additional written documentation is not<br/>required)</p>
<p>o Site administrators are encouraged to attend and may participate in PLC collaborations</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One 60 minute monthly early release Wednesday</p>
<p>o Monthly collaboration may include, but is not limited to, school-wide staff development,<br/>preparing for Common Core State Standards, additional grade level PLC time, program<br/>evaluation, etc.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One staff meeting per month (60 minutes, not to exceed 90 minutes per meeting)</p>
<p>o Staff meetings conducted during the student school year shall not exceed nine (9) meetings per<br/>year (additional meetings may be called to address emergencies/compelling circumstances)</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make up for release time will only be required if release time falls below the contractual agreement of<br/>240 minutes in a two week period which has been caused by the closing of a lab or library, inability to<br/>provide music or PE. Holidays and non-student days will not be counted as missed release time.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools with the QEIA grant may require additional meetings over and beyond district requirement.<br/>However, these meetings will be held during the work day whenever possible. <sup>2</sup></p>
