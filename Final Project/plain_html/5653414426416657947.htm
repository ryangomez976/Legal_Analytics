<p>The Articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding agreement<br/>(&quot;Agreement&quot;) by and between the Board of Trustees of the Central School District (&quot;District&quot;) and<br/>the Central Teachers Organization (an affiliate of CTA/NEA) (&quot;Association&quot;), an employee organization.</p>
<p>This Agreement is entered into pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540-3549 of the<br/>Government Code. <sup>l</sup></p>
<p>l</p>
<p>The District confirms its recognition of the Association as the exclusive representative for regular<br/>classroom teachers, learning handicapped/special day class teachers, resource specialists, vocal and<br/>instrumental music teachers. Speech Pathologists, school counselors, nurses, temporary teachers,<br/>part-time certificated employees serving in the positions above, substitute teachers working 45 or more<br/>consecutive workdays in the same assignment; excluding all other currently existing positions not<br/>designated, including but not limited to substitute teachers working 44 or less consecutive workdays in<br/>the same assignment, short term casual employees, management, supervisory and confidential<br/>employees. <sup>2</sup></p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Except as limited by law and the specific and express terms of this agreement, it is understood<br/>and agreed that the District retains all of its powers and authority to direct, manage and control to the<br/>full extent of the law, and the use of judgment and discretion in connection therewith. Included in, but<br/>not limited to, those duties and powers are the exclusive right to determine, according to the needs of<br/>the District, and to implement the following decisions: organization of the District, the need to hire,<br/>classify, assign, reassign, transfer, evaluate, promote, layoff, reduce hours, and terminate employees,<br/>the time and hours of operation, the kinds and levels of service to be provided, including the methods<br/>and means of providing them, staffing patterns, number and kinds of personnel required, the<br/>curriculum, the methods of raising revenue, the need to contract out work, direct the work of<br/>employees, establish educational policies, goals and objectives, ensure the rights and educational<br/>opportunities of students, maintain the efficiency of district operation, build, move or modify facilities,<br/>establish budget procedures and determine allocations.</p>
<p>Both parties recognize that there may occur certain exigent circumstances when emergency<br/>action is required. Emergencies shall be limited to unforeseen events of such extreme magnitude as to<br/>make the affected provisions of the contract reasonably and objectively nonperformable and require<br/>action by the District in response thereto. In the event of such a bona fide emergency, the District may<br/>act to respond to the emergency and performance of affected provisions of this Agreement may<br/>be temporarily suspended. The parties then agree to meet and negotiate as soon as possible to arrive<br/>at a mutually agreeable solution concerning the effects of the decision of the District. Such suspension<br/>shall be terminated promptly when the emergency ends. <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>3</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agency Fee</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer agrees to deduct agency fees, as required by SB 1960, from the pay of<br/>unit members who do not become members of the Association.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the Employer for membership dues or agency fees,<br/>the Employer agrees to remit such moneys promptly to the Association accompanied by an annual<br/>alphabetical list of unit members, due November 1<sup>st</sup>, for whom such deductions have been made,<br/>revising the list as personnel changes are made.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association and Employer agree to furnish to each other any information needed to<br/>fulfill the provisions of this Article.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious Objectors</p>
<p>1. No unit member shall be required to join the Association or to make an agency fee<br/>payment if the unit member is an actual verified member of a bona fide religious body or sect which has<br/>historically held conscientious objection to joining or financially supporting employee organizations;<br/>defined by Government Code 3540.1 (d). The Association may require a unit member to verify that this<br/>exemption applies under the rules of the Public Employment Relations Board. Such employee must,<br/>instead, arrange with the Association to satisfy his/her obligation by donating the equivalent amount to<br/>a non-labor, non-religion charitable fund, tax exempt under section 501 Section 3 of the Internal<br/>Revenue code, chosen from the following list:</p>
<p>United Way</p>
<p>American Cancer Society<br/>American Red Cross</p>
<p>Payment to the organization may be made by personal payment, or through monthly<br/>payroll deductions. If choosing personal payment, proof of payment shall be made on an annual basis to<br/>the Association and Employer. If choosing payroll deduction, proof of payment shall be provided to the<br/>Association by the District. Proof of payment is a requirement for continued exemption from the<br/>payment of agency fee. No in-kind services may be received for payments, nor may the payment be in a<br/>form other than money such as the donation of used items.</p>
<p>3. Any unit member making payments as set forth in sections above, and who requests that<br/>the grievance or arbitration provisions of this Article 4 be used in her or his behalf, shall be responsible<br/>for paying the reasonable cost of using said grievance or arbitration procedures. <sup>4</sup></p>
<p>4</p>
<p>C. Hold Harmless</p>
<p>The Central Teachers Organization and the California Teachers Association agree to<br/>indemnify and hold harmless the District against any and all liabilities, claims or actions which may be<br/>brought against said District or District Board of Trustees individually or collectively, its offices,<br/>employees and agents including all costs, legal expenses, fees and judgments and costs for providing<br/>a defense on behalf of the District at the Association's expense against any and all lawsuits or legal<br/>proceedings which results from the collection of agency fees.</p>
<p>I understand and agree that my failure to notify the district within 30 working days<br/>of the commencement of my duties of my desire either to join the union or to make<br/>a charitable contribution will be taken as a desire on my part to join the union rather<br/>than make a contribution equivalent to the dues to the United Way charity. Payroll<br/>deductions will be made from my paycheck commencing the first pay period my<br/>deduction can be processed by the payroll department after the 30 working days<br/>have elapsed.</p>
<p>Signed: _</p>
<p>Dated:_</p>
<p>A copy of this memo will be signed and given to the payroll clerk and a copy will be given to the<br/>new employee.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Unit members will receive compensation and benefits in accordance with this Article.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SALARIES - the following section has been amended as a result of the 2013-2014 contract<br/>negotiations.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary/economic settlement with the Central Teachers Organization for the<br/>2014-2015 contract year includes the following:</p>
<p>a. The 2014-15 salary schedule, steps 1 -13, columns 1 - 7 exclusive of longevity<br/>increments shall be increased by 5% effective July 1, 2014.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salary/economic settlement with the Central Teachers Organization for the<br/>2013-2014 contract year includes the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2013-2014 salary schedule shall include a 3% increase retroactive to July 1, 2013.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An annual stipend in the amount of $500 will be given to all RSP and SDC teachers in<br/>equal monthly installments retroactive to July 1, 2013.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, the Central Teachers Organization acknowledges that raises in the second<br/>and/or third year of the contract are dependent upon the district's financial condition.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central School District agrees to extend the current Health and Welfare Benefits package<br/>utilizing the three-tiered program offered through SCSEBA: Anthem Market Place, Kaiser, Delta Dental,<br/>Vision Service Plan, and Prudential Long Term Disability Insurance. Furthermore, the employee<br/>contribution pool concept currently in force will remain with a maximum contribution by the district of<br/>$9,690 per employee, effective July 1, 2007. Savings from single and two-party coverage will continue to<br/>be used to offset out-of-pocket premium costs for two-party and family coverage. All costs realized by<br/>each individual employee above the district contribution of $9,690 and the pooled plan specific savings<br/>are the responsibility of each individual employee.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following categories of certificated employees do not receive health insurance and<br/>other fringe benefits: substitutes, summer school staff, and regular hourly employees working less than<br/>20 hours per week.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued Insurance Coverage After Exhaustion of Sick Leave Entitlement: Unit<br/>members who have exhausted their entitlement to paid sick leave shall, nevertheless, continue to<br/>receive full insurance coverage for that period of illness through September 30<sup>th</sup> of any given calendar<br/>year in which the paid sick leave entitlement is exhausted.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option to Continue Health, Dental and Vision Insurance During Unpaid Leave of Absence:<br/>Unit members on extended leaves of absence under Article 9 - LEAVE PROVISIONS, Section I herein shall<br/>have the option of participating in existing health insurance coverage and dental and vision plan. Said<br/>teachers shall pay the premiums for the continued coverage for the duration of the leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member may participate in any tax sheltered annuities provided through the<br/>Schools First Federal Credit Union or its successor with the District providing payroll deduction for this<br/>purpose.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a unit member's employment terminate, such unit member shall be entitled to<br/>continued coverage for 30 days following their final day of employment.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide an income protection plan. This policy will insure an employee, in<br/>the event of a long-term disability, will receive 66 2/3 percent of their salary (up to a maximum of $5,000<br/>per month). This insurance coordinates with other group and statutory benefits in order to make up the<br/>difference between those benefits and 66 2/3 percent of the employee's salary. This benefit takes place<br/>after a 60-day waiting period has occurred.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic Partner</p>

<p>previously served time, but shall not count as timed served. Similarly, a permanent employee who<br/>leaves district employment but returns within 39 months shall not forfeit previously served time. If such<br/>a person does not return to service within said period of time, he/she shall be deemed to have broken<br/>continuity of service and to have forfeited previously served time.</p>

<p>I,_, acknowledge that I will accept_percent of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the</p>
<p>District's contribution towards my health and welfare benefits and I will assume_percent</p>

<p>HR-18 (4/14)</p>
<p>Article 9 - LEAVE PROVISIONS</p>
<p>The benefits which are expressly provided by this section, LEAVE PROVISIONS, are the sole leave<br/>benefits which are part of this collective Agreement, and it is agreed that other permissive statutory or<br/>regulatory leave benefits are not incorporated, whether directly or impliedly, into this Agreement.<br/>However, this Agreement does not preclude unit members from entitlement to other leave benefits<br/>mandated by Statute.</p>
<p>A. PERSONAL ILLNESS AND INJURY LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full time members shall be entitled to 10 days leave with full pay for each school year in<br/>cases of personal illness or injury. Unit members who work less than full time shall be entitled to such<br/>proportion of the 10 days leave as the number of hours per week of scheduled duty relates to the number<br/>of hours for a full time unit member in a comparable position.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all earned leave as set forth in &quot;1&quot; above, and all accumulated sick leave as<br/>described in &quot;3&quot; below is exhausted, additional non-accumulated leave shall be available for a period not<br/>to exceed five school months, provided that the provisions of &quot;4&quot; below are met. The amount deducted<br/>for leave purposes from the unit member's salary shall be the amount actually paid a substitute<br/>employee employed to fill the position during the leave, or, if no substitute is employed, the amount<br/>which would have been paid to a substitute.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member does not utilize the full amount of leave as authorized in &quot;1&quot; above in<br/>any school year, the amount not utilized shall be accumulated from year to year. Accumulated sick leave<br/>shall be transferable as provided in Education Code Section 13468.1.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request by district management, a unit member shall be required to present a<br/>medical doctor's certificate verifying the personal illness or injury and/or a medical authorization to<br/>return to work. The District may require at its expense a certified medical specialist to visit the unit<br/>member and make all necessary inquiries in order to be fully informed as to the nature and severity of<br/>the illness or injury, and to report such findings to the Superintendent or designee. If the report<br/>concludes that the absence is not due to the personal illness or injury, or that the illness is not<br/>sufficiently severe to warrant continued absence, then the Superintendent or designee, after notice to<br/>the unit member, may refuse to grant such leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever possible, a unit member must contact the Central School District Absence<br/>Reporting System (or designee if reporting system is down) as soon as needed but no later than 7:00 am<br/>of the actual work day. After 7:00 am the unit member must call the school office to report his/her<br/>absence.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member who is absent for one-half day or less shall have deducted one-halfday<br/>from the accumulated leave; and if the absence exceeds more than one-halfday, a full day shall be<br/>deducted from accumulated leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be notified of their accumulated leave total and their sick leave<br/>entitlement for the school year on their monthly pay warrant.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PERSONAL NECESSITY LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use no more than seven (7) of their ten (10) annual personal illness<br/>days for purposes of personal necessity. No such leave shall be permitted for purposes of personal<br/>convenience, for the extension of a holiday or vacation, or for matters which can be taken care of<br/>outside working hours.</p>
<p>Per Ed Code 45207 Personal Necessity leave may be used for the following reasons:</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To extend bereavement upon the death of a family member (as stated in C-2)</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accident involving the member's person or property or of a member's immediate<br/>family</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance in court as a litigant or witness</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imminent danger to the employee's home</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illness of a member or a member's immediate family</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial-Condition/Circumstances, if unattended, would result in an</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unconscionable financial loss</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observance of a religious holiday of the member's faith</p>
<p>■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth or adoption of a unit member's child</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the utilization of personal necessity leave, a unit member must notify the<br/>appropriate management person 24 hours in advance of their intention to take personal necessity leave.<br/>Should an emergency arise in which the unit member is unable to give 24 hours' notice, the unit<br/>member shall make every effort to comply with the District's procedures to enable the District to secure<br/>a substitute.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BEREAVEMENT LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be entitled to a maximum of three days leave of absence, or five<br/>days leave of absence if out-of-state travel or travel in excess of 400 miles one way is required, without<br/>loss of salary or deduction from sick leave, on account of the death of any member of his/her immediate<br/>family.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this provision, an immediate family member shall be limited to mother,<br/>father, grandmother, grandfather, or a grandchild of the unit member or of the spouse or domestic</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>partner of the unit member; and the spouse or domestic partner, son, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-<br/>law, brother, sister, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, stepchild, or guardian of the unit member; or any<br/>person living in the immediate household of the unit member.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to use sick leave as set forth in &quot;A-l&quot; and &quot;A-2&quot; for disabilities<br/>caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, false pregnancy, childbirth, and recovery therefrom<br/>on the same terms and conditions governing leaves of absence from other illness or medical disability.<br/>The length of such disability leave, including the date on which the leave shall commence and the date<br/>on which the duties are to be resumed, shall be determined by the unit member and the unit member's<br/>physician.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members are entitled to leave without pay or other benefits for disabilities because<br/>of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom when sick leave as set forth in &quot;A-l&quot; and &quot;A-<br/>2&quot; has been exhausted. The date on which the unit member shall resume duties shall be determined by<br/>the unit member on leave and the unit member's physician; however, the District management may<br/>require a verification at district expense of the extent of disability through a physical examination of the<br/>unit member by a physician appointed by the District or by consultation with the unit member's<br/>physician.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHILDREARING LEAVE AND ADOPTION LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave without pay or other benefits may be granted to a unit member for childrearing or</p>
<p>adoption.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member shall request such leave as soon as practical, but under no<br/>circumstances, no less than 60 workdays prior to the date on which the leave is to begin; except in the<br/>case of adoption or premature childbirth, in which case notice shall be given as soon as possible. Such<br/>requests shall be in writing and shall include a statement as to the date the employee wishes to begin<br/>and end the leave without pay.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of such leave shall consist of no more than 12 consecutive months and shall<br/>automatically terminate on June 30th in the school year in which such leave is granted. An extension of<br/>leave may be granted, not to exceed an additional 12 months.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit member is not entitled to the use of any accrued sick leave or any other paid<br/>leave while such employee is on the Childrearing Leave or Adoption Leave, whether or not the illness or<br/>disability is related to a pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>5. If a unit member is on leave for childbearing or childrearing and experiences a<br/>miscarriage or death of a child subsequent to childbirth, the unit member may request an immediate<br/>assignment to a unit member position. If there is a vacancy for which a unit member is qualified, the<br/>District shall assign the unit member to a position as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>To the extent prohibited by law, there shall be no reduction in salary or health benefits<br/>provided in this Agreement in connection with unit members seeking childrearing or adoption leave<br/>except that no person shall be entitled to compensation, increments, or the accrual of seniority for<br/>layoff or reduction in force purposes, nor shall the time taken on parental leave count toward credit for<br/>provisionary teachers in earning tenure status.</p>
<p>F. INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT LEAVE</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be entitled to Industrial Accident Leave according to the provisions<br/>of Education Code Section 44984 for personal injury which has qualified for workers' compensation<br/>under the provisions of the District's plan.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such leave shall not exceed 60 workdays during which the schools of the District are<br/>required to be in session or when the unit member would otherwise have been performing work for the<br/>District in any one fiscal year for the same industrial accident.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District has the right to have the unit member examined at the District's expense by<br/>a physician designated by the District to assist in determining the length of time during which the unit<br/>member will be temporarily unable to perform assigned duties and the degree to which a disability is<br/>attributable to the injury involved.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any days of absence from duty as a result of the same industrial accident, the unit<br/>member shall endorse to the District any wage loss benefit check from the District's &quot;Health Insurance<br/>for Public Employees&quot; plan which would make the total compensation from both the District and the<br/>District's insurance plan exceed 100% of the amount the unit member would have received as salary had<br/>there been no industrial accident or illness.</p>
<p>If the unit member fails to endorse to the District any wage loss disability indemnity<br/>check received on account of the industrial accident or illness as provided above, the District shall<br/>deduct from the unit member's salary warrant the amount of such disability indemnity actually paid to<br/>and retained by the unit member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits provided in this paragraph are in addition to sick leave benefits. When<br/>entitlement to industrial accident leave has been exhausted, a unit member shall be entitled to utilize<br/>any accrued sick leave benefits.</p>

<p>FMLA may also be used for qualifying emergencies arising out of deployment of a family<br/>member in the regular U.S. armed forces or caregiving to a veteran with serious injuries as defined in<br/>FMLA (Federal Government Code Section 12945.2).</p>
<p>Accrued sick leave may be used during FMLA leave at the employee's request. Employees<br/>taking this leave shall be reinstated in the same or a comparable position upon returning from family<br/>care leave, except as allowed by law.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>For the duration of the FMLA/CFRA leave, the district will maintain health coverage under<br/>the district's group health plan. Employees must continue to pay any required contribution for such<br/>coverage.</p>
<p>L. CATASTROPHIC LEAVE</p>
<p>The purpose of the Catastrophic Leave Bank is to provide additional paid leave for district<br/>employees who have made prudent use of their sick leave, but due to catastrophic reasons have need of<br/>more sick leave.</p>
<p>The District shall maintain a Catastrophic Leave Bank for eligible employees subject to the<br/>terms of this Article.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership in the Catastrophic Leave Bank: Any unit member or manager who has<br/>been employed by the District for at least 20 calendar months is eligible for membership in the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations of Sick Leave to the Bank: Eligible employees may donate accumulated and<br/>unused sick leave (as opposed to &quot;advanced&quot;) to the Catastrophic Leave Bank. Donations of sick leave<br/>are subject to the following limitations and conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An &quot;open enrollment period&quot; shall be offered each November to encourage<br/>donations by eligible employees. If an employee becomes eligible for the Bank after the November<br/>&quot;open enrollment period&quot; he/she may donate within 30 days of gaining eligibility. Initial donations shall<br/>be made in whole-day increments with a maximum of one sick leave day.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donation shall be filed with the District payroll department on a &quot;Sick Leave<br/>Donation Form&quot;. All donations are irrevocable.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sick leave donor may not donate sick leave that would cause his/her personal<br/>earned sick leave balance to fall below 15 days.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payroll department will maintain a permanent list of all employees who have<br/>donated to the Bank. An updated copy of the permanent list shall be sent to the Association by<br/>November 1<sup>st</sup> of each year.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payroll department shall give written acknowledgement to each donor at the<br/>time his/her donation is received.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the number of days remaining in the Bank falls below 100, an additional donation<br/>shall be requested (but not required) of current members of the Bank. Should such condition arise, the<br/>District shall notify each Association and a joint request shall be made. In this event, subsequent<br/>individual donations beyond the initial donation may be made in whole-day increments with a maximum<br/>of three days per year.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>g. Unit members who are retiring or leaving the employment of the District may<br/>contribute any portion of their unused sick leave to the Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility for Catastrophic Leave: Any employee who suffers from a catastrophic injury<br/>or illness, or who is required to take time off from work to provide care for a member of his or her<br/>immediate family who suffers from a catastrophic injury or illness, shall be eligible to receive<br/>catastrophic leave (donated sick leave). Catastrophic illness or injury shall be defined as a serious illness<br/>or injury that incapacitates the employee for over 15 consecutive work days; requires inpatient medical<br/>care or continuing treatment by a health care provider; and creates a financial hardship for the<br/>employee because he or she has exhausted all of his or her sick leave. Long-term therapy (i.e.<br/>chemotherapy, dialysis, and physical therapy) shall be treated as a catastrophic illness or injury even<br/>though it is not in increments of over 15 consecutive days.</p>
<p>For purposes of this section, &quot;immediate family&quot; shall be defined in the same manner as<br/>under the state and federal family and medical leave laws. Immediate family shall include only the<br/>employee's spouse or domestic partner, parents, or dependent children, as defined in the Family and<br/>Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA; 29U.S.C. SS2611, et seq.) and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA;<br/>Government Code Section 12945.2).</p>
<p>Eligibility for catastrophic leave shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee requesting donated sick leave must have exhausted all of his/her<br/>accumulated sick leave, but still may have differential pay available.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employee must be a member of the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants must have received no written warnings for excessive absenteeism<br/>during the two years immediately preceding the request for catastrophic leave.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any right or entitlement to leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act<br/>(FMLA; 29U.S.C. SS2611, et seq.) and/or the California Family Rights Act (CFRA;<br/>Government Code Section 12945.2), shall run concurrently with any paid leave<br/>used pursuant to this Article.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for Leave:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who meets the eligibility requirements for catastrophic leave may<br/>request donation(s) of sick leave from the Catastrophic Leave Bank by submitting a &quot;Catastrophic Leave<br/>Request for Withdrawal Form&quot; to the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources. A copy shall also be<br/>provided to the representative appointed by the Association.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants applying to withdraw from the Bank will be required to submit a<br/>statement from a licensed physician indicating that the illness or injury of the employee or member of<br/>his or her immediate family meets the definition in Section 3 and the probable length of absence from</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>work. The committee shall keep any and all information obtained pursuant to this section strictly<br/>confidential.</p>
<p>c. In the event that the employee is personally unable to request catastrophic leave, an<br/>agent of the employee or family member may make the request.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Committee: A Catastrophic Leave Committee consisting of one<br/>District representative, one representative appointed by the CTO Association president, and one<br/>representative appointed by the CSEA President shall be established each fiscal year.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee shall consider all requests to receive catastrophic leave. The<br/>committee may grant, partially grant, or reject a request. All decisions to grant catastrophic leave shall<br/>require mutual agreement. The decision of the committee is final and not subject to the grievance<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written copy of the committee's decision shall be provided to the payroll<br/>department so that the Catastrophic Leave Bank balance can be appropriately adjusted.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall not be denied for any discriminatory reason, including but not<br/>limited to, the type of illness or disability.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose the nature of<br/>the request except as is necessary to process the request for withdrawal and defend against any legal<br/>actions related to the grant or denial of leave.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Bank information, including participants' names, requests for withdrawals,<br/>reasons for such requests, amounts withdrawn by any specific participant, and any medical or similar<br/>information supplied in support of request for withdrawal, shall be kept strictly confidential and shall be<br/>kept in locked and secure cabinets. The committee shall be responsible for ensuring the confidentiality<br/>and security of any medical information.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implementation Procedures:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each catastrophic leave shall conclude after 45 workdays, or at the end of the<br/>employee's work year, or when the employee returns to work, whichever event occurs first. If the same<br/>or another injury or illness continues or arises at a later time, another request for catastrophic leave<br/>may be submitted, subject to the limitations in Section 6b.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in exceptional and highly unusual circumstances, as determined by the<br/>Catastrophic Leave Committee, the total amount of catastrophic leave received for any single illness or<br/>injury shall not exceed 180 days. Catastrophic leave is not meant to replace the District's disability pay<br/>program. Catastrophic leave may be used prior to using the disability pay program.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee who uses catastrophic leave shall be paid at his/her regular daily rate.<br/>No distinction shall be made as to the differing pay rates of the donors or recipients.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any catastrophic leave that is granted to an employee but not used, shall be<br/>redeposited in the Catastrophic Leave Bank.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the Bank may not be used for illness or injury that qualifies the<br/>participant for Workers' Compensation Benefits, unless and until the participant has exhausted all<br/>Workers' Compensation Leave (pursuant to Education Code Section 44984 and Article 9 - LEAVE<br/>PROVISIONS, Section B, Personal Injury Leave, of this Agreement). If the participant is receiving<br/>Workers' Compensation temporary disability payments, he or she must sign over those payments in<br/>order that he or she receives no more than 100% of his or her salary. If the participant is receiving<br/>temporary disability payments, the participant's withdrawals from the Bank shall be reduced only in the<br/>amount necessary to provide a full day's wages or salary.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A participant's request for withdrawal from the Bank may be denied, or withdrawal<br/>terminated, if the participant or member of his or her immediate family no longer suffers from a<br/>catastrophic illness or injury as defined in Section 3, or if the participant has submitted false, misleading,<br/>inaccurate, or incomplete information in order to obtain leave from the Bank.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and Association Understanding:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association(s) agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf or on behalf of any<br/>unit member, any grievance, claim or lawsuit related to this leave.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association(s) also agrees that it will not file, on its own behalf or on behalf of<br/>any unit member, any grievance, claim or lawsuit of any kind which attempts to challenge in any way the<br/>legality or enforcement of this provision.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association(s), for itself and its agents, assigns, successors and successors in<br/>interest, shall defend and hold the District and any of its officers, employees, and agents, harmless<br/>against any and all claims, damages, or liabilities brought by third parties against the District or any of its<br/>officers, employees, or agents, and any and all sums that the District or any of its officers, employees,<br/>and agents may be obligated to pay by reason of any liability imposed upon them for damages, arising<br/>out of or in connection with the administration of the Catastrophic Leave Bank under this Article. Such<br/>sums shall include, but not be limited to, in the event of legal action, court costs, expenses of litigation,<br/>and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee Return from Catastrophic Leave: Upon return from catastrophic leave<br/>pursuant to this Article, the District shall return the employee to the same or equivalent position, subject</p>
<p>to all requirements and limitations of law, including but not limited to the Americans with Disabilities Act,<br/>the California Fair Employment Housing Act, FMLA, and CFRA.</p>
<p>9. Termination of the Bank:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days remaining in<br/>the Bank shall be equitably distributed among all members of the Bank currently employed by the<br/>District.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Article and the Bank shall be limited by the effective dates of<br/>this collective bargaining agreement and shall automatically terminate at the end of this Agreement<br/>unless the District and Association(s) agree in writing to continue the Bank and this Article beyond the<br/>contract term.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be evaluated on standards of expected student progress that are not<br/>within their area of responsibility. Objectives for realizing the standards of expected student progress<br/>shall be initially set by the evaluator and may be modified at any time during the school year by mutual<br/>agreement of the evaluator and the evaluatee. When requested by the unit member, added<br/>individualized objectives may be included in the evaluation criteria. The unit member may submit a<br/>written response to any objectives established by the evaluator.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District management shall evaluate all tenured bargaining unit members no less than<br/>once every two years and probationary bargaining unit members no less than once every year. All unit<br/>members who are scheduled to be formally evaluated during the year shall have at least one formal<br/>evaluation observation by their evaluator no later than the end of the first week of December of their<br/>scheduled year for evaluation. Employees that have submitted a resignation or retirement letter to the<br/>Human Resources Department prior to December 1<sup>st</sup> of the current school year will not be evaluated in<br/>their last year of employment.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall be the unit member's immediate supervisor and/or any other<br/>management or supervisory employee who is so designated by District management. Those unit<br/>members who are scheduled to be formally evaluated shall be notified as to which member of the<br/>District management staff will act as the evaluator for the scheduled formal evaluation. The observation<br/>required under Paragraph &quot;D&quot; herein shall be the responsibility of the designated management<br/>evaluator.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those unit members who are regularly scheduled to be formally evaluated shall be so<br/>notified by management within the first six weeks of each school year. The evaluator shall hold at least<br/>one Inservice session to acquaint the evaluatees with the District's philosophy and goals, job<br/>descriptions, and evaluation standards and procedures. If either the evaluatee or the evaluator shall<br/>request an individual conference for further information or clarification, this shall be arranged within<br/>15 school days.</p>
<p>Unit members, other than those working on Professional Growth Project evaluations, shall be<br/>observed at least once (twice for probationary unit members) by the evaluator prior to his/her scheduled<br/>formal evaluation. Unit members who have reached agreement on a Professional Growth Project<br/>evaluation with their principal may be observed. The evaluator shall provide unit members with a written<br/>report of the observation within 10 school days of the observation. The report shall be signed and dated<br/>by the evaluator. Any unit member who receives a negative report as a result of a regularly scheduled</p>
<p>observation shall, upon request, be entitled to a subsequent observation conference, and written<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>The evaluator will inform the unit member, either prior to or upon entering the room, that<br/>his/her presence is for the purpose of a formal observation.</p>
<p>If any deficiencies are indicated by the observation report, the evaluator shall hold a<br/>conference with the evaluatee to make specific recommendations as to the areas of needed<br/>improvement and the evaluatees performance, including any need for Inservice training, conferences,<br/>and/or university course work, and shall endeavor to counsel and give reasonable assistance as<br/>determined by the evaluator in improving performance in such areas.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final evaluation conference shall be held no later than 60 days prior to the end of the<br/>school year for probationary teachers and 30 days prior to the end of the school year for permanent<br/>teachers. The evaluator will present the written evaluation and discuss the matter with the unit<br/>member. The unit member must sign the evaluation, signifying only that the unit member has read the<br/>document and has been provided the opportunity of attaching a written response in accordance with<br/>Education Code, Section 44031, which shall become part of the permanent record. The unit member<br/>shall receive a copy of all written evaluations to be placed in the personnel file. Such evaluations shall<br/>be signed and dated by a management representative.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall not be required to participate in the evaluation and/or observation of<br/>other unit members nor shall they be required to assess their own performance.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of unit members shall not be based on attendance at voluntary District<br/>enrichment programs or voluntary District staff development days. The District and the Association<br/>recognize that there are many ways to maintain professional competency. These may include, but not<br/>be limited to. District sponsored staff development, voluntary enrichment programs, external staff<br/>development and/or course work at the university level.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District recognizes that minimal teaching facilities and equipment, consistent with the<br/>current state of the art, should be provided in the teaching environment. The lack of such facilities or<br/>equipment shall be taken into account during the evaluation of unit members.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>The District shall not inquire into, nor predicate any negative evaluation or other adverse action<br/>upon a teacher's personal, political, and organizational activities or preferences, except as authorized for<br/>specific crimes and violations listed in the Education Code, and as the activity affects the requirements<br/>of the position.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members recognize the value of parent support in the classroom. In order to maintain<br/>the instructional integrity for all students, parents or guardians wishing to visit or observe in a unit<br/>member's classroom shall request an appointment to do so. The time, date and duration of the visit<br/>will be mutually agreed upon by the unit member, parent/guardian and administrator. Should the<br/>visit/observation become disruptive, the unit member will follow Penal Code 656.7</p>
<p>Observations shall not be disruptive to the instructional setting or be construed as<br/>harassment of the unit member. If during the course of the observation the parent/guardian's presence<br/>becomes disruptive, the unit member shall have the authority to tell the parent/guardian to leave the<br/>classroom.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may suspend (Ed Code 48910) any pupil from the teacher's class, for any of the<br/>acts enumerated in Ed Code 48900, for the day of the suspension and the day following. The teacher<br/>shall immediately report the suspension to the principal of the school and send the pupil to the principal<br/>or the principal's designee for appropriate action. If that action requires the continued presence of the<br/>pupil at the school site, the pupil shall be under appropriate supervision, as defined in policies and<br/>related regulations adopted by the Governing Board of the school district. As soon as possible, the<br/>teacher shall ask the parent or guardian of the pupil to attend a parent-teacher conference if the<br/>teacher or the parent or guardian so requests. The pupil shall not be returned to the class from which<br/>he or she was suspended, during the period of the suspension, without the concurrence of the teacher<br/>of the class and the principal.</p>
<p>A pupil suspended from a class shall not be placed in another class during the period of<br/>suspension. If the pupil is assigned to more than one class per day, the pupil will return to their regular<br/>schedule after the period of suspension is completed.</p>
<p>A teacher may also refer a pupil, for any of the acts enumerated in Ed Code 48900, to the<br/>principal or the principal's designee for consideration of a suspension from the school.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an emergency closure of District facilities, including but not limited to<br/>natural disaster, quarantine, or government order, unit members shall receive their daily rate of pay<br/>and benefits. If make-up days are required by law and/or for apportionment purposes, the District<br/>shall negotiate the scheduling of said days with the Association. Make-up days must be completed the<br/>same fiscal year of the closure.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any data or other information that is placed in a unit member's personnel file to be used for<br/>formal evaluation must be filed promptly upon becoming known, but in any event, prior to such<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be provided a copy of any negative or derogatory materials before the<br/>materials are placed in their personnel file. The unit member shall sign and date the material indicating<br/>only that he/she has received a copy of the material. The unit member shall not refuse to sign and date<br/>the document. The unit member shall have up to 30 calendar days to prepare a written response which<br/>will be placed in the personnel file attached to the materials.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person or persons who draft and/or place material in a unit member's personnel file<br/>shall sign the material and signify the date on which such material was drafted and when it was placed in<br/>the file.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall maintain the unit member's personnel file at the District's central office and<br/>shall keep a record indicating the persons who have requested and examined the personnel file as well<br/>as the dates such access was provided. Such log shall be available for examination by the unit member<br/>or his Association representative, if so authorized in writing by the unit member.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to personnel files shall be limited to the members of the District administration and<br/>Personnel Department on a need-to-know basis. Members of the District Board of Trustees may request<br/>the review of a unit member's file at a personnel session during a meeting of the Board. The contents of<br/>unit member's personnel files are to be treated in an appropriate confidential manner as prescribed by<br/>law.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member, or upon written authorization by the unit member, a representative of the<br/>Association, shall be permitted to examine and/or obtain copies of materials in such unit member's<br/>personnel file. The District reserves the right to charge for the cost of providing such copies.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>Voluntary Transfers</p>
<p>Unit members will submit, in writing to the Human Resources Department, their interest in<br/>openings which are posted by the Human Resources Department no later than the fifth working day<br/>following the date of the posting of position(s) by the Human Resources Department.</p>
<p>When the position is posted within the District, the educational and subject area needs of the<br/>school will be described in the posting.</p>
<p>Unit members will interview with the administrator and other appropriate personnel to<br/>determine the approval/disapproval of the request for transfer.</p>
<p>In all cases of voluntary transfers, if it is determined that two or more applicants are equal on<br/>the following criteria, seniority shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant has the proper credentials and/or qualifications for the position.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant shall have at least an overall satisfactory evaluation on the most recent<br/>evaluation and the applicant is not currently participating in a continuing employee<br/>assistance program.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant is qualified to teach students pursuant to the program requirements<br/>of the position and educational and subject area needs of the school.</p>
<p>Unit members denied a voluntary transfer will be notified by the appropriate administrator and<br/>provide the unit member the reasons for the denial of the transfer within five working days following<br/>the interview process. The final decision lies with the administrator.</p>
<p>Unit members will not be permitted to transfer voluntarily more than once in one school year.<br/>Exceptions shall be allowed upon mutual agreement of the District and unit member.</p>
<p>Involuntary Site Transfers</p>
<p>Involuntary site transfers shall not be punitive in nature. Involuntary transfers shall occur to<br/>accommodate:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in student population.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creation, elimination or reduction of programs and/or funding.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsuccessful documented interventions to resolve an employee issue.</p>
<p>In the event that an involuntary transfer of personnel is necessary, the appropriate<br/>administrator(s) will seek volunteers through a written communication to staff. If no volunteers are<br/>identified, one of the three least senior teachers that meet the qualifications set forth in the voluntary<br/>transfer article and causes the least disruption of students will be transferred. The final decision lies<br/>with the District. The District will provide support to the identified teachers to move files, supplies.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>equipment, etc. to the new school site(s) and will be sure that the new classroom will be clean and ready<br/>for occupancy.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who are transferred involuntarily from one site to another after the school<br/>year has begun shall be given three (3) days of release time for preparation for the new assignment.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have been involuntarily transferred from a school or position because of<br/>reduction in programs or services shall retain preferential right for 3 years to return to that position or<br/>school if a vacancy should occur for which that unit member is qualified as long as it does not unduly<br/>disrupt the overall district staffing.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide a place of employment which is as safe as the nature of the<br/>employment and assigned duties reasonably permit.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall notify their immediate supervisor in writing, or in the case of an<br/>emergency, orally, concerning an unsafe condition in the District directly affecting their physical welfare<br/>if they are aware that an unsafe condition exists. Their immediate supervisor shall investigate said<br/>reported unsafe condition, and advise the unit member of any findings and suggested corrected action.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District agrees to maintain in operative condition a communication system in unit<br/>members' classrooms and work stations.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members may use reasonable lawful force under the circumstances in order to defend<br/>themselves against an assault or battery which occurs within the scope of employment.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall immediately report cases of assault including threats suffered by them in<br/>connection with their employment to their immediate supervisor who shall report the incident to the<br/>police.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall maintain their classroom and work stations in a safe condition provided<br/>such conditions are within their reasonable personal control.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized Health Care Procedures.</p>
<p>1.

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school site shall develop a health care plan for each student who requires<br/>specialized health care (excluding routine medication administration) to insure<br/>that back-up providers are available when needed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pre-placement meeting shall take place at the local site with the employees who<br/>will be directly involved with a student who needs specialized health care services<br/>(excluding routine medication administration) to discuss the implementation of<br/>the specialized health care procedures.</p>
<p>*Dispensing medication, emergency injections, may be necessary activities for unit member<br/>during student field trips.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees not to conduct, authorize, or encourage any strike, work stoppage,<br/>slow down or refusal or failure to fully and faithfully perform job functions and responsibilities, or other<br/>concerted job action against the District during the term of this Agreement. The Association also agrees<br/>not to comply with the request of any other labor organization to engage in such activities against the<br/>District. In the event the parties reach impasse during re-opener negotiations, this clause will be<br/>inoperative for the duration of the impasse.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association also agrees that upon written demand from the District, to notify all unit<br/>members conducting any such unauthorized activities that their activities are not authorized by the<br/>Association and that continuation of such activities will make the unit members involved subject to<br/>discipline, up to and including dismissal, without the defense of the Association.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a provision or application be deemed invalid as described in Paragraph &quot;A&quot; above,<br/>the District shall reinstate any benefit reduced or eliminated to the extent allowable under the law, not<br/>to exceed the limitations set forth in this Agreement.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>During the term of this Agreement, the Association expressly agrees to meet and negotiate with<br/>the District with respect to compensation and issues covered in this Agreement, except for additional<br/>topics which are not currently within the scope of representation and which become mandated<br/>bargaining topics as a result of legislation, even though such subject or matter may not have been within<br/>the knowledge or contemplation of the parties at the time they met and negotiated on and executed<br/>this Agreement. Compensation issues may include, but are not limited to salary, health and welfare,<br/>class size, preparation periods.</p>
<p>This provision is not intended as a waiver of any lawful association rights to meet and negotiate<br/>over proposed district changes in unit member's negotiable terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall report to the Board at the second board meeting following each<br/>trimester all classes by school, grade subject, and teacher which are known to the Administration, that<br/>have exceeded desired class sizes the last 15 consecutive school days of the trimester.</p>

<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>A &quot;grievance&quot; is a formal written allegation by a unit member who has been adversely<br/>affected by a violation of the specific provisions of this Agreement. Actions to challenge or change the<br/>policies of the District as set forth in the rules and regulations or administrative regulations and<br/>procedures must be undertaken under separate legal processes. Other matters for which a specific<br/>method of review are provided by law by the rules and regulations of the Board of Trustees or by the<br/>administrative regulations and procedures of this school district are not within the scope of this<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>A &quot;day&quot; is a day in which the unit member is required to be at work.</p>
<p>The &quot;immediate supervisor&quot; is the lowest level administrator having immediate jurisdiction<br/>over the grievant who has been designated by the District to adjust grievances.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal written grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an<br/>informal conference with the grievant's immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level I: Within 30 days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the<br/>grievance, the grievant must present such grievance in writing on the appropriate district grievance form<br/>to the immediate supervisor. This written grievance shall be a clear, concise statement of the grievance,<br/>the Article of this Agreement alleged to have been violated, the circumstances involved, the decision<br/>rendered at the informal conference, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>The supervisor shall communicate a decision to the employee in writing within 15 days<br/>after receiving the grievance.</p>
<p>Within the above time limits, either party may request a personal conference with the</p>
<p>other party.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level II: In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I, the grievant<br/>may appeal the decision in writing on the appropriate District grievance form to the Superintendent or<br/>designee within 10 days following said decision.</p>
<p>This written appeal should include a copy of the original grievance, the Article of this<br/>Agreement alleged to have been violated, the decision rendered at Level I, and a clear, concise<br/>statement of the reasons for the appeal.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>The Superintendent or designee shall communicate a decision within 10 days after<br/>receiving the appeal. Either the grievant or the Superintendent or designee may request a personal<br/>conference within the above time limits.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level III: In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the recommendation(s) of the<br/>Superintendent or designee, the grievant may request the Association to proceed subject to the<br/>following conditions and procedures.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level IV (a) Arbitration</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 10 days after receipt of Superintendent's or designee's reply, the grievant,<br/>through the Association, may appeal the decision to final and binding arbitration. The appeal must be<br/>submitted to the Superintendent or designee in writing and indicate the grievant's intent to submit the<br/>grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the District and the Association cannot agree on an arbitrator within three</p>
<p>days, the District shall then request the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service to provide a<br/>list of seven arbitrators from which the parties shall strike alternately until only one name remains, with<br/>the first strike determined by a flip of the coin. The remaining name shall be the arbitrator. The cost of<br/>the arbitrator's services shall be borne equally by the Association and the District.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the<br/>issue or issues submitted to him/her. If the parties cannot agree upon a submission agreement, the<br/>arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written grievance and the answers hereto at each<br/>step. If any questions arise as to whether or not the grievance can be arbitrated, the question shall be<br/>ruled upon by the arbitrator prior to hearing the merits of the grievance. The arbitrator shall have no<br/>power to add to, subtract from, alter or modify the terms of this agreement or the written policies, rules,<br/>regulations and procedures or practices of the District. After a hearing and after both parties have had an<br/>opportunity to make written argument, the arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing to all parties.</p>

<p>The Peer Assistance and Review Program negotiated between the Central Teachers Organization<br/>and the Central School District is meant to provide assistance and review for teachers within the District,<br/>including but not limited to tenured teachers. It is the goal of both the District and the Association that<br/>we will be able to use the Peer Assistance and Review process to continue to support the growth of all<br/>teachers within the District in a manner which is both consistent with the legislation that created Peer<br/>Assistance and Review and is also consistent with past practice within our District. Such past practice<br/>has supported teachers through beginning teacher mentors, subject area mentors, staff development<br/>activities and encouragement to pursue advanced training such as the National Board for Professional<br/>Teacher Standards.</p>
<p>A. Joint Panel</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Peer Assistance Program will be administered by a panel. The panel shall consist<br/>of five members, two of whom will be selected by the District, and three of whom shall be classroom<br/>teachers with satisfactory evaluations, selected by the CTO Board. The panel will be chaired in the first<br/>year by a Teacher Representative, and in the following year by a member selected by the District. The<br/>chair will thereafter rotate on an annual basis between Association and District members.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association members of the panel shall receive release time necessary to perform their<br/>duties and/or an hourly rate of pay for meetings scheduled after the normal workday. (The formula to</p>
<p>be Step 1, Column 1 x .001). The panel shall meet at times and places as they shall determine. In no event<br/>shall the panel meet less than two times in a given school year.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All actions of the panel shall be taken by a consenting vote of at least five of the seven</p>
<p>members.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibilities of the panel shall include the following:</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All materials related to evaluations, reports and other personnel matters shall be<br/>confidential, subject to the following exceptions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to a subpoena or order of the court.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final report may be used by the District in any disciplinary action against the<br/>Referred Participating Teacher.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall defend and hold harmless individual panel members and Consulting<br/>Teachers from any lawsuit or claim arising out of the performance of their duties under this program.</p>
<p>B. Participating Teachers</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers may enter the Peer Assistance and Review Program in one of two ways: By<br/>being referred for having an unsatisfactory performance evaluation or by volunteering to participate.<br/>All Referred Participating Teachers will be notified by their principal at the time of the unsatisfactory<br/>evaluation. A teacher will be deemed to have received an unsatisfactory evaluation if they receive a<br/>&quot;U&quot; rating in any of the following areas:</p>

<p>All Referred Participating Teachers shall be ineligible for voluntary transfer while they<br/>remain in the program.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;Volunteer Participating Teacher&quot; is a teacher with permanent status who volunteers<br/>to participate in the Peer Assistance and Review program. The purpose of participation in the Peer<br/>Assistance and Review program for the Volunteer Participating Teacher is for peer assistance only, and</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>the Consulting Teacher shall not participate in a performance review of the Volunteer Participating<br/>Teacher. The Volunteer Participating Teacher may terminate his or her participation in the Peer<br/>Assistance and Review program at any time.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New teachers with Temporary or Probationary status shall also participate in the<br/>program. This participation is for peer assistance only and the Consulting Teacher shall not participate<br/>in a performance review of the new teacher.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Referred Participating Teacher will be assigned his or her Consulting Teacher by the<br/>Joint Panel. A different Consulting Teacher may be selected to work with the Referred Participating<br/>Teacher at any time during the process if it is determined that the goals of the program will be better<br/>served by this change.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All communication between the Consulting Teacher and a Volunteer Participating<br/>Teacher shall be confidential, and without the written consent of the Volunteer Participating Teacher,<br/>shall not be shared with others, including the site principal, the evaluator or the Joint Committee.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Referred Participating Teacher has the right to be represented throughout these<br/>procedures by the Association representative of his or her choice.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is anticipated that a Referred Participating Teacher will stay in the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review program no more than 12 calendar months from the first contact with the consulting teacher.<br/>However, the Referred Participating Teachers may, under special circumstances, remain in the program<br/>for a total of 18 calendar months, upon recommendation of the panel.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each participating teacher will have the opportunity to complete an anonymous survey<br/>of the consulting teacher prior to April 1<sup>st</sup>. These surveys should be delivered to the Peer Assistance and<br/>Review Chairperson.</p>
<p>C. Consulting Teachers</p>
<p>1. Selection: The Joint Panel shall select Consulting Teacher(s) who will assist participants<br/>in the Peer Assistance Program. The Consulting Teacher(s) will also serve as beginning teacher mentors<br/>and may also be assigned to provide staff development.</p>
<p>Consulting Teachers shall have the following minimum qualifications:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A permanent teacher of the District with at least five years of consecutive<br/>teaching experience.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demonstrated exemplary teaching ability, as indicated by, but not limited to,<br/>effective communication skills, subject matter knowledge, and mastery of a<br/>range of teaching strategies necessary to meet the needs of pupils in different<br/>contexts.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>District teachers may apply for a consulting teaching position by way of application, on a<br/>form prepared by the panel. Candidates must also submit three letters of recommendation, one from<br/>their current principal, one from a classroom teacher at a site where the candidate has worked, and one<br/>other of the candidate's choice. Based on a review of the application and the assessment of the<br/>principal, the panel will select candidates for an interview. Part of the interview process shall include<br/>the observation of each candidate at least once by at least one panel member.</p>
<p>2. As soon as practicable after referral to the program, the Referred Participating Teacher<br/>will be assigned a Consulting Teacher. The Consulting Teacher will then arrange a meeting, to be<br/>attended by the Consulting Teacher, the principal of the Referred Participating Teacher, and the<br/>Referred Participating Teacher. The employee's performance will be discussed as well as<br/>recommendations for improvement.</p>
<p>Based on these discussions, the Consulting Teacher will work with the Referred<br/>Participating Teacher to prepare an Assistance Plan which will list the goals and objectives for<br/>improvement. The panel will review and approve said plan, and provide such modifications to the plan<br/>as necessary.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the Consulting Teacher shall prepare at least three progress reports in the<br/>year of referral for the panel and shall appear before the panel to discuss the progress of the Referred<br/>Participating Teacher. The principal of the teacher should also be called upon to provide an assessment.<br/>The written Progress Reports shall be on forms approved by the panel and shall include an assessment<br/>as to whether the Referred Participating Teacher is making satisfactory progress and/or whether<br/>continued assistance is necessary.</p>
<p>For Referred Participating Teachers, the Consulting Teacher shall prepare a Final Report<br/>which will detail the progress made by the Referred Participating Teacher in meeting the needs to<br/>improve indicated on the evaluation which led to the unsatisfactory rating. The Final Report shall<br/>address any evaluations given to the Referred Participating Teacher while the Referred Participating<br/>Teacher is in the program. The Final Report shall be placed in the personnel file of the Referred<br/>Participating Teacher. The Referred Participating Teacher shall have the right of reply to all Progress<br/>Reports as well as the Final Report and that reply shall be appended to the report. The Final Report may<br/>be used by the District in any personnel decisions or proceedings regarding the Referred Participating<br/>Teacher.</p>
<p>The Consulting Teacher may bring a request to the Joint Panel for the participation of a<br/>psychologist or other mental health professional to assist the Consulting Teacher in the implementation</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>of the plan. The participation of a psychologist or other mental health professional must be approved by<br/>the panel and must reflect the budget and other guidelines established for these services.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term Limit: The Consulting Teacher cannot serve more than three consecutive years.<br/>After the third year the Consulting Teacher must return to the classroom for a minimum of one year<br/>before reapplying for the PAR Consulting Teacher position.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to the Classroom: At the conclusion of their role as Consulting Teacher, the<br/>Consulting Teacher shall have first choice of posted positions within the District for which he/she is<br/>qualified.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment</p>
<p>Teachers serving in the capacity of support providers may have a maximum of two BTSA<br/>teachers under their direct supervision, if they are currently employed as a full-time teacher. The<br/>stipend received for this service is $1,300 per BTSA teacher under the assigned BTSA support provider.</p>
<p>It is also agreed that additional costs associated with the BTSA program would be supported<br/>through the Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) budget, primarily for conferences, release time, and/or<br/>staff development. The PAR Committee will review this agreement on an annual basis.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>The District management, at its discretion, may fund Department Chairpersons, and reserves<br/>the right to cancel funding.</p>
<p>Department chairpersons will be responsible to the Middle School Principal.</p>
<p>The term of service will be one year with reapplication based on the ability to successfully<br/>implement performance objectives. Every middle school teacher interested in the position may apply<br/>and an interview will be given to each applicant. The interview panel will consist of the principal, two<br/>teachers, and others as deemed necessary. Teacher representatives for the interview panel shall be<br/>selected by the faculty.</p>

<p>The stipend for each position will be $1,000. The District may fund up to seven positions at<br/>each site.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>This agreement shall commence on July 1, 2013, and shall remain in full force and effect up to<br/>and including June 30, 2016; and thereafter shall continue in effect year-by-year unless one of the<br/>parties notifies the other in writing no later than June 30<sup>th</sup> of its request to modify, amend or terminate<br/>the Agreement.</p>
