<p>3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association shall have the right of access at reasonable times to areas in which<br/>employees work and the right to use faculty bulletin boards, faculty mail boxes, and<br/>equipment only for direct communication with the staff and to the extent that they do not<br/>interfere with school operations. However, this does not preclude the Association from<br/>using District computers to prepare a faculty newsletter to residents of the District.<br/>Reasonable times would be those times that a custodian is regularly on duty in the<br/>building.</p>
<p>3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elected officers of the Association and members of the Association Bargaining Team (a<br/>combined total of not more than seven (7)) may transact official Association business on<br/>school property at times not being used for planning for instruction, instruction, or<br/>conferences on educational matters with parents, students, other teachers, administrators,<br/>or Board members.</p>

<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of the Grievance Procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative<br/>level, proper and equitable settlements of grievances and to guarantee an orderly<br/>succession of procedures by which settlements may be achieved.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>A grievance is an allegation by a grievant that the grievant has been directly and</p>

This shall not preclude the Association, as<br/>a local representative of the Ross School certificated employees unit, from<br/>initiating a grievance on behalf of two or more unit members. This does,<br/>however, preclude the CTA/NEA from initiating or pursuing any<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>4.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Faculty/Board Panel is comprised of two Board members appointed by<br/>the Board, and two unit members appointed by the Association.</p>

<p>4.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant at the<br/>Informal Level, a formal grievance may be initiated.</p>
<p>4.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a formal written grievance is initiated, it must be filed with the<br/>Superintendent on the form provided by the District no later than twenty<br/>(20) days after the event or circumstances occasioning the grievance.</p>
<p>4.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A formal written grievance shall be a clear, concise statement of the<br/>grievance denoting the specific section of the Collective Bargaining<br/>Agreement in question, the circumstances involved, the decision rendered<br/>at the Informal Level, and the specific remedy sought.</p>
<p>4.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent shall communicate the decision in writing no later<br/>than ten (10) days after receiving the written grievance.</p>
<p>4.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure by a grievant to appeal a decision within ten (10) days shall be<br/>deemed an acceptance of the decision. Failure by the Superintendent to<br/>communicate the decision within the specified time limits shall permit the<br/>grievant to appeal to the next level without waiting for the decision.</p>
<p>4.5 Formal Level II</p>
<p>4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.1 If the grievant is not satisfied with the Level I decision the grievant may</p>
<p>appeal the decision within five (5) days to either the Board or the<br/>Faculty/Board Panel.</p>

<p>4.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant appeals to the Board, the following procedures will apply:</p>
<p>4.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than ten (10) days subsequent to receiving the appeal, the Board<br/>will ask the grievant to appear at a hearing at their next regular meeting.</p>
<p>4.5.4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board shall render a written decision to the grievant no<br/>later than the following regular Board meeting and the Board’s<br/>decision shall be binding on all parties concerned.</p>
<p>4.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievant appeals to the Faculty/Board Panel, the following<br/>procedures will apply:</p>
<p>4.5.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than ten (10) days subsequent to receiving the appeal,<br/>the Faculty/Board Panel will meet. The grievant and/or<br/>grievant representative may appear at the meeting.</p>
<p>4.5.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Faculty/Board Panel shall render a written decision to the<br/>grievant within five (5) days. A decision will require at least a<br/>three-fourths (3/4) vote of the Panel and shall be final.</p>
<p>4.5.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Panel fails to reach a decision, the grievance will be<br/>referred to the Board, and the procedures as outlined in Formal<br/>Level n, paragraph 4.5.3, will be applied.</p>

<p>6.4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time K-5 teachers shall have an annual average of at least ninety (90)<br/>minutes per week for preparation/planning/conference time when, in the opinion<br/>of the Board, a special program can be offered to students enabling teachers to be<br/>released from the classroom. The Board may in any year provide additional<br/>preparation time, which will not establish a practice which needs to be followed in<br/>any subsequent year.</p>
<p>6.4.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kindergarten instructional schedule will be determined by the District.

No teacher shall be required to remain in attendance at<br/>these meetings past 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator responsible for faculty meetings will provide an agenda before such<br/>meetings are held and permit teachers to place items on the agenda that will be discussed,<br/>time permitting, at the end of the meetings.</p>

<p>8.1.1.2 Accumulated Earned Sick Leave</p>
<p>If a unit member does not take the full amount of sick leave allowed in<br/>any school year, the amount not taken shall be accumulated from year to<br/>year and shall be credited toward retirement in the manner specified by<br/>law.</p>
<p>8.1.1.3 Sick Leave Use</p>
<p>8.1.1.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the unit member to notify the<br/>person designated by the Administration to acquire a<br/>substitute as soon as possible before his students are to<br/>report to class when he finds it necessary to be absent from<br/>duty.

<p>When a unit member has exhausted all available sick leave and continues to be<br/>absent on account of illness or accident for an additional period of five (5) school<br/>months, whether or not the absence arises out of or in the course of the unit<br/>member’s employment, the amount deducted from the salary due the unit member<br/>shall not exceed the sum that is actually paid a regular substitute employed to fill<br/>the absent unit member’s position or, if no substitute was employed, the amount<br/>that would have been paid to a regular substitute if one had been employed. The<br/>sick leave described in Section 8.1.1 and the five-month period described in<br/>Section 8.1.2 shall run consecutively. A unit member shall not be provided more<br/>than one five-month period per illness or accident. If a school year terminates<br/>before the five-month period is exhausted, however, the unit member may take<br/>the balance of the five-month period in the subsequent school year.</p>
<p>8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reemployment List</p>
<p>When a unit member has exhausted all the available sick leave described in<br/>Sections 8.1.1 and 8.1.2, and continues to be absent on account of illness or<br/>accident, and is not medically able to resume the duties of the unit member’s<br/>position, the unit member shall be placed on a reemployment list.

<p>The unit member on leave because of pregnancy disability shall be entitled<br/>to return to her original position, unless there has been a program change,<br/>or to a comparable position.</p>

<p>8.1.6 Personal Necessity Leave</p>
<p>A unit member may use up to a maximum of seven (7) days of accumulated sick<br/>leave in each school year for personal necessity.

The Participating Teacher’s signing of the report does not necessarily<br/>mean agreement, but rather that the teacher has received a copy of the report.<br/>The Support Providers shall submit a final report, which is the Support<br/>Providers’ final evaluation to the Panel.</p>
<p>1.4.4.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the Referred Participating Teacher’s participation in the TAP<br/>will be made available for placement in the teacher’s personnel file and shall<br/>be made available as part of the evaluation conducted pursuant to Article IX<br/>of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
