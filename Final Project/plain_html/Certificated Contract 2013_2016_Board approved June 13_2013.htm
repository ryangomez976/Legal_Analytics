<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>ARTICLE III: SALARIES</p>
<p>The Lagunitas School District is committed to giving all employees an<br/>opportunity to improve their salaries through a professional growth program which is<br/>designed as an incentive to improve job performance. Additionally, the District<br/>recognizes the value of experience by continuing, according to the adopted salary<br/>schedule, to award annual increases based upon the number of years worked in the<br/>District. There shall be Association representation on the District Finance<br/>Committee.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be paid according to the salary schedule for the 2012-13<br/>school year, attached as Appendix A. Appendix A may be amended in<br/>subsequent years as negotiated by and between the parties to the<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will provide year for year step credit for all verified credentialed<br/>teaching experience for unit members newly employed by the District up to a<br/>maximum of six years of full time teaching equivalent experience (or the<br/>equivalent sum of full time and/or part time experience).</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial placement on the salary schedule shall be based upon approved<br/>academic units and verified credentialed teaching experience in public or<br/>private schools.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will move one step on the salary schedule for each year of<br/>qualifying service for a maximum of 24 years, regardless of their full-time<br/>equivalency (FTE) in the district. Qualifying service is based upon the yearly<br/>contract that must be for at least 50% FTE.</p>

<p>In cases of uncertainty in records of the number of years of teaching<br/>experience, uncertainty as to whether various kinds of non-public teaching<br/>experience are creditable, and differences of opinion on similar placement<br/>matters will be referred to a Salary Placement Committee. The Salary<br/>Placement Committee will be composed of the Superintendent and one unit<br/>member who is appointed by LTA. Placement matters may be settled by<br/>unanimous vote of the two members of the committee. In other cases, a<br/>report will be made to the Board, who has the final placement authority.</p>

<p>7</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1,2013 June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>

Movement on the salary schedule<br/>related to the acquisition of professional growth units shall apply uniformly to<br/>all unit members within a bargaining unit and shall not exceed one column<br/>per year.</p>
<p>Eligibility</p>
<p>All unit members of the Lagunitas School District are eligible to<br/>participate in the Professional Growth Program. The program becomes<br/>effective on June 15, 1998.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>Professional Growth Unit (PGU)- as referred to in this Agreement<br/>means</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one semester credit from an accredited college or university (quarter<br/>units will be multiplied by a factor of two-thirds) or</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one unit as measured and verified on the basis of 15 clock hours of<br/>attendance, participation or work in a relevant professional activity.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clock hour refers to the actual time spent in the activity as verified<br/>on the “Certificate of Participation”</p>
<p>Verification- shall consist of documentation of hours or units on the<br/>prescribed Certificate of Participation included as Appendix D as<br/>submitted to the superintendent/designee.</p>
<p>Documentation- shall consist of a “Certificate of Participation” which<br/>must include college/university transcripts and/or a description of the<br/>course/activity, number of hours completed, date and instructor’s<br/>signature.</p>
<p>Release Time- for the purpose of this Agreement shall mean any day in<br/>which an employee is released from their regular job responsibilities in<br/>order to participate in pre-approved job-related professional growth<br/>workshop, conference or other activity.</p>
<p>Criteria</p>
<p>As professional growth is of mutual benefit to the employee, the District<br/>instructional programs, and the students, professional growth units will be<br/>granted for those academic and professional growth activities directly<br/>relevant to the unit member’s position and the District goals.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>Activities to be counted as PGUs shall be pre-approved by the<br/>Superintendent/Principal prior to taking the course and include, but not be<br/>limited to, the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses from an accredited college or university. Pre-approval is not<br/>required for upper division or graduate units.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in professional conferences and workshops, at lectures.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in curriculum development projects.</p>

<p>Procedure</p>
<p>Unit members shall submit requests for PGU approval to the District<br/>Administrative Assistant on the form prescribed by the District. All units<br/>which meet the criteria of the Professional Growth Program will be approved.<br/>Recognizing that some educational workshops are offered only during school<br/>hours, available funds for release time shall be pre-approved in an equitable<br/>manner. If the District has agreed in advance to cover the costs associated<br/>with a particular activity, that activity shall be eligible for Professional Growth<br/>consideration.</p>
<p>If a unit member receives a stipend from an organization other than the<br/>District for work completed outside of contracted hours or days, that time<br/>may still be considered toward achievement of Professional Growth Units<br/>subject to the criteria and procedures in this article.</p>
<p>Salary adjustments due to the accrual of PGUs shall be made once at the<br/>beginning of each school year. Unit members must submit verification of<br/>completion of approved professional growth activities by September 1 to<br/>effect a salary change at the beginning of that school year.

<p>10</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV: HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.75 to 1.0 FTE (full-time equivalent) entitled to fully paid benefits</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.50 to .74 FTE (full-time equivalent) entitled to pro-rated benefits.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than .50 FTE (full-time equivalent) entitled to benefits at unit<br/>member’s expense if they meet the requirements of the<br/>participating health care provider.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective July 1, 2005, cash in lieu benefits will only be available to unit<br/>members hired prior to June 30, 2005 who have participated in the cash in<br/>lieu program during the time they worked in the Lagunitas School District.</p>
<p>Any unit member who has opted out of the cash in lieu benefit forfeits any<br/>future participation in this benefit. Eligible unit members who have verifiable<br/>medical coverage through other means may opt for participation in an eligible<br/>403(b) IRS annuity plan. The District will provide $2475 in lieu of benefits.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the $2475 may be used by the unit member to purchase<br/>vision and/or dental with the balance remaining to be contributed<br/>towards an eligible 403(b) IRS annuity plan.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District’s contribution for the health and welfare benefits stated<br/>under the provisions of this Article is a monthly dollar amount<br/>contribution. The District will pay the premium of the lowest medical<br/>insurance provider for the unit member only. The medical program is<br/>the Kaiser Traditional 3 Tier program. For unit members with<br/>employee only coverage, the District will pay 100% of the Kaiser<br/>Traditional Program, vision, and dental. For unit members with<br/>Employee Plus One coverage, the District will pay up 72% of the<br/>Kaiser Traditional Program, vision and dental for member and one<br/>dependent. For employees with Family Coverage, the District will pay<br/>up 62% of the Kaiser Traditional Program, vision and dental for family<br/>coverage. Any amount above the monthly contribution shall be paid<br/>each month by the participating unit member through payroll<br/>deduction, unless mutually agreed otherwise during each year that<br/>this Agreement is in effect.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association recognizes that any further increases in the health<br/>and welfare benefit insurance premiums specified above are<br/>additional liabilities to the District’s budget and are a part of the total</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>compensation package during each year that this Agreement is in<br/>effect.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on Board-approved leave of absence shall have the option of<br/>continuing to be enrolled in all group insurance programs for the period of the<br/>leave of absence provided they pay the premium costs to the District.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who retire shall have the option of continuing to be enrolled in<br/>all available District insurance programs at the unit member's expense.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have left active employment shall have the option of<br/>continuing to be enrolled in all available District insurance programs at the<br/>unit member's expense for a period of one (1) year following the effective<br/>date of their termination, subject to carrier approval.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members whose employment terminates following the last day of the<br/>school year and before the commencement of the ensuing school year shall<br/>be entitled to group insurance coverage for July, August and September of<br/>that year.</p>

<p>The District shall deduct and transmit to the Association all authorized deductions<br/>from all unit members who have signed an approved authorization card for such<br/>deductions in a form agreed upon by the District and the Association. The written<br/>authorization for Association dues deduction shall remain in full force and effect<br/>during the term of this Agreement unless canceled or changed in writing by the<br/>employee.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI: GRIEVANCES</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “grievance&quot; is a claim by one or more unit members or the<br/>Association that there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or<br/>misapplication of a provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “aggrieved party” is the person or persons making the<br/>claim.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;party in interest&quot; is any person who might be required to take<br/>action or against whom action might be taken in order to<br/>resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A &quot;day&quot; is any day in which a unit member is required to render<br/>service to the District.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest<br/>possible administrative level, equitable solutions to the<br/>problems which may from time to time arise affecting the<br/>welfare or working conditions of unit members. Both parties<br/>agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the<br/>procedure.</p>
<p>Informal level</p>
<p>Before filing a formal grievance, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an<br/>informal conference with the Principal/Superintendent within 10 days after<br/>grievant or association knew of the act, or omission giving rise to the<br/>grievance.</p>
<p>Formal level</p>
<p>Level I</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days of the informal conference, the grievant must<br/>present his/her grievance in writing on the form prescribed by the<br/>District to the Principal/Superintendent. This statement shall be a<br/>clear, concise statement of the grievance, the specific section of the<br/>Collective Bargaining Agreement allegedly violated, the circumstances<br/>involved, the decision rendered at the Informal Level conference, and<br/>the specific remedy sought. Failure to file a formal grievance within<br/>specified time limits will invalidate the grievance. The Principal or<br/>Superintendent shall communicate his/her decision in writing within<br/>ten (10) days after receiving the grievance. Failure by grievant to</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1,2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>appeal a decision within ten (10) days shall be deemed as acceptance<br/>of the decision.</p>
<p>Level II - Mediation</p>
<p>In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the decision at Level I,<br/>the Association may appeal the decision and request that the<br/>grievance go to Mediation by completing the prescribed form<br/>Appendix C and submitting it to the Superintendent or his/her<br/>designee, within ten (10) days after receipt of the Level I decision.</p>
<p>Within five (5) days following the appeal, the Association shall so<br/>notify the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service<br/>(CSMCS). CSMCS shall schedule a mediation conference at the<br/>earliest possible date. Mediation conferences shall take place at a<br/>mutually convenient location and time.</p>
<p>Each party shall designate its representatives for the mediation<br/>conference. There shall be one (1) person from each party<br/>designated as spokesperson for that party at the mediation<br/>conference.</p>
<p>The mediator shall assist the parties in resolving the grievance. The<br/>mediator shall have the authority to meet separately with either party,<br/>but shall not have the authority to compel the resolution of the<br/>grievance. If, after due diligence, the mediator concludes resolution is<br/>not possible, the mediator shall notify both parties in writing.</p>
<p>The cost, if any, of the mediator shall be borne equally by the District<br/>and the Association.</p>
<p>If the grievance is not resolved satisfactorily to the Association through<br/>mediation, the Association, within ten (10) days of the final mediation<br/>meeting, may request binding arbitration.</p>
<p>Level III - Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties shall request a list of five (5) arbitrators from<br/>the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service<br/>from which the parties shall alternately strike names to<br/>arrive at the agreed upon arbitrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be in<br/>writing and shall set forth opinions and conclusions on</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>the issues submitted to him/her at the time of the hearing<br/>or in writing.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator, if made in accordance with<br/>his/her jurisdiction and authority under this Agreement<br/>shall be final and binding on the parties.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each party shall bear its own costs of advocacy. The<br/>expense or fees of the arbitrator and court reporter, if<br/>any, shall be shared equally.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to empower<br/>the arbitrator to make any decision amending, changing,<br/>subtracting from, or adding to the provisions of this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>Time Limits</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits provided for at each level shall begin the day<br/>following receipt of the grievance, grievance appeal or written<br/>decision.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as<br/>possible, the time limits specified at each level should be<br/>considered to be maximums and every effort should be made<br/>to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be<br/>extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be<br/>processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by<br/>the end of the school year and, if left unresolved until the<br/>beginning of the following school year, could result in harm to<br/>the aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein will be<br/>reduced by mutual agreement so that the procedure may be<br/>exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon as is<br/>practical.</p>
<p>Rights of Representation</p>
<p>A unit member, alleging a grievance, may be represented at all stages<br/>of the grievance procedure by an Association designated<br/>representative.</p>
<p>No reprisals</p>
<p>No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by any<br/>member or representative of the administration or the Board against<br/>any aggrieved party, any party in interest, any member of the</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1,2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>Association or any other participant in the grievance procedure by</p>
<p>reason of such participation.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association, either in its own behalf or in behalf of the<br/>affected teachers, may initiate a grievance which affects more<br/>than one teacher in the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the<br/>Association to investigate a grievance or attend a grievance<br/>meeting or hearing during the day, he/she will, upon notice to<br/>the Principal by the President of the Association, be released<br/>without loss of pay in order to permit participation in the<br/>foregoing activities. Any unit member who is requested to<br/>appear in such investigation, meetings, or hearings as a<br/>witness will be accorded the same right.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents, communications, and records dealing with the<br/>processing of a grievance will be filed in a separate grievance<br/>file and will not be kept in the personnel file of any of the<br/>participants.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals,<br/>making reports and recommendations, and other necessary<br/>documents shall be prepared by the Association and given<br/>appropriate distribution so as to facilitate operation of the<br/>grievance procedure.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may at any time present grievances to the<br/>District, and have such grievances mitigated, without the<br/>intervention of the Association, as long as the adjustment is<br/>reached prior to arbitration and such adjustment is not<br/>inconsistent with terms of this Agreement. If a unit member<br/>presents a grievance on his/her own behalf, the Association<br/>shall have the right to be present and state its views at all<br/>grievance meetings. The District shall not agree to a resolution<br/>of the grievance until the Association has received a copy of<br/>the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given<br/>the opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>ARTICLE VII: WORK YEAR</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher's work year shall consist of 187 workdays. As provided in<br/>Section 41420 of the Education Code, 180 of these days will be<br/>instructional days. Four (4) of the workdays shall be specified as teacher<br/>workdays for planning, preparation, record keeping, and in-service training.<br/>Three (3) of the workdays shall be specified as staff development days.<br/>Students will not be in attendance on the teacher workdays and staff<br/>development days.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that emergency conditions force the closing of school and<br/>instructional days are thereby reduced to a total below the minimum<br/>required by law, parties shall meet and come to an agreement on the<br/>specific dates to be employed for instruction in order to bring the total<br/>number of instruction days up to the minimum required by law. Except for<br/>this contingency, the work year shall not be altered except by mutual<br/>consent in writing of the parties of this Agreement.</p>

<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1,2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII: HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit members regular work hours shall be15 minutes before the start of<br/>instructional time to 15 minutes after the completion of instructional time. The<br/>time before school will be duty free except when circumstances arise to<br/>accommodate emergencies. The District and unit members recognize the<br/>need to spend hours beyond the normal day for professional duties such as<br/>preparation, planning, tutoring, and conferencing with students, parents,<br/>administration and other staff. Additional hours beyond the workday may be<br/>compensated. Every effort will be made to schedule IEP and/or Student<br/>Study Team meetings during the regular instructional day.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association recognize the importance of having unit<br/>members represented on District standing committees.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this section a “day” shall be any day a staff member is<br/>expected to be on duty as determined by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days in the CLB shall accumulate from year-to-year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days shall be contributed to the Bank and withdrawn from the Bank without<br/>regard to the daily rate of pay of the Catastrophic Leave Bank participant.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Catastrophic Leave Bank shall be administered by a three (3) member<br/>CLB Committee. The Committee shall consist of two (2) Catastrophic Leave</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>Bank unit members chosen by the Association and one (1) District<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>B. Eligibility and Contributions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All certificated staff members on active duty with the District are<br/>eligible to contribute to the CLB.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation is voluntary, but requires contribution to the Bank.<br/>Only contributors will be permitted to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who elect not to join the CLB upon first becoming<br/>eligible have a waiting period of 30 days after joining the Bank<br/>before becoming eligible to withdraw from the Bank.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution, on the appropriate form (Appendix F), shall be<br/>authorized by the staff member and continued from year to year<br/>until canceled by the unit member. The District will provide an<br/>authorization/cancellation form at the beginning of each school<br/>year in the contracts and benefit package.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancellation occurs automatically whenever a staff member fails to<br/>make her/his annual contribution or assessment. Cancellation, on<br/>the proper form, may be effected at any time and the staff member<br/>shall not be eligible to draw from the Bank as of the effective date<br/>of the cancellation. Sick leave previously authorized for<br/>contribution to the Bank shall not be returned if the unit member<br/>elects cancellation.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions shall be made between July 1 and October 1 of each<br/>school year. Staff members returning from extended leave which<br/>included the enrollment period and new hires will be permitted to<br/>contribute within 30 calendar days of beginning/returning to work.<br/>The District shall supply enrollment forms for the CLB to all new<br/>unit members and those unit members returning from leave.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of contribution by each participating member for<br/>each school year shall be one (1) day of sick leave which shall be<br/>deemed to equate to the legal minimum required by the Education<br/>Code 44043.</p>
<p>a. An additional day of contribution may be required of</p>
<p>participants if the number of days in the Bank falls below 30.<br/>This will be determined by the CLB Committee. Catastrophic</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>Leave Bank participants who are drawing from the Bank at the<br/>time of the assessment will not be required to contribute to<br/>remain eligible to draw from the Bank. If a CLB participant has<br/>no remaining sick leave at the time of the assessment, s/he<br/>need not contribute the additional day to remain a participant in<br/>CLB.</p>
<p>b. If the number of days in the Bank at the beginning of a school<br/>year exceeds 60, no contribution shall be required of<br/>returning unit members. Those unit members joining the<br/>CLB for the first time and those returning from leave<br/>shall be required to contribute one day to the Bank.</p>
<p>C. Withdrawal From the Bank</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLB participants whose sick leave is exhausted may withdraw from the Bank<br/>for Catastrophic illness or injury. Catastrophic illness or injury shall be<br/>defined as any illness or injury that incapacitates a staff member or a<br/>member of the staff member’s immediate family for over ten (10) consecutive<br/>duty days which requires the staff member to take time off work to care for<br/>that family member. If a reoccurrance or a second illness or injury<br/>incapacitates a staff member or member of the staff member’s immediate<br/>family within 12 months, it shall be deemed catastrophic after five (5)<br/>consecutive days. Thus, a unit member who used the Bank, after exhaustion<br/>of sick leave, for 25 days to care for her/his spouse who dies of cancer, and,<br/>after returning to work, suffers a heart attack, shall be demed to have a<br/>second catastrophic illness and may again withdraw from the bank after five</p>
<p>(5) consecutive days off work.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members must use all sick leave, but not differntial leave, available to<br/>them, as defined in this Agreement, to be eligible for a withdrawal from the<br/>Bank.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ten (10) days of illness or disability must be covered by the unit<br/>member’s own sick leave, differential leave, or leave without pay the first time<br/>said unit member qualifies for a withdrawal from the Bank. For subsequent<br/>withdrawals within twelve (12) consecutive months, the first five (5) duty days<br/>of illness must be covered by the unit member’s own sick leave, differential<br/>leave, or leave without pay.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member is incapacitated, applications may be submitted to the<br/>Committee by the unit member’s agent or member of the unit member’s<br/>family. Those agents will not be limited to those listed on the enrollment form<br/>(Appendix F).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1,2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals from the CLB shall be granted in units of no more than thirty<br/>(30) duty days. Unit members may submit requests for extensions of<br/>withdrawals as their prior grants expire. A unit member’s withdrawal from the<br/>Bank may not exceed the statutory maximum period of twelve consecutive<br/>months.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members applying to withdraw or extend their withdrawal from the CLB<br/>will be required to submit a doctor’s statement indicating the probable length<br/>of absence from work. Members of the Committee shall keep information<br/>regarding the physician’s statement confidential. A unit member’s withdrawal<br/>may not exceed the statutory maximum period of twelve (12) consecutive<br/>months.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member has drawn thirty (30) CLB days and requests an extension,<br/>the Committee may require a medical review by a second physician of the<br/>Committee’s choice at the unit member’s expense. The Committee shall<br/>choose only a second physician who qualifies under the unit member’s<br/>health insurance policy. Refusal to submit to the medical review will<br/>terminate the unit member’s continued withdrawal from the Bank. The<br/>Committee may deny an extension of withdrawal from the CLB. The<br/>participant may appeal any termination under the procedures outline below.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave from the CLB may not be used for illness or disability which qualifies<br/>the unit member for worker’s compensation benefits unless the unit member<br/>has exhausted all worker’s compensation benefits and her/his own sick<br/>leave. If the District challenges the worker’s compensation claim, the unit<br/>member may draw from the CLB, but upon settlement of the claim in the<br/>employee’s favor, the CLB shall be reimbursed the days by the District.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee may reasonably presume that a unit member<br/>requesting a CLB withdrawal may be eligible for a Disability Awarded or a<br/>Retirement under STRS or, if applicable, Social Security, the Committee may<br/>request that the unit member apply for disability or retirement. Failure of the<br/>unit member to submit a complete application, including medical information<br/>provided by the unit member’s physician, within twenty (20) calendar days of<br/>the request shall disqualify the unit member from further CLB withdrawals.<br/>Unit members shall respond to any requests for additional medical<br/>information from STRS or Social Security shall be submitted within ten (10)<br/>calendar days or the unit member’s receipt of CLB will cease. If denied<br/>benefits by STRS or Social Security, the unit member must appeal the<br/>decision or the entitlement to CLB benefits shall cease.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the CLB does not have sufficient days to fund a withdrawal request, the<br/>Committee is under no obligation to provide days and the District is under no<br/>obligation to pay the participant any funds whatsoever. The committee may<br/>choose to request an additional optional contribution from participating unit<br/>members. If the Committee denies a request for withdrawal, or an extension<br/>of withdrawal, because of insufficient days to fund the request, it shall notify<br/>the unit member, in writing, of the reason for the denial.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawals shall become effective immediately upon the exhaustion of sick<br/>leave or the waiting periods provided for in sections B.3 and C.4, whichever<br/>is greater. For example, if a unit member contributed when first eligible to<br/>contribute (section B.3) and had ten (10) days of accumulated sick leave<br/>when the illness began (section C.4) s/he shall begin withdrawing upon the<br/>eleventh (11<sup>th</sup>) duty day, if otherwise eligible. If the unit member had fifteen<br/>(15) days of sick leave at the beginning of the illness, s/he shall begin<br/>withdrawing days on the 16<sup>th</sup> duty day.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catastrophic Leave Bank member participants who are denied a withdrawal<br/>or whose withdrawal is not renewed or terminated may, within 30 work days<br/>of denial, appeal in writing, to the Executive Board of the Association. The<br/>Executive Board of the Association shall hold a hearing within fifteen (15)<br/>workdays. The Executive Board shall issue a confidential written decision in<br/>fifteen (15) workdays of the hearing. If the member’s incapacitation does not<br/>allow participation in this appeal process, the member’s agent or member of<br/>the family may process the appeal.</p>
<p>D. Administration of the Bank</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall have the responsibility of maintaining the records of the<br/>CLB and providing an annual report to the bargaining unit membership. The<br/>CLB Committee shall have the responsibility of receiving withdrawal<br/>requests, verifying the validity of requests, approving or denying the<br/>requests, and communicating its decisions, in writing, to the unit members, to<br/>the Association, and to the District. The CLB request form must include a<br/>specific waiver of confidentiality regarding medical/health issues and records.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee’s authority shall be limited to administration of the Bank. The<br/>Committee shall approve all properly submitted requests complying with the<br/>terms of this Article. Withdrawals may not be denied on the basis of the type<br/>of illness or disability.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants shall be reviewed and decisions of the Committee reported to the<br/>applicant, in writing, with ten (10) workdays of receipt of the application.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall keep all records confidential and shall not disclose the<br/>nature of the illness except as is necessary to process the request for<br/>withdrawal and defend against any appeals of denials. By October 5 of each<br/>school year, the District shall notify the Committee and the unit members of<br/>the following:</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any dispute between the Committee and the District as to the accounting of<br/>CLB days shall be immediately submitted to mediation without the need to<br/>follow earlier steps of the grievance procedure as per master contract.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Catastrophic Leave Bank is terminated for any reason, the days<br/>remaining in the CLB shall be returned to the then current members of the<br/>Bank proportionately according to their contribution.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XI: CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES' EVALUATION</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of evaluation is to support unit members in developing their<br/>skills in a supportive, cooperative atmosphere of lifelong learning, while<br/>maintaining high professional standards for teaching which:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insure student growth and development;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledge individual strengths;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Address the needs of the teachers with varying levels of experience;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on job specific skills.</p>
<p>Ongoing informal classroom visits by the administrator throughout the year<br/>will foster this atmosphere, and will compliment formal classroom<br/>observations. Administrators will work cooperatively to support unit members<br/>in their professional development.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be evaluated by the administrator utilizing the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession (Appendix G). By November 1<sup>st</sup>, unit<br/>members who are to be evaluated will meet with the superintendent or<br/>principal to set goals and establish an evaluation plan. The evaluation plan<br/>shall incorporate personal, district and/or program goals.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every temporary and probationary unit member shall be evaluated in writing<br/>at least once every school year no later that February 15. In the first year,<br/>the unit member will be evaluated on three of the six standards; and, in the<br/>second year, on the remaining standards (Appendix G). The selection of the<br/>standards shall be made in collaboration with the unit member and the<br/>administrator.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who, as a result of a District-initiated Reassignment of a<br/>Unit Member Requested Reassignment, is reassigned to a different program<br/>in the District will be evaluated in writing in the year that the reassignment<br/>becomes effective.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent unit members with less than 10 years teaching experience in the<br/>District will be evaluated in writing at least every other year no later than 30<br/>days prior to the end of the school year. Permanent unit members who have<br/>completed at least 10 years of teaching experience in the District, and who<br/>have met the standards during prior evaluation periods, may choose, in<br/>agreement with the administrator, to be evaluated every third year or every<br/>fifth year under the provisions of Education Code Section 44664. Unit<br/>members, regardless of whether or not they are on an evaluation cycle, shall<br/>meet with the principal annually at the beginning of the school year to<br/>discuss the unit member’s professional development for that year.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>Lagunitas School District<br/>Certificated Contract - July 1, 2013 - June 30,2016<br/>Board Approved June 13,2013</p>
<p>For the evaluation cycle, the permanent unit member shall meet with the<br/>administrator to identify two standards for evaluation purposes. Specific<br/>areas of focus shall be identified by choosing one to three key elements<br/>under each standard. If agreement cannot be reached in choosing the two<br/>standards, then the unit member shall choose one standard and the<br/>administrator shall choose one standard. The overall evaluation shall focus<br/>on the two standards designated in the planning session.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alternative to standard formal evaluation, the permanent unit member<br/>and the administrator may agree to use the alternative evaluation option.</p>
<p>The alternative evaluation option will be completed utilizing a form for that<br/>purpose developed collaboratively and piloted during the 2010-11 school<br/>year and approved by both the District and the Association. In the event that<br/>a unit member receives an overall unsatisfactory evaluation through the<br/>alternative evaluation process, that member will be evaluated in the following<br/>year utilizing the standard evaluation procedure.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who have received an overall unsatisfactory evaluation shall<br/>be evaluated annually until a satisfactory evaluation is achieved. It shall be<br/>the goal of the District and the Association to support individual unit members<br/>in achieving an overall satisfactory evaluation. A unit member may request<br/>an alternative administrator to complete subsequent evaluations. Areas of<br/>focus for the evaluation will include all areas determined as unsatisfactory in<br/>the prior year’s evaluation and/or other areas as determined by the<br/>administrator and the unit member. A specific plan for improvement will be<br/>completed by the administration and the unit member and will detail the basis<br/>for the evaluation, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resources provided by the District for mentoring, release time,<br/>professional development,</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the specific goals to be accomplished during the evaluation period</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the methods for gathering information and the specific information that<br/>is to be gathered,</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a timeline for completing the evaluation, including intermediate steps<br/>for observations, when information is due, when specific professional<br/>development activities will occur</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a list of who (administrator and/or unit member) is responsible for<br/>each step of the plan for improvement.</p>
<p>The plan for improvement will be written on a form for that purpose,<br/>developed collaboratively between the District and the Association during the<br/>2010-11 school year and will be incorporated into this agreement as<br/>Appendix I - “Plan for Improvement”. Repeated unsatisfactory evaluations<br/>may result in disciplinary action.</p>

<p>H. Personal and Academic Freedom</p>
<p>The Board of Trustees of the Lagunitas School District believes that<br/>academic freedom required the maintenance of a climate of intellectual<br/>freedom which encourages the flow of ideas with the recognition that this<br/>freedom implies both rights and responsibilities within the framework of the<br/>law.</p>
<p>Rights and Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit members, because of their training, experience, and<br/>commitment to teaching, have the responsibility of developing the<br/>curriculum in accordance with the laws of the State and the policies of<br/>the District.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controversial nature of a subject shall not bar its discussion in the<br/>classroom, so long as it is presented in an impartial and unprejudiced<br/>manner.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All reasonable effort shall be made to present all points of view<br/>regarding an issue so as to preclude the promotion of a partisan point<br/>of view.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic freedom is not an absolute. It must be exercised within the<br/>basic responsibilities of the teaching profession.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic freedom must be exercised with an understanding of the<br/>democratic tradition and application of good taste.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall be free from harassment or unwarranted inquiries<br/>regarding their personal beliefs or convictions. Their professional<br/>positions shall not be placed in jeopardy because of their scholarly,<br/>literary, or other artistic endeavors.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal life of a unit member is not an appropriate concern of the<br/>District for purposes of evaluation or disciplinary action unless it<br/>prevents the unit member from performing his/her assigned duties.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member shall be entitled full rights of citizenship, and no<br/>religious or political activities, or lack thereof, shall be used for<br/>purposes of evaluation or disciplinary action unless said activities are<br/>contrary to local, state or federal law.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be a single personnel file for each unit member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials in the personnel file of a unit member shall be made available<br/>for inspection by the unit member. Upon written authorization by the unit<br/>member, the Association representative may review the unit member's<br/>file or accompany the unit member in his/her review of the file.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members shall have the right to inspect and obtain a copy of<br/>personnel file material, upon request.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information of a derogatory nature shall not be entered or filed unless and<br/>until the unit member is given notice and an opportunity to review and<br/>comment thereon. A unit member shall have the right to enter, and have<br/>attached to any derogatory statements, his/her own comments thereon by<br/>filing such comments within thirty (30) days of the date of the derogatory<br/>statements. The review shall take place during normal business hours,<br/>and the employee shall be released from duty for this purpose without<br/>salary reduction. If the unit member alleges that the material is false<br/>and/or hearsay, a grievance may be initiated to determine the validity of<br/>such material. The material shall not be entered or filed unless and until<br/>such grievance sustains the material. In the event the District fails to<br/>comply with the provisions of this section, such materials shall not be<br/>allowed as evidence in any disciplinary action against the unit member or<br/>used by the District in any grievance filed by the unit member.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All material placed in a unit member's personnel file shall be dated and<br/>signed by the person who caused the material to be prepared.</p>

<p>Definitions</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reassignment is the movement of a unit member from one subject to<br/>another subject area, one grade level to another grade level, one<br/>program to another program, or from one configuration to another<br/>within the District</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vacancy is any position that does not have a unit member assigned<br/>to it.</p>
<p>Unit Member-Requested Reassignment</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A unit member may submit a request for a reassignment at any time, whether<br/>or not a vacancy exists. A unit member may also submit a request for<br/>reassignment subsequent to the posting of a vacancy notice.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request for reassignment shall not be denied arbitrarily, capriciously, or<br/>without basis in fact.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon knowledge of vacancies, the District shall deliver to the<br/>Association and post in all school buildings a list of all vacancies<br/>which occur during the school year.

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postings shall include the following: A closing date which is at<br/>least ten (10) working days following the posting and a job description.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a unit member applies for a vacancy, the following criteria shall<br/>be considered and weighed equally:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience and specific education relevant to the requested<br/>program position</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willingness on the part of the unit member to embrace the<br/>philosophy of the program.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator shall facilitate a meeting between each interested<br/>unit member and teachers in the program with the vacancy.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the positive recommendation of the administrator, the unit<br/>member shall meet with a reassignment committee composed of the<br/>administrator, all unit members in the program, and an equal number<br/>of program parents to unit members. One LTA representative, from<br/>outside the program in question, may also be on the reassignment<br/>committee as a non-voting member. The committee will use a<br/>consensus model in developing its recommendation. If consensus<br/>cannot be reached, the recommendation shall be made based on<br/>majority vote.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reassignment committee will make a recommendation to the<br/>administration who, in turn, will make a recommendation to the Board.<br/>The Board retains final authority in approving requests for voluntary<br/>reassignments.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a unit member’s request for a voluntary reassignment is denied, the<br/>unit member, upon request, shall be granted a meeting with the<br/>administrator to discuss the reasons for the denial. Following the<br/>meeting the unit member may request and shall receive written<br/>reasons for the denial.</p>
<p>District-Initiated Reassignment</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-Initiated reassignment shall be made only for the following reasons:<br/>decrease in the number of pupils which requires a decrease in the number of<br/>unit members, elimination of program(s) and/or funding, or school closures.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. If a reassignment becomes necessary, the following criteria shall be<br/>considered and weighted equally:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experience and specific education relevant to the requested<br/>program position</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willingness on the part of the unit member to embrace the<br/>philosophy of the program.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wllingness on the part of the program to accept the unit<br/>member.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal impact of the assignment on the District.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all factors are substantially the same, the least senior<br/>unit member will be selected for the vacant position.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XXII: SHARED CONTRACTS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unit members may take a part-time leave to pursue their education,<br/>travel, meet family responsibilities, and prepare for retirement;</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District and program needs be fulfilled.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligibility</p>
<p>All unit members are eligible to apply for shared contract positions. The<br/>Board of Trustees has the authority to approve or disapprove all such<br/>requests.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Application Procedure</p>
<p>Written requests for shared contracts will state, at a minimum, the<br/>duration of the proposed schedule for both unit members indicating:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific days/hours of instructional teaching, and</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific days/hours of attendance at sessions, parent conferences,<br/>and so forth. This written request will be presented to the<br/>Superintendent/-Principal</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a plan for the development of specific strategies and monitoring and<br/>implementation of lEPs.</p>

Both unit members sharing a contract will be required to<br/>attend the pre-school teacher work days and the first week of the school<br/>year.

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes Subsequent to the Issuance of Letters of Confirmation</p>
<p>If the unit member, after accepting a shared contract, requests a return to<br/>a full-time basis, the District shall attempt to honor the request, but shall<br/>not be obligated to do so.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringe Benefits</p>
<p>Shared contract unit members shall receive fringe benefits for the<br/>proportionate time they are teachers. Unit members may purchase fringe<br/>benefits through the group plan for the part of time they are on leave.</p>

<p>Shared contracts will be reviewed annually by the<br/>Superintendent/Principal and the participating unit members no later than<br/>March 1. Input from the teaching staff most closely interacted with and<br/>parents will be solicited by the Superintendent/Principal. Shared<br/>contracts may be renewed on an annual basis with the mutual consent of<br/>the Board, Administration, and the employees involved with a full<br/>consideration of the results of the review.
