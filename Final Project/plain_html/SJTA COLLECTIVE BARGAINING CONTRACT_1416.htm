<p>Article 1. CONTRACT PROVSIONS</p>
<p>1.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parties to the Contract</p>
<p>The Articles and provisions contained herein constitute a bilateral and binding contract<br/>(“Contract”) by and between the Governing Board of the San Juan Unified School<br/>District (“District”) and the SJTA/CTA/NEA (“Association”). This contract is entered into<br/>pursuant to Chapter 10.7, Sections 3540-3549 of the Government Code (“Act”).</p>
<p>1.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognition</p>
<p>The Board hereby recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative of the<br/>employees in the teachers unit described in Exhibit “A”, hereinafter referred to as<br/>“members” or “members of the bargaining unit.”</p>
<p>1.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savinas Clause</p>
<p>If any provision of this contract should be held invalid by operation of the law or by any<br/>final order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or by a final decision of the Public<br/>Employees Relation Board (PERB), the remainder of this contract shall not be affected<br/>thereby. In such an event, either party may request to reopen negotiations with respect</p>
<p>to the individual provisions.</p>
<p>1.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>District Policies and Procedures shall have no application to employees covered by this<br/>contract to the extent that the subject matter is covered to any extent by this contract.<br/>This statement shall not be construed to make any District policy or procedure subject to<br/>the Grievance Procedure provided by this contract.</p>
<p>1.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living Contract Partnership</p>
<p>The Association and the District agree that the collective bargaining process can<br/>promote a shared responsibility for resolving educational problems. The Association and<br/>the District recognize that problem solving requires a more open, flexible process, one<br/>that encourages participants to understand the interests of all parties, to think creatively<br/>about options, and to make decisions which conform to accepted standards of<br/>legitimacy. To maintain a trustworthy negotiations partnership, the Association and the<br/>District agree to use the Negotiations Teams Dispute Resolutions System described in<br/>Exhibit “M”, hereinafter referred to as “DRS.” The DRS will act as a guide for the<br/>Association and the District in the resolutions of issues. The Association and the District<br/>agree that the resolution of certain issues may extend beyond the term of the contract as<br/>set forth in Article 1.06.</p>
<p>1.06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Term</p>
<p>1.06.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two (2) year contract with re-openers on salary, benefits, and one (1) additional<br/>article per party in the second year (2015-16).</p>
<p>1.06.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than the first (1<sup>st</sup>) school board meeting in February, the Association<br/>agrees to present its proposals to the Board of Education for a successor<br/>contract. No later than six (6) weeks after the presentation of the Association’s</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>initial proposal, the District shall respond with its initial proposals and thereafter<br/>negotiations shall begin within ten (10) work days.</p>
<p>1.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution of Contract</p>
<p>The Association shall be responsible for distribution of the contract to all bargaining unit<br/>members.</p>
<p>1.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation in District Budgetary Decision-Making Process</p>
<p>The parties agree that the simultaneous considerations of collective bargaining<br/>obligations shall be integral to all future budgetary decision-making. The District and the<br/>Association shall be involved in the budget reduction and the subsequent budget<br/>development process. This process includes review of programs, expenditures,<br/>adjustments, budget priorities, restoration and overall implementation. The parties agree<br/>that the current budget reduction process shall be driven by the shared goal of minimal<br/>impact on quality teaching and student achievement, full consideration of expenditure<br/>alternatives, evaluation of decisions, reliable information, and open communication. The<br/>District will use a facilitator as appropriate, to be jointly agreed upon by the parties, to<br/>facilitate an on-going budget review process, including key points of review.</p>
<p>1.09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget Review Committee (BRC)</p>
<p>The BRC shall be charged with considering the current state of the District’s fiscal health<br/>as well as potential modifications in the current school finance system that improve or<br/>worsen the District’s fiscal condition. Those considerations include, but are not limited to,<br/>enrollment projections, expenditure patterns, fund balances, multi-year projections,<br/>funded revenue limits, modifications to the restricted income and expenditures of the<br/>District (e.g. the Governor’s Weighted Student Formula). Recommendations shall be<br/>made to the Board of Education and the Association for consideration. Discussion may<br/>include any relevant data or projections, program restoration, program modifications,<br/>compensation adjustments or budget adjustments to maintain fiscal solvency for the<br/>current, and subsequent two, fiscal years.</p>

<p>2</p>
<p>Article 2.</p>
<p>GRIEVANCE</p>
<p>2.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions</p>
<p>The following definitions control the meaning of the terms as used in this procedure:</p>
<p>2.01.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance is an allegation by one (1) or more members that a member(s) has<br/>been adversely affected by a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a<br/>specific provision of this agreement.</p>
<p>2.01.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Association grievance is a grievance alleging that a right of the Association<br/>has been violated.</p>
<p>2.01.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Grievant”—a member(s) or the Association filing the grievance.</p>
<p>2.01.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Work day”—a day when the administrative offices of the District are open.</p>
<p>2.01.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Immediate Supervisor”—the person at the lowest administrative level who has<br/>been designated management and who assigns or evaluates the work of the<br/>grievant.</p>
<p>2.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time Limits</p>
<p>Each party involved in a grievance shall act quickly so that the grievance may be<br/>resolved promptly. Every effort should be made to complete action within the time limits<br/>contained in the grievance procedure, but with the written consent of all parties the time<br/>limitation for any step may be extended. In the event a grievance is filed at such time<br/>that it cannot be processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end<br/>of the school year and, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school year<br/>could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein shall be<br/>reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or<br/>as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>2.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Discussion</p>
<p>Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any Member having a<br/>problem to discuss the matter informally with any appropriate member of the<br/>administration, and to have the problem adjusted without intervention by the Association,<br/>provided that the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of the contract. The<br/>member shall not be required to informally discuss the grievance.</p>
<p>2.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presentation</p>
<p>A member or his/her representative, or both, may present a grievance while on duty. On<br/>all grievances, two (2) designated representatives may participate in addition to having<br/>up to five (5) grievants or witnesses selected by the Association. Any increase in the<br/>number of witnesses beyond the above must be approved by the District. That approval<br/>shall not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p>2.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation</p>
<p>The grievant may be represented by the Association or any individual of his/her<br/>choosing at the informal discussion or at any step of the grievance procedure. If the<br/>grievant wishes to change his/her individual representative at any step of the grievance<br/>procedure, the grievant shall give twenty-four (24) hours written notice of such change to</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member who has taught five (5) years or more in the District and who<br/>has received all “Meets or Exceeds Standards” on his/her evaluation for<br/>the past three (3) years, but who chooses to use Option A, shall be<br/>formally observed at the principal’s discretion. In such event, all other<br/>guidelines in this section shall remain in effect.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each formal observation must be at least forty (40) minutes long and the<br/>evaluator must complete the Classroom Observation Form. The initial<br/>formal observation must occur no later than February 15.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two (2) working days prior to the initial formal observation, the<br/>evaluator shall schedule a pre-observation conference with the member.<br/>The conference and/or the two (2) day notice may be waived by the<br/>member in writing.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member shall be given a copy of the written observation report within<br/>ten (10) work days of the formal observation, an opportunity to discuss<br/>the observation with the evaluator, and an opportunity to attach to the<br/>observation report any comments that the member may wish to prepare.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a member receives an objectionable written observation report, he/she<br/>shall be entitled to not less than one (1) additional observation and<br/>conference other than those provided elsewhere in this section. Within<br/>five (5) work days of receiving the initial written observation report, the<br/>member may request, in writing, the additional observation and<br/>conference.

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An “Approaching Standards” column will be added to the form. The<br/>purpose of this addition is to distinguish between a serious deficiency and<br/>a slight deficiency. It should not be used to distinguish between someone<br/>who meets the standard and those who exceed the standard.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to the “Comment” section will be the words, “all responses<br/>checked Needs Improvement and Support to Meet Standards to be<br/>completed during or after the Post Observation conference.”</p>
<p>The Pilot Program shall be implemented across the District in the first full year<br/>following the ratification of the contract.</p>
<p>Inservicing of these changes will be determined jointly by the District and the<br/>Association.</p>
<p>3.02.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Classroom Observation Form used in the Option A process shall not be<br/>used for Option B.</p>
<p>3.03 Plans to Achieve Student Proaress/Professional Growth—Potion B</p>
<p>3.03.1 Description: The program is an individual exploration of alternatives to the<br/>traditional process of evaluation. The program is based on the premise that<br/>professional educators are capable of setting meaningful goals which will serve<br/>as a focus for their professional growth for that year. That individual’s<br/>professional growth becomes the focus for the evaluation for that year.</p>
<p>Participants are permanent members with a minimum of four (4) years of<br/>successful experience in the San Juan Unified School District.</p>
<p>Members must have demonstrated competence by receiving all “Meets or<br/>Exceeds” in the member performance areas of the Summary Evaluation during<br/>the previous four (4) years.</p>
<p>SJTA14-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</p>
<p>Members participating in the program are still responsible for meeting the current<br/>District standards of performance (see page 6, Part III of the Summary<br/>Evaluation instrument). Participation in this program is voluntary.</p>
<p>3.03.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants in Option B will adhere to the provisions of Exhibit “J” as modified,<br/>(e.g., change date of final evaluation to May 1, name for “Plans to Achieve<br/>Student Progress/Professional Growth—Option B”), including time lines and<br/>other provisions.</p>
<p>3.03.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrators may conduct informal observations as provided in Exhibit “J”.</p>
<p>3.03.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removal from Option B: A teacher may be removed from Option B upon<br/>admittance to PAR program or if the member does little or not work toward the<br/>agreed upon Option B goals. If a member on Option B fails to meet one standard<br/>and is not admitted to PAR, the administrator and teacher shall create an<br/>improvement plan for that single standard to be incorporated into the Option B<br/>goals for the following year.</p>
<p>3.03.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to Option B: A member may return to Option B after completing two (2)<br/>successive years of “Meets or Exceeds Standards” on the Option A Summary<br/>Evaluation.</p>

<p>3.04.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Summary Evaluation Form, or the computer generated form, shall be used<br/>for the evaluation of each member on Option A at least once each school year.<br/>The Professional Growth Plan Final Form, or the computer-generated form, will<br/>be used for the evaluation of each member on Option B at least once each<br/>school year.</p>
<p>3.04.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member’s evaluation shall be based on the member’s performance of<br/>instructional and non-instructional duties, and the member’s professional conduct<br/>within the scope of his/her assignment.</p>
<p>3.04.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any information used on evaluation forms, other than that obtained through<br/>observation by the evaluator, shall be identified as to source.</p>
<p>3.04.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member shall not be held accountable for any aspect of the education program<br/>or factors over which he/she has no authority or control.</p>

<p>3.04.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As appropriate, the member’s evaluator shall make specific recommendations as<br/>to how to correct any deficiencies noted in the Summary Evaluation Form.</p>
<p>3.04.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than April 1, the evaluator shall meet with the member to complete and<br/>discuss Part III of the Professional Evaluation Report.</p>
<p>3.04.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member may prepare and attach any comments he/she feels appropriate.</p>

<p>3.04.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substance of employee evaluations for competency is not arbitrable.<br/>Commentary alleging a disciplinable offense as defined in this agreement, if<br/>included in such evaluations shall be considered the same as a written warning.</p>
<p>3.04.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternate Year Procedures</p>
<p>During the alternate year, when no formal evaluation is being conducted, the<br/>member is not responsible for writing goals or meeting with the administrator at<br/>the beginning and end of year related to such goals. However, the alternate year<br/>status does not prohibit the evaluator from conducting informal observations. In<br/>such cases, it is the evaluator’s responsibility to communicate throughout the<br/>year with the member regarding any concerns related to their performance.</p>
<p>When an administrator determines that a consecutive year evaluation will be<br/>conducted, it is the responsibility of the administrator to notify the member(s)<br/>prior to the end of the previous school year. Such notification shall include<br/>purpose and rationale to support consecutive year evaluations.</p>

<p>3.05.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material of a negative or derogatory nature shall not be placed in a personnel file<br/>unless and until the member is given notice and an opportunity to review it and<br/>attach his/her comments thereto. Such review shall occur, upon the member’s<br/>request, during the member’s work day, without salary reduction. Upon request<br/>by the member, the Personnel Director shall review the appropriateness of the<br/>material.</p>
<p>3.05.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon written authorization by the member, a representative of the Association<br/>shall be permitted to examine and obtain copies of the materials in such<br/>member’s file.</p>
<p>3.05.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who drafts, receives, or places materials in a member’s file shall sign<br/>and date the material.</p>
<p>3.05.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member shall have the right to request the Personnel Director to place<br/>appropriate material of a positive nature in his/her personnel file.</p>
<p>3.05.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derogatory materials in a personnel file that are at least four (4) years old shall,<br/>upon an employee’s written request, be removed from the personnel file and<br/>placed in a separate sealed file.

<p>3.06.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any anonymous or unsubstantiated public complaint shall not be used in a<br/>member’s evaluation or included in a member’s personnel file. If the<br/>administration decides that a complaint received about a member is not serious<br/>enough to warrant a meeting with the member, subsequent evaluations shall<br/>contain no reference to the complaint.</p>
<p>3.06.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the administrator believes a complaint is serious enough to bring to the<br/>attention of the member, the member may request the administrator to schedule<br/>a meeting of the member, the complainant, and the administrator. If, in the<br/>judgment of the administrator, such a meeting would be counter-productive, the<br/>meeting may not be scheduled. The reasons for that judgment shall be given the<br/>member upon request. If no meeting is held, or if a meeting is held without the<br/>opportunity for the member to be present, subsequent evaluations shall contain<br/>no reference to the complaint.</p>
<p>3.07 Controversial Materials</p>
<p>3.07.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When complaints are received from citizens relative to the use of allegedly<br/>controversial instructional material which, in the judgment of the site/program<br/>administrator, are serious enough to adversely affect a member’s evaluation, the<br/>complaints shall be handled as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints shall be referred to the site/program administrator who shall<br/>review the complaint.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site/program administrator shall review the complainant with the<br/>member in question and shall attempt to resolve the issue at that level.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a resolution is not reached at this level, the complainant shall be<br/>requested to state his/her case in writing and shall be informed that the<br/>statement shall include the name of the member, date, place and full<br/>description of the episode or material in question and, in the case of<br/>printed material, the name of the author, title, publisher and objections by<br/>page and items or, in the case of other material, specific information in<br/>order to locate the objectionable phrase or aspect and any other specific<br/>information which might be pertinent. Upon receipt of the above, the<br/>site/program administrator shall review the complaint with the member in<br/>question and shall subsequently hold a conference with the complainant<br/>and the member in an attempt to resolve the issue at that level.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the issue is not resolved at the initial level, the matter shall be referred<br/>to the Superintendent/designee for resolution.</p>

<p>Involuntary Transfers</p>
<p>4.03.1 When an involuntary transfer, for the following school year, is necessary because</p>
<p>of school closure or excess staff, as determined by the pupil-teacher ratio in the</p>
<p>spring the following procedures shall apply:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than May 1, the site/program administrator shall notify the<br/>members affected and circulate a statement of tentatively determined<br/>surplus staff to each member at his/her work site. Thereafter a site<br/>member may, upon request, meet with the site/program administrator to<br/>make recommendations as to the identification of the surplus prior to the<br/>final decision.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring, the District shall determine which schools are to be affected<br/>no later than May 10.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than May 15, the site/program administrator shall circulate to<br/>each member at the work site a statement of tentatively determined<br/>surplus staff, and a list of all vacancies known as of May 10.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No later than May 15, a request for volunteers is to be made. Volunteers<br/>shall make their final intention known no later than May 19. Such<br/>volunteers shall be transferred as involuntary transferees.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members subject to involuntary transfer shall be ranked in order of<br/>district-wide seniority as a certificated employee. Members having the<br/>same hire date shall be ranked by lottery administered by the District in<br/>the presence of a representative of the Association.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary transfers shall be made by reverse district-wide seniority of<br/>members employed in elementary schools; by reverse district-wide<br/>seniority by department in middle schools; and by reverse district-wide<br/>seniority by department in high schools. The determination by seniority<br/>shall be subject to program needs of the school. Such a determination<br/>shall not be made without a basis in fact. A member shall be deemed to<br/>have seniority in the department in which he/she has the majority of<br/>his/her assignment. If the assignment is evenly divided, the majority<br/>assignment in the immediate preceding years shall control. A member in<br/>middle school or high school who is selected for involuntary transfer from<br/>a department may apply his/her seniority in another department in which<br/>the member had a majority of his/her assignment during the previous<br/>school year in that building.</p>
<p>For purposes of seniority pursuant to Section 4.03.1(f), a member<br/>assigned to a limited-term position (not to exceed two (2) years) shall<br/>remain in the department to which he/she was assigned immediately<br/>before.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall list all vacancies within the District known as of May 10.<br/>A copy of this list shall be sent to each employee subject to involuntary<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a position is left vacant by a member on paid leave or on District<br/>assignment, that position may be filled voluntarily by a surplus teacher for</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>the length of the paid leave or assignment. The surplus member’s rights<br/>under Section 4.03 of this contract, at the end of this period of service,<br/>shall be no greater nor less than they were at the beginning of the period.</p>
<p>If a position is vacant due to a one-year reassignment of a teacher, that<br/>position may be filled by a surplus teacher in the following manner:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacancy is for one year only behind a teacher who has return<br/>rights for the following school year.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a temporary assignment, the surplus member will not<br/>have rights to a position at the school if the teacher returns.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If another opening does not occur at the site through attrition, the<br/>surplus member choosing this assignment will be surplussed for<br/>the following school year.</p>
<p>i. The list of involuntary transferees in the spring shall be determined by<br/>district-wide seniority and composed of:</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members assigned after the current school year began pursuant<br/>to Section 4.03.5 or Section 4.03.6.</p>
<p>ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members unable to make a selection and assigned.</p>
<p>iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members identified for involuntary transfer in the spring of the<br/>current school year pursuant to Section 4.03.1.</p>

<p>a. The list of vacancies shall accumulate from May 1 until May 19. No<br/>vacancies shall be filled prior to May 19.</p>
<p>b. No later than May 20, the District shall send by certified mail to each<br/>involuntary transferee a list of vacancies known as of May 19. If those<br/>dates are not work days, the preceding work days shall be used.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members being involuntarily transferred shall be notified by certified mail<br/>of the time and place to appear, in order of their district-wide seniority, to<br/>make position choices from the list of vacancies accumulated through<br/>May 19. Each member shall select three (3) positions for which he/she is<br/>credentialed (under current state and federal regulations). At least two (2)<br/>must be in the same division to which the member is currently assigned.</p>
<p>If the member is not eligible for three (3) positions, he/she shall select as<br/>many positions as possible from the list. If the member selects in this<br/>manner, he/she shall be given one (1) of the positions so selected.</p>
<p>If the member is eligible for three (3) positions and selects fewer than<br/>three (3), he/she may be given one of those positions at the discretion of<br/>the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources or designee. Members<br/>shall be assigned by order of district-wide seniority with the most senior<br/>member assigned first and continuing in order of seniority, except as<br/>provided in Section 4.03.2(d).</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member who chooses to delay his/her selection or does not appear at<br/>the time and place, as notified pursuant to 4.03.2(c) above, shall be</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>placed by the District. This does not preclude the member from applying<br/>for any vacancies that appear subsequent to the surplus date. If the<br/>position for which he/she is credentialed reopens at the member’s<br/>previous school, the member has return rights pursuant to Section 4.03.6.<br/>Members placed by the district to a position at the end of this cycle shall<br/>have the option of placing themselves on the list of involuntary<br/>transferees the following spring.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positions not selected by involuntary transferees shall be made available<br/>to voluntary transferees and leave returnees, Section 4.06.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a voluntary transferee is not selected for one of these vacancies, it may<br/>be filled by a temporary employee with rehire rights. No position shall be<br/>filled by a new employee during this cycle.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any vacancies occurring after May 19 shall be posted, advertised, and<br/>filled by normal procedures.</p>
<p>4.03.3 August 1-First Teacher Workday</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member selected for involuntary transfer during this period shall<br/>appear at a meeting with the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources or designee prior to the first teacher workday.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These involuntary transferees shall be listed in district-wide seniority<br/>order and shall be assigned by the Assistant Superintendent of Human<br/>Resources, or designee, who shall make a reasonable effort to match the<br/>qualifications of each member to the available positions.</p>

<p>7.16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intent of the district to reduce class size using grade span adjustment funds<br/>provided by the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF). The parties agree that the<br/>following stipulations represent “a collectively bargained alternative annual average<br/>class enrollment for each school site” in accordance with the California Education Code<br/>42238.02(d) (3)(B)(i)(D). The provisions below shall supersede and replace current<br/>Article 7 K-6 requirements with each successive year of implementation. The parties<br/>further agree that for 2013-14 and 2014-15, Kindergarten through 3<sup>rd</sup> grade classes shall<br/>have a loading ratio of 30 students and a maximum class size of 31.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in the 2015-16 school year the parties agree to the following<br/>CSR/Grade Span Adjustment implementation for all elementary and K-8 schools<br/>up through self-contained 6th grade.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in the 2015-16 school year and after the 20th day of the school year,<br/>TK-1 classes will be loaded at 26:1 and shall have an average class enrollment<br/>for each school site not to exceed 26.50:1 and a maximum of 27.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in the 2019-20 school year, grades 5th grade shall have a loading ratio<br/>of 26 and a maximum of 29 students.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in the 2020-21 school year, grades 6th grade shall have a loading ratio<br/>of 26 and a maximum of 29 students.</p>
<p>If the 2015-16 LCFF Funding Gap Closure Rate, adopted by the legislature, is<br/>improved over the Department of Finance estimate as of November 1, 2014<br/>(20.68%) and results in additional net revenue to the district, the parties agree to review<br/>and discuss the effects in the Budget Review Committee. The parties furthermore<br/>agree that the Budget Review Committee shall give primary consideration to<br/>accelerating 2nd grade class size reduction for the 2015-16 school year. Priority for the<br/>acceleration of class size reduction shall be given to schools with the highest numbers of<br/>students eligible to receive supplemental funds.</p>
<p>Both parties recognize that because of the funding, the scale of the<br/>implementation plan, and the extended timeline, the CSR/GSA timeline may require or<br/>allow for adjustments. Therefore, the parties agree that the SJTA/SJUSD Budget<br/>Review Committee will convene annually to determine the feasibility of accelerating or<br/>slowing the implementation timeline and make recommendations for the full range of<br/>options.</p>

<p>Article 16. BARGAINING UNIT MEMBERS’ JUST CAUSE, DUE PROCESS AND<br/>PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>16.01 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>16.01.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article is to establish just cause, due process, and progressive discipline<br/>for disciplinary action affecting bargaining unit members. These provisions<br/>govern progressive discipline for all bargaining unit members short of dismissal<br/>or suspension in excess of fifteen (15) days.</p>
<p>16.01.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bargaining unit member will be disciplined, reduced in rank or compensation,<br/>nor otherwise subjected to adverse action as a result of alleged misconduct,<br/>without “just cause”, unless otherwise specifically addressed in this Agreement.<br/>Applicable standards of “just cause” are those promulgated by the American<br/>Arbitration Association, Department of Education and Training, herein included<br/>as Exhibit “H” to the Agreement. While conformance with such standards is an<br/>expectancy during all disciplinary considerations, satisfaction of such standards<br/>shall not constitute a “threshold issue” to a full merit’s review.</p>
<p>16.01.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties endorse the utilization of the Agreement and the contractual<br/>grievance and arbitration proceedings. Any alleged misconduct which can be<br/>remedied by progressive discipline must be remedied in accordance with this<br/>Agreement.</p>
<p>16.01.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District action to terminate any extra assignments remunerated on the<br/>Certificated Special Assignment Schedules (Exhibits D-5—D-8) beyond the<br/>employee’s regular classroom assignment shall not be reviewable under this<br/>Article. The District’s decision not to reemploy a probationary employee shall<br/>not be subject to this Article.</p>
<p>16.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual Protocols:</p>
<p>The District and the Association agree to conform to the following in order to provide</p>
<p>for fair, thorough and objective joint consideration in any proceeding.</p>
<p>16.02.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full good faith disclosure of known facts, circumstances, and evidence<br/>pertinent to any issue under consideration.</p>
<p>16.02.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diligent joint effort to effect appropriate confidentiality, proper interpersonal<br/>behavior, and objective communication during initial consideration and<br/>subsequent review of any disciplinary issue.</p>
<p>16.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions:</p>
<p>16.03.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation:</p>
<p>Upon request, bargaining unit members have the right to secure and utilize<br/>Association representation for any disciplinary considerations.</p>
<p>16.03.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right of Rebuttal</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall have the right to rebut any written warning or<br/>reprimand by following the procedures under Section 3.05.5.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>16.03.3 Acknowledgement of Receipt of Documents</p>
<p>The bargaining unit member shall acknowledge receipt of all documents intended<br/>for placement in his/her personnel file in the manner set forth in Article 3, Section</p>
<p>3.05 “Personnel files” of this Agreement. Notice may also be documented by<br/>utilizing certified, return receipt requested, mail to transmit true copies of<br/>documents to be filed.</p>
<p>16.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grounds:</p>
<p>16.04.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grounds for “progressive discipline” under this Article include, but are not<br/>limited to, the following dismissal categories derived from the California<br/>Education code:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immoral or unprofessional conduct.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dishonesty.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violation of or refusal to obey the school laws of the State or reasonable<br/>rules prescribed by the District.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasions of use of alcoholic beverages or other drug abuse which<br/>makes the bargaining unit member unfit to instruct or associate with<br/>children.</p>
<p>16.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levels of Progressive Discipline:</p>
<p>Progressive discipline shall function as a graduated system of penalties for continued<br/>infractions. (Exhibit “L”).</p>
<p>16.05.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administration of disciplinary action shall conform to the following progression:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informal Level</p>
<p>The parties believe that disciplinary questions and/or issues are best<br/>resolved by means of objective discussion between administrators and<br/>bargaining unit members. This may result in a verbal warning. This is the<br/>first level prior to formal discipline.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Level.</p>
<p>Refer to 16.06 for implementation of the levels listed below.</p>
<p>i. Written Warnings</p>
<p>Written warnings issued to the bargaining unit member constitute<br/>the first level of formal discipline.</p>
<p>ii. Written Reprimand</p>
<p>Written reprimands for placement into the bargaining unit<br/>member’s personnel file constitute the second level of formal<br/>discipline. The District must append to the reprimand any prior<br/>written warnings and/or reprimands which are to be relied upon<br/>for any purpose.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>iii. Suspension Without Pay</p>
<p>A second written reprimand for placement into the bargaining<br/>unit member’s personnel file, including suspensions without pay<br/>(not to exceed fifteen [15] working days), shall constitute the<br/>third level of formal discipline. The District must append to the<br/>reprimand any prior written warnings and/or reprimands which<br/>are to be relied upon for any purpose.</p>
<p>16.05.2 While progressive discipline levels may not be bypassed arbitrarily or</p>
<p>capriciously, it is mutually recognized that certain conditions warrant full or<br/>partial bypass of such levels:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains its right to suspend with or without pay in accordance<br/>with the California Education Code. In the event the District subsequently<br/>seeks to invoke formal discipline short of dismissal under grounds<br/>covered by this Article, such action will be governed under the provisions<br/>of this Agreement. If the District attempts to suspend an employee under<br/>the Code, and fails, the District is prohibited from attempting to impose<br/>any discipline under this Article for the same offense.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gross Misconduct” warranting immediate implementation of dismissal<br/>proceedings in accordance with the California Education Code.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious misconduct of such a critical nature that, in the evaluation of the<br/>Arbitrator, it justifies bypassing earlier levels of progressive discipline.</p>
<p>16.06 Procedures and Sequence Governing Implementation of Formal Discipline</p>
<p>16.06.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice to Member and Opportunity to Respond</p>
<p>If informal discussions (16.05.1.a) do not resolve the matter, prior to<br/>implementation of formal discipline, (written warning, written reprimand, or<br/>suspension) bargaining unit members will be provided with written draft of<br/>concerns, charges, and/or allegations along with pertinent circumstances/facts<br/>giving rise to such concerns, charges, and/or allegations within fifteen (15)<br/>working days after the circumstances/facts were known or should have been<br/>known.</p>
<p>16.06.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receipt of the written statement described immediately above, the<br/>bargaining unit member shall have ten (10) working days to obtain clarification<br/>and present a response if so desired.</p>
<p>16.06.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative Action</p>
<p>The administrator shall then have ten (10) working days to consider the matter<br/>and transmit a written decision to the bargaining unit member communicating<br/>his/her findings on the issues in the dispute, a disposition with reasons as to<br/>whether formal discipline should be levied.</p>
<p>16.06.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity for Full Review</p>
<p>Bargaining unit members shall then have the right to generate full review of<br/>formal discipline documents by initiating a grievance at Step 2 of the Grievance<br/>Procedure Article as included in this Agreement. From that point on, review will</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>occur in conformance with the timelines and procedures delineated in the<br/>Grievance Procedure and the provision of this Agreement. Review of written<br/>warnings terminates at the close of Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure. If such<br/>warnings are subsequently attached to reprimands, then they become subject<br/>to full grievance review with the reprimand.</p>
<p>An expedited arbitration process may be utilized when it is mutually agreed<br/>upon by both parties.</p>
<p>16.06.5 Formal discipline will be affected in conformance with the following provisions:</p>
<p>a. Written reprimands shall not be placed in a member’s personnel file, and<br/>suspensions shall not be implemented until the grievance procedure is<br/>exhausted, if the member initiated review under 16.06.4.</p>
<p>16.07 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitrator’s Charge</p>
<p>The Arbitrator is fully empowered to review formal discipline in accordance with<br/>provisions of this Agreement and the standards of just cause herein delineated.</p>
<p>16.08 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adverse Documentation</p>
<p>Adverse documentation may be removed from the personnel file, consistent with section</p>
<p>3.05.9 of this Agreement. Written warnings may be removed from the school file upon<br/>request of the member, if at least four years have passed without further misconduct.<br/>Such warnings will be placed in a sealed file and maintained in the District Office,<br/>separate from the personnel file.</p>
<p>16.09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding of Interpretation and Administration</p>
<p>The Association and the District agree that the “Bargaining Unit Members’ Just Cause,<br/>Due Process and Progressive Discipline” Article should be interpreted and administered<br/>consistent with the following understanding:</p>
<p>16.09.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That procedures and/or evidentiary documentation relevant to statutory<br/>dismissal proceedings are separate from the Progressive Discipline Article.</p>
<p>16.09.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the clause “reasonable rules prescribed by the District’ in the Progressive<br/>Discipline Article, Section 16.04.1.c includes, in addition to District rules, the<br/>rules contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</p>
<p>16.09.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That documents purged from personnel files in accordance with this Agreement<br/>will be sealed in envelopes and stored in a strictly confidential file. Access shall<br/>be limited to the Superintendent’s designee only for possible use in dismissal<br/>proceedings or in response to an official order.</p>
<p>Arbitrator’s findings concerning allegations in such documents shall be attached<br/>to the documents.</p>

<p>21.02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Development Teachers</p>
<p>For those teachers who have permanency in the early childhood education program and<br/>who the District determines to hire into the regular K-12 program, such persons will<br/>receive year-for-year credit on the regular salary schedule for each year in the child<br/>development program during which the member taught at least 15 hours per week for<br/>the full year. That person’s seniority will be determined by his/her first date in paid<br/>service as a probationary employee in the District’s child development program. The<br/>person will retain his/her permanent status.</p>
<p>21.03 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children’s Center Permit Teachers</p>
<p>21.03.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The director shall distribute a tentative calendar on or before July 1 or each<br/>year to all Children’s Center Permit Teacher (CCPT) unit members, and the<br/>CCPT unit member shall indicate their non-responsibility days and return the<br/>calendar to the director. The scheduling of non-responsibility days shall be<br/>mutually agreeable between the director and the teacher affected. In the event<br/>mutual agreement is not reached, the scheduling of non-responsibility days shall<br/>be made in the order of requests provided to the director, the scheduling of<br/>non-responsibility days shall be accomplished in an equitable manner, which<br/>means first-come, first served by program, if CCPT substitutes are available.</p>
<p>21.03.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two non-responsibility work days shall be scheduled on permit teachers’<br/>regular employment calendar. The scheduling of the days and the program<br/>activity shall be mutually agreed upon by the director and the member affected.<br/>In the event mutual agreement is not reached on the scheduling, the director<br/>shall make the decision based on the needs of the program. In the event<br/>agreement is not reached on the program activity, the director shall be</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>responsible for assigning the activity for one-half the time (either two half¬<br/>days or one of the two full days). The member shall be responsible for<br/>determining how he/she shall use the remainder of the time and shall submit<br/>a written plan in advance to the director.</p>
<p>21.04 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff Advisory Committee</p>
<p>The Staff Advisory Committee will continue to include a voluntary representative from<br/>the Preschool programs. The Director will continue to share program budget<br/>information at these meetings.</p>
<p>21.05 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future Considerations</p>
<p>The parties shall continue to address mutual interests. As these interests are reduced<br/>to contract language, they will become part of the collective bargaining contract<br/>through the regular procedures.</p>
<p>21.06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ECE Salary Schedule</p>
<p>The intent of this agreement is that all ECE members will be treated equally with regard<br/>to education, service/experience and education credits. No member shall be reduced in<br/>pay as a result of this consolidation. The new ECE Salary Schedule shall be identified as<br/>Exhibit F-1, effective January 1,2012.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the transition to full implementation of Exhibit F will be phased in<br/>over a maximum of 7 years. During the transition to exhibit F, affected members shall<br/>receive increases according to the following implementation rate until each member is<br/>compensated at the new rate.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2012-13, all ECE members will begin to receive training and professional<br/>development in the areas of “environment rating scales and common core State<br/>standards.” Additionally, a joint committee shall be formed to design the evaluation<br/>instrument for all ECE members in order to be consistent with the above criteria.</p>
<p>Exhibit F-1 shall be implemented according to the following annual schedule:</p>
<p>Effective January 1, 2012, a maximum of 7% of the total cost of the difference of an<br/>individual’s movement from Exhibit Fla or F-lb to Exhibit F-1, shall be applied<br/>retroactively to members affected. Each year thereafter, individual’s annual salary shall<br/>be increased at the rate of a maximum of 15% of the total cost of the difference of an<br/>individual’s movement from Exhibit Fla or F-lb to Exhibit F-1 through 2016-17, with<br/>18% in 2017-18.</p>
<p>However, the parties recognize that because of the uncertainty of funding, the scale<br/>mentioned above may not be sustainable. Therefore, the parties agree to convene the<br/>Budget Review Committee in 2013-14 (and each year thereafter), to determine the<br/>feasibility of the percentages mentioned and make recommendations for the full range of<br/>options for Exhibit F-1.</p>
<p>21.07 Involuntary Transfer Process</p>
<p>For the purpose of the Involuntary Transfer Process, the parties agree that ECE is a<br/>district-wide program. In the event a program or class is moved from one site location to<br/>another site location due to program approach or enrollment needs, and the unit<br/>member’s classification job title and job profile remain the same, the unit member in the</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>affected position shall move to the new site and maintain the same job title and job<br/>profile.</p>
<p>21.07.1 A member who is initially identified as affected, due to the Board<br/>approved reductions, or the closure of a program due to declining<br/>enrollment at an ECE site, or necessary program approach changes<br/>based on grant requirements, shall be identified as surplus staff.</p>
<p>Members shall be notified in writing of the time and place to appear to<br/>make their choice no later than 10 working days after Board Action.</p>
<p>Involuntary transfers shall be made by reverse district-wide seniority in<br/>job title at the site where the reduction is identified.</p>
<p>Members identified as surplus staff shall have an opportunity to choose<br/>from existing vacancies in district-wide seniority order with the most<br/>senior member choosing first. Under no conditions shall a member be<br/>required to take a position with reduced hours or pay.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members being involuntarily transferred shall be notified by e-mail of the<br/>time and place to appear, in order of district-wide seniority, to make<br/>position choices from the list of accumulated vacancies. Each member<br/>shall select two (2) positions for which he/she is eligible<br/>(credential/permit, and/or degree/unit requirements.) At least one (1) must<br/>be the same profile to which the member is currently assigned. If the<br/>member selects in this manner, he/she shall be given one (1) of the<br/>positions so selected.</p>
<p>If the member is eligible for two (2) positions and selects one (1), or does<br/>not meet criteria in a. (above), he/she may be given that position at the<br/>discretion of the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, or<br/>designee, or the District may pass.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member who chooses to delay his/her selection or does not appear at<br/>the time and place, as notified pursuant to section a. above, shall be<br/>placed by the District. This does not preclude the member from applying<br/>for any vacancies that appear subsequent to the surplus date. If the<br/>position for which he/she is eligible as defined above reopens at the<br/>member’s previous assignment location, the member has return rights to<br/>his/her previous assignment if it is reinstated or becomes vacant during<br/>the school year in which he/she has begun the new assignment. The<br/>member shall be notified by the District of the vacancy and the member<br/>shall declare his/her intention to return within three (3) working days of<br/>such notification. If the member returns to his/her previous assignment<br/>under this section, the member’s rights shall be the same as if he/she has<br/>not been involuntarily transferred. Members placed by the District to a<br/>position at the end of this cycle shall have the option of placing<br/>themselves on the list of involuntary transferees the following spring.</p>
<p>The parties agree that this involuntary transfer process language for ECE is for the<br/>2014-15 school year only and will automatically be an Article opened for the 2015-16<br/>bargaining session.</p>

<p>CREATING AND SUSTAINING A COLLABORATIVE CULTURE</p>
<p>24.01 Statement of Intent</p>
<p>The District and Association agree to take responsibility and be held accountable for the<br/>improvement of the quality of teaching and learning which represents an expanded role<br/>in public education. It is in the best interest of the San Juan Schools that the District and<br/>the Association cooperatively engage in activities and communication which<br/>demonstrate_mutual respect for all stakeholders and results in the improvement of<br/>student achievement through the development of common goals, a cooperative, trusting<br/>environment, and teamwork. It is the belief that actively and constructively involving all<br/>relevant stakeholders contributes significantly toward achieving these goals.</p>
<p>Shared responsibility and accountability for results are at the core of a continuous<br/>improvement model. Joint responsibility for student success means that educators share<br/>in celebrating what works and share in identifying together areas that are not working<br/>and are in need of improvement.</p>
<p>24.02 Recognition of Mutual Accountability</p>
<p>24.02.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District and the Association are responsible for sustaining a culture to<br/>support the continuous improvement model. They must continually articulate<br/>core values, reinforce the vision, and demonstrate their commitment to a new<br/>way of doing business. The continuous improvement process requires that the<br/>District and the Association support the needs of students, those who work in the<br/>classrooms and school administrators by providing the resources required for the<br/>planning, critiquing, and assessment of the work of teaching and learning. It is<br/>the shared responsibility of the District and the Association to build the capacity<br/>of each school to function as a learning community in which professional<br/>development is job- embedded and is supported with sufficient time and<br/>resources.</p>
<p>24.02.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the school level, administrators and the staff as a whole are accountable for<br/>establishing a learning community conducive to the best teaching practices and<br/>success for every student. They have a responsibility for managing time and<br/>creating opportunities that allow for collaborative problem solving and for using a<br/>wide range of data so that an environment conducive to analysis and<br/>improvement is created.</p>
<p>24.02.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the classroom level, teachers are accountable for the instruction they deliver<br/>and the classroom environment they create within which every student can<br/>succeed. Teachers implement the curriculum aligned with established measures<br/>of performance, state, and local standards, and where appropriate, international<br/>and national standards. The individual teacher will continue to receive training in<br/>obtaining and interpreting student data and will have the responsibility to use this<br/>data to examine his or her classroom strategies and systems.</p>
<p>24.02.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the District-wide level, school nurses and speech pathologists are essential to<br/>a comprehensive and cohesive student support system. School nurses and<br/>speech language pathologists shall establish elected leadership teams beginning<br/>in the 2014-15 school year. The purpose is to work collaboratively with school<br/>sites and the appropriate central office departments and to ensure a fully<br/>integrative system of medical and special needs supports. Topics shall include<br/>but not be limited to designing and receiving the ongoing professional</p>

On days when members are required to begin early or<br/>stay later due to presentations, school board meetings, and meeting the needs of staffs<br/>at school sites, members may adjust their starting and ending time accordingly by<br/>consulting with their manager. If a TOSA is assigned to a school site, the TOSA’s day<br/>shall be the same as other members on site, adhering to all sections of Article 8,<br/>excluding preparation time provisions.</p>
<p>25.06 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work Year</p>
<p>The 185 days are flexible, meaning that if the TOSA and his/her supervisor agree to<br/>additional days during the summer, an equal number of days shall become non¬<br/>workdays during the regular year. If there is no mutual agreement regarding the use of<br/>flex days, the supervisor may require up to ten additional flex days during the summer.</p>
<p>Effective the 2013-2014 school year, the parties agree to establish an extended work<br/>year pilot program for TOSAs through June 30, 2015. The work year for all TOSAs shall<br/>be 185 days plus five additional days at the member’s per diem rate for summer work.</p>
<p>25.07 Roles and responsibilities will include but not be limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan and deliver professional learning opportunities during the school year and<br/>during the summer.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model effective, research-based practices for teachers and administrators which<br/>then transfer to classrooms.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborate with school and district groups such as leadership teams, grade level<br/>or departments, English language instructional support and student learning.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursue professional growth opportunities as related to teacher support and<br/>student learning.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identify optimal resources which support school initiatives and assist in ensuring<br/>availability as needed.</p>

<p>AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S<br/>TEST APPLICABLE<br/>FOR LEARNING WHETHER EMPLOYER HAD<br/>JUST CAUSE AND PROPER CAUSE FOR DISCIPLINING AN EMPLOYEE</p>
<p>Few, if any, union-management agreements contain a definition of &quot;just cause.” Nevertheless, over the<br/>years the opinions of arbitrators in innumerable discipline cases have established a sort of &quot;common<br/>law&quot; definition thereof. This definition consists of a set of guidelines or criteria that are to be applied to<br/>the facts of any one case. These criteria are set forth below in the form of questions.</p>
<p>A &quot;no&quot; answer to one or more of the following questions normally signifies that just and proper cause did<br/>not exist. In other words, a &quot;no&quot; means that the employer's disciplinary decisions contained one or more<br/>elements of arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and/or discriminatory action to such an extent that said<br/>decision constituted an abuse of managerial discretion warranting the arbitrator to substitute his or her<br/>judgment for that of the employer.</p>
<p>The answers to the questions in any particular case are to be found in the evidence presented to the<br/>arbitrator at the hearing thereon. Frequently, of course, the facts are such that the guidelines cannot<br/>be applied with slide-rule precision.</p>
<p>THE QUESTIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the agency give the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable<br/>disciplinary consequences of the employee's conduct?</p>
<p>NOTE A - Forewarning or foreknowledge may properly have been given orally by management or<br/>in writing through the medium of typed or printed sheets or books of shop rules and penalties for<br/>violation thereof.</p>
<p>NOTE B - There must have been actual oral or written communication of the rules and penalties<br/>to the employee.</p>
<p>NOTE C - A finding of lack of such communication does not in all cases require a &quot;no&quot; answer to<br/>Question Number One. Certain offenses, such as insubordination, coming to work intoxicated,<br/>drinking intoxicating beverages on the job, or theft or the property of the company or of fellow<br/>employees, are so serious that any employee in the industrial society may properly be expected<br/>to know already that such conduct is offensive and heavily punishable.</p>
<p>NOTE D - Absent any contractual prohibition or restriction, the agency has the right unilaterally to<br/>promulgate reasonable rules and issue reasonable orders; and same need not have been<br/>negotiated with the union.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the agency's rule or managerial order reasonably related to the orderly, efficient, and safe<br/>operation of the business?</p>
<p>NOTE A - If an employee believes that the rule or order is unreasonable, s/he must nevertheless<br/>obey it (in which case s/he may, file a grievance thereover) unless s/he sincerely feels that to<br/>obey the rule or order would seriously and immediately jeopardize his or her personal safety<br/>and/or integrity. Given a firm finding to the latter effect, the employee may properly be said to<br/>have had justification for his or her disobedience.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the agency, before administering discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover<br/>whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?</p>
<p>NOTE A - The agency's investigation must normally be made before its disciplinary decision. If<br/>the company fails to do so, its failure may not normally be excused on the ground that the<br/>employee will get his or her day in court through the grievance procedure after the exaction of<br/>discipline. By that time, it is generally conceded that there has been too much hardening of<br/>positions.</p>
<p>NOTE B - There may of course be circumstances under which management must react immediately to<br/>the employee's behavior. In such case, the normally proper action is to suspend the employee pending<br/>investigation, with the understanding that (a) the final disciplinary decision will be made after the<br/>investigation and (b) if the employee is found innocent after the investigation, s/he will be restored to his<br/>or her job with full pay for time lost.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the agency's investigation conducted fairly and objectively?</p>
<p>NOTE - At said investigation, the management official may be both &quot;prosecutor&quot; and &quot;judge&quot; but s/he<br/>may not also be a witness against the employee.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the investigation, did the &quot;judge&quot; obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as<br/>charged?</p>
<p>NOTE It is not required that the evidence be preponderant, conclusive, or &quot;beyond reasonable doubt,&quot;<br/>but the evidence must be truly substantial and not flimsy or slight.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the agency applied its rules, orders, and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all</p>
<p>employees?</p>
<p>NOTE A - A &quot;no&quot; answer to this question requires a finding of discrimination and warrants negation or<br/>modification of the discipline imposed.</p>
<p>NOTE B - If the agency has been lax in enforcing its rules and orders and decides henceforth to apply<br/>them rigorously, the agency may avoid a finding of discrimination by telling all employees in advance of<br/>its intent to enforce hereafter all rules as written.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the degree of discipline administered by the agency in a particular case reasonably related to (a)<br/>the seriousness of the employee's proven offense and (b) the record of the employee in his or her<br/>service with the agency?</p>
<p>NOTE A - A trivial proven offense does not merit harsh discipline unless the employee has properly<br/>been found guilty of the same offenses a number of times in the past. (There is no rule as to what<br/>number of previous offenses constitutes a &quot;good,&quot; a &quot;fair,&quot; or a &quot;bad&quot; record. Reasonable judgment<br/>thereon must be used.</p>
<p>NOTE B - An employee's record of previous offenses may never be used to discover whether s/he was<br/>guilty of the immediate or most recent offense. The only proper use of his or her record is to help<br/>determine the severity of discipline once s/he has properly been found guilty of the immediate offense.</p>
<p>NOTE C - Given the same proven offense for two or more employees, their respective records provide<br/>the only proper basis for &quot;discriminating&quot; among them in the administration of discipline for said offense.<br/>Thus, if employee &quot;A's&quot; record is significantly better than those of employees B, C and D, the agency<br/>may properly give &quot;A&quot; a lighter punishment than it gives for the same offense; this does not constitute<br/>true discrimination.</p>

<p>EXHIBIT I</p>
<p>GOAL STATEMENT FOR<br/>ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM<br/>AND PREPARATION TIME<br/>June 7, 1990</p>
<p>The San Juan Teachers Association (SJTA) and the San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) mutually agree<br/>that the primary goal of SJUSD is to provide a comprehensive, high quality educational program for all<br/>students, which will prepare them for the 21st century by providing communication and computational skills as<br/>well as an understanding of themselves and of their cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Although we believe that the current program is admirable, given the limits imposed by budgetary constraints, it<br/>does not have sufficient staff and resources necessary to meet all our educational goals and the diverse needs<br/>of our student population. We believe that there are two conditions which would promote these goals: (1)<br/>specially credentialed teachers should be made available as needed to teach in specialty areas, and (2) time<br/>should be provided for the professional classroom teacher during the course of the school day to assess,<br/>evaluate, and coordinate his/her students' progress.</p>
<p>This joint goal statement by the SJTA and SJUSD outlines our vision of an improved educational program for<br/>elementary students and includes the necessary time for teachers to accomplish tasks important to quality<br/>education. We commit to work together to achieve these goals and to make this vision a reality. We hope that<br/>all elementary educators will contribute ideas to help refine plans, and, working together, we intend to achieve<br/>these goals by the 1993-94 school year. We will be exploring new sources of funding to support these efforts,<br/>as well as examining existing resources to address this goal.</p>
<p>During the transitional period from our current situation, all elementary schools are being asked to participate in<br/>the formulation of plans that will provide the currently agreed upon preparation time while working within<br/>existing resources. It is also important that these plans promote our joint goals to every extent possible.</p>
<p>PREPARATION TIME</p>
<p>A. GUIDELINES FOR PREPARATION TIME</p>
<p>To ensure the most efficient delivery of Prep, the Labor/Management Council has adopted the following<br/>guidelines to assist staffs who opt to utilize the services of paraprofessionals.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discipline</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be formal communication of those rules to staff (certificated and classified).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classroom teacher may be notified by the paraprofessional of student misbehavior.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrators shall provide to paraprofessionals the same level of support as would be<br/>provided to the classroom teacher.</p>
<p>The law requires that what occurs during the time the students are with a paraprofessional be directed<br/>by the teacher. Therefore, the activity for students selected by the teacher shall be related to and/or<br/>reinforce instruction being carried on in the classroom. It is not our intent that teachers be required to<br/>prepare elaborate lesson plans for this preparation time. The following activities are examples that the<br/>LMC believes would require minimal planning yet still qualify as instructional activities:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustained silent reading</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;map work</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading aloud/storytelling</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross-age (peer assistance - student-to-student research)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book talks (book fairs, author day)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selected library skills related to classroom objectives</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer activity</p>
<p>2. Scheduling</p>
<p>The principal and teachers should seek input from paraprofessionals regarding scheduling. The<br/>following should be considered during this process:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements for lunch and break(s), if applicable</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to complete job responsibilities that cannot be performed during preparation time<br/>(e.g., re-shelving books, clerical functions, re-filing disks, printouts of requested<br/>materials, planning with teacher, overseeing computer functions).</p>
<p>B. OPTIONS FOR SITE PLANS</p>
<p>The feedback from the schools raised some questions which we have attempted to answer below.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If enough schools were to provide credentialed specialist services in 45-minute segments,<br/>rather than the current 30, some funds could be generated that would then be available to those</p>
<p>sites.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that instrumental music could be folded into the prep delivery, but this will depend<br/>upon, among other variables, the local site having a sufficient number of students at the same<br/>level of instruction.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIP resources are for the purpose of improving/supplementing the instructional program. Prep<br/>time may result from that plan but should not be the purpose of the expenditure. (For example,<br/>the plan may call for the payment of additional time for the credentialed specialist, or a part-time<br/>specialist in science, math, etc., or additional aide time, which may result in prep for the<br/>classroom teacher.)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local plan that is developed must be submitted to the LMC for approval and/or any<br/>contractual waivers, etc.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site plan, once approved by the LMC, will be subject to the grievance procedure of the contract.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approval by the LMC of the site plans dos not waive negotiability of the prep issue, and the plans</p>
<p>themselves will be non-precedential.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>ELEMENTS OF A PLAN FOR SPECIAL DAY CLASSES</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labor/Management Council recognizes that there may be unique problems<br/>associated with providing a prep period for the special day class (SDC) teacher(s) at a<br/>given school. When developing the plan with respect to SDC teacher(s), the rights of the<br/>special education student and his/her parent/guardians with respect to the IEP and its<br/>implementation may not be violated, i.e., it must not violate any of the components of the<br/>IEP.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prep plan should be consistent with the provision of appropriate instructional time in<br/>each subject for all students.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing support service staff may be scheduled to provide appropriate pull-out services<br/>to the SDC students at the same time, thereby releasing the SDC teacher(s) from<br/>classroom duty (e.g., media techs, computer techs, instructional assistants, nurse,<br/>counselor, Miller-Unruh teacher, speech teacher).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDC teacher may team with another teacher (SDC teacher, resource specialist or<br/>regular class teacher) to provide a prep period for both.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All SDC students in a given class may be assigned to age- or grade level-appropriate<br/>classes during a common block of time.</p>

<p>153</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL GROWTH/EVALUATION - OPTION B</p>
<p>EXHIBIT J</p>
<p>GOAL - This evaluation program encourages members to continue their professional development and<br/>personal growth. The program offers to members who have consistently demonstrated a high degree of<br/>competence an alternative within the evaluation process. The program is flexible to encourage members<br/>to grow in self-chosen areas of interest that promote student learning, instructional leadership, and other<br/>student related outcomes. The program also hopes to strengthen collegial relationships and cooperation<br/>and to decrease member isolation.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION - The program is an individual exploration of alternatives to the traditional process of<br/>evaluation. The program is based on the premise that professional educators are capable of setting<br/>meaningful goals which will serve as a focus for their professional growth for that year. That individual<br/>professional growth becomes the focus for the evaluation for that year.</p>
<p>Participants are permanent members with a minimum of four (4) years of successful experience in the<br/>San Juan Unified School District. Members must have demonstrated competence by receiving all &quot;meets<br/>or exceeds&quot; in the member performance areas of the Summary Evaluation during the previous four<br/>years. Members participating in the program are still responsible for meeting the current District<br/>standards of performance (see page 6, Part III of the Summary Evaluation Instrument). Participation in<br/>this program is voluntary.</p>
<p>INITIAL GOAL SETTING CONFERENCE - The member develops goals that become the focus for<br/>her/his professional growth and evaluation for the school year. At a conference held early in the fall, the<br/>member and administrator meet to discuss these goals. These goals must be consistent with the overall<br/>educational vision of the school. The member and administrator establish the criteria and the option to<br/>be used for the evaluation of these goals (see goals form). They also need to schedule approximate<br/>dates for two interactive sessions throughout the year. The purpose of these brief sessions will be to<br/>discuss the member's progress on her/his goals.</p>
<p>Administrators are expected to make informal classroom visits (at least 4) to program participants in lieu<br/>of the single classroom observation required in the current evaluation process. It would be in the best<br/>interest of the program and the member/administrator relationship that at least the same amount of time<br/>be spent in these visits as was spent in the old observation process.</p>
<p>INTERACTIVE SESSIONS - One goal of the program is to decrease the isolation of members. The need<br/>for collegial dialogue about the practice of education and each member's goals is an important factor<br/>toward meeting that goal. Consequently, included in every evaluation option will be a plan of at least two<br/>scheduled interactive sessions throughout the year. The participants of these interactions may vary from<br/>member to member. Some possible activities that would meet this requirement include:</p>
<p>o Two meetings during the year with all the program participants from the school site. The<br/>professional growth/evaluation would be the sole focus of these meetings. They could, for<br/>example, include the principal, therefore satisfying the requirement of two member/administrator<br/>conferences that are part of this evaluation process for all participants.</p>
<p>o Members from different sites and even different grade levels could meet for regular, structured</p>
<p>interactions (see Collaborative Groups as an evaluative option). These members could discuss like<br/>curriculum (e.g., several mathematics teachers from high school and middle school) or just have a<br/>discussion on the progress toward completion of each of the members' goals.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>o Peer coaching or classroom visitations would meet the criteria for these interactions.</p>
<p>o The two scheduled member/administrator sessions could be sufficient to meet this interactive goal.</p>
<p>END OF YEAR SUMMARY CONFERENCE - Not later than May 1, the member and administrator will meet to<br/>review the member's work (see Professional Growth/Evaluation Final Form - 1993/94). The member will<br/>provide a written self-analysis on the progress toward meeting the established goals.</p>
<p>Included in this summary will be the member's evaluation of her/his goals, reflection on the goals' effect on<br/>her/his classroom performance and plans for subsequent growth. The administrator may provide her/his own<br/>written summary on the member's goals for that year and may also review the member's performance in<br/>meeting the district standards of performance. Continuation in the program is contingent upon the member's<br/>continued successful teaching experience.</p>
<p>EVALUATION OPTIONS - Members are encouraged to be creative in developing an evaluation alternative<br/>that will best support the member's goals. The following are only examples of the type of creative alternatives<br/>that members could incorporate in their plans:</p>
<p>o Member generated options - Members are encouraged to be creative in developing new or innovative<br/>options for use as evaluative tools.</p>
<p>o Collaborative groups - Participants will meet for regular, structured interactions between peer groups<br/>of inter/intra disciplinary or grade levels. The groups may focus on a particular educational growth area<br/>or curricular program. The groups will meet at scheduled times not only to discuss each member's<br/>personal goals, but to discuss commonalities in instruction or service.</p>
<p>o Portfolios - Portfolios will serve as a compilation of materials selected by the member to create a</p>
<p>&quot;photo album&quot; of progress made in meeting her/his goals. Sample items may include a log of activities,<br/>student work, examples of assignments or curriculum, photographs, video tapes or student evaluations</p>
<p>of activities.</p>
<p>o Peer coaching - A peer coach will be mutually selected by the member and administrator. The<br/>purpose of the peer coach is to provide focus through reflective feedback on progress toward<br/>completion of the member's goals. This will be accomplished through four to six meetings which may<br/>include pre-conferencing, observations, modeling and discussion.</p>
<p>o Action research - The member will select and outline a specific concept, instructional strategy or</p>
<p>learning theory to be researched and implemented. This will entail documentation of the in-depth study,<br/>practices implemented, and a determination of the validity of the concept researched. This may be<br/>completed in conjunction with graduate course work or mentor projects.</p>
<p>o Attendance and implementation of staff development strategies - The member may select a<br/>specific strategy presented through professional staff development programs. Focus will be on the<br/>implementation and evaluation of the impact of this strategy. A self-reflective journal may be used as an<br/>evaluation criteria tool.</p>
<p>o Modification of current evaluation process - A schedule of classroom observations focusing on the<br/>designated goals will be agreed upon by the member and administrator. Increased dialogue, pre and<br/>post conferences and self-evaluation by the member will receive greater emphasis than the written form.</p>

<p>JOINT COMMITTEES-HISTORY</p>
<p>EXHIBIT N-1</p>
<p>ARTICLE 3: EVALUATIONS</p>
<p>A joint committee will be convened to design and implement the California Peer<br/>Assistance and Review Program. Purpose of the committee is to develop a plan<br/>that meets the law and regulations relative to peer assistance and review. The<br/>district and SJTA agree to establish this committee with 4 representatives<br/>appointed by each part to convene on later than October 1, 1999. The<br/>committee shall complete their work and submit recommendations to the<br/>respective bargaining teams no later than February 1, 2000.</p>
<p>A joint committee shall be established to create new forms for aligning teacher<br/>evaluation with California Standards for the Teaching Profession and conduct<br/>joint training sessions. Joint committees will be established as appropriate for<br/>counselors, nurses, librarians and speech therapists.</p>
<p>Statement of Intent for Joint Committee’s Work on Teacher Evaluation</p>
<p>It is the deeply held belief of both SJTA and SJUSD that educators are<br/>professionals that continue to grow and improve in their craft throughout their<br/>career. All levels of experience and effectiveness deserve an environment in<br/>which to further their skills. The current model of evaluations does little to support<br/>this belief.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the interest of both SJUSD and SJTA to create a systematic, non-<br/>adversarial process that supports all educators in their ongoing professional<br/>growth. This new model will radically change the structure of what we now refer<br/>to as “evaluation.” This new process sees the teacher as a key participant, and<br/>will be practitioner-driven. The process will not be about a summative<br/>assessment of an educator’s worth, but ongoing formative assessments centered<br/>around practice. This process recognizes that educators operate in a continuous<br/>growth model, and that support for all educators is best delivered by fellow<br/>practitioners. The focus of this work is to benefit the whole, through collaboration,<br/>shared practice, and the deprivatization of the profession.</p>
<p>While this new process will continue to use CSTPs, it will also recognize the<br/>importance of using multiple measures to indicate success and growth. Among<br/>these measures, student success and learning will be an important marker of<br/>teacher growth. How student success and learning are defined will be one of the<br/>major charges facing the joint task force.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this work will reflect the following values:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educators are engaged in professional work that changes constantly.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members of SJTA bargaining unit (including teachers, nurses,<br/>counselors, librarians, etc.) deserve meaningful opportunities for growth<br/>through continual feedback from their peers.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educators that are struggling with their craft should never be left to the<br/>time-consuming practices of the past. While there is a firm commitment to<br/>PAR/BTSA by both parties, there is also acknowledgement that it was not<br/>designed to assist all teachers, at all skill levels, of the continuum.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All educators and students deserve ongoing support from our shared<br/>practice.</p>
<p>While the implications are far-reaching and the myriad of issues to be addressed<br/>too numerous to list here, we as the joint task force to begin with the following<br/>essential questions including:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will teachers be engaged to build ownership of teacher evaluation<br/>and performance management?</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will the system’s teaching and learning infrastructure need to evolve<br/>to support implementation of the teaching standards?</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What level of specificity and conformity are we trying to create through<br/>our teaching standards?</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we create a universal system, with the flexibility to promote<br/>continued professionalism, regardless of current expertise?</p>
<p>As agreed to by the Association and the District in the 2011-12 collective<br/>bargaining agreement, the parties agree to adopt the new revised California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession )CSTP) as the basis for the evaluation<br/>process. Due to the severity of the fiscal crisis, the parties agreed to postpone<br/>the implementation of the joint task force agreed in the 2011-12 collective<br/>bargaining agreement. The parties recommit to form a joint task force to develop<br/>a model of evaluations that allows educators to continue to grow and improve in<br/>their craft throughout their careers. The parties shall determine the composition<br/>of the committee and convene the group no later than November 1, 2012. (See<br/>statement of Intent above.)</p>
<p>ARTICLE 4: TRANSFERS</p>

<p>Joint Committee: The district and the association agree to use the existing joint<br/>special education committee and add members representing English language<br/>learner teacher/administrators to study the impact of special education and</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>English Language Learners on the regular teachers' classroom. The committee's<br/>analysis will include, but not be limited to review and federal and state special<br/>education mandates (including changes that de-emphasize student identification<br/>in the placement of special education student), the feasibility of weighted levels<br/>and Master Plan mandates for English Language Learners. The committee shall<br/>convene by August of 1999. Results of the committee's work, which may include<br/>recommendations, shall be made to the respective bargaining teams no later<br/>than February 1,2000.</p>
<p>Joint Committee: The district and the association agree to establish a joint<br/>committee to study the health and safety needs of P-12 students. The intent of<br/>the parties is to review short term and long term needs and solutions. The<br/>association president will appoint counselors, nurses, and P-12 teachers not to<br/>exceed a combined total of six (6). The district shall appoint no more than six (6)<br/>administrators. The committee will convene by May 15, 1999, and the results of<br/>the committee's work and any recommendations shall be made to the respective<br/>bargaining teams no later than April 1, 2000.</p>
<p>Joint Committee: The district and the association agree to establish a joint<br/>committee to study the effects of the current elementary specialists' class size at<br/>grades 1-3. The study will include the impact of the policy on student<br/>achievement and a cost analysis of reducing class size and possible non-cost<br/>adjustments. Progress of the committee's work and any recommendations shall<br/>be made to the respective bargaining teams no later than November 1, 1999,<br/>with a full report due by February 1,2000.</p>
<p>Within 60 days of the ratification of the contract, a joint committee (appointed by<br/>SJTA President and the Superintendent) will meet to make recommendations to<br/>the Superintendent regarding the number and placement of minimum days to<br/>accommodate elementary parent conferences.</p>
<p>By May 1,2000, a joint committee will be established to review the data and<br/>make recommendations to the bargaining team (7.09)</p>
<p>Counselors</p>
<p>School counseling programs should be an integral part of students’ educational<br/>environment. Counselors should be partners in the continuous efforts towards<br/>increased student learning, with increased emphasis and assignment in Title 1<br/>schools and those sites in low-income areas. Therefore, the parties agree to<br/>establish a joint committee that shall convene no later than November 1, 2012.<br/>Topics for discussion may include, but not be limited to, the following: ratios,<br/>building capacity for leadership and change, building a comprehensive<br/>counseling program, and common core standards and assessments.</p>
<p>Nurses</p>
<p>School nurses have a crucial role in the seamless provision of comprehensive<br/>health services to children and youth, recognizing the strong relationship<br/>between health and learning, particularly in our most vulnerable children in areas<br/>of poverty. It is also acknowledged that the nurse force in San Juan has been<br/>reduced by nearly two-thirds over the past decade due to dramatic decline of<br/>revenue and enrollment. Therefore, the parties agree to establish a joint<br/>committee that shall convene no later than November 1,2012. Topics for<br/>discussion may include, but not be limited to, the following: building capacity for<br/>leadership and change, caseloads of nurses-to-students, analysis of the needs of</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>the student population (e.g., number of students on free and reduced lunch,<br/>number of emergency services per year).</p>

<p>GUIDELINES FOR SHARED CONTRACTS</p>
<p>EXHIBIT Q</p>
<p>AS DEVELOPED BY SAN JUAN TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>May 27, 2005</p>
<p>The District and the Association have a common interest in recruiting and retaining employees,<br/>providing employee equity, and creating positive working relationships while maintaining strong<br/>educational programs for students. All parties recognize that sharing a contract at the elementary<br/>level meets those interests, but requires the teachers sharing the contract to work more than the<br/>shared amount in order to communicate and collaborate with their partner and the school<br/>community. The following guidelines become effective immediately to the extent practicable.</p>
<p>Items of Common Agreement for Eligibility and Applying for a Shared Contract</p>
<p>Eligibility</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants are permanent members.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must have demonstrated competence by receiving all “meets or<br/>exceeds” in the member performance areas of the Summary Evaluation during the<br/>previous two years.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The configuration of shared contracts shall be 50-50 or 60-40.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of shared contracts will not exceed 15% of the FTE’s at a school site,<br/>rounded to the highest (i.e. 15% of 10 teachers is 1.5 which would round to 2).</p>
<p>The principal may request that an additional shared contract be granted to meet<br/>site needs. This limitation on the number of shared contracts does not apply to<br/>those for medical or pre-retirement reasons.</p>
<p>Process</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligible members declare interest to share by notifying Human Resources from<br/>January 15 - February 15.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Resources Dept, will publish the list of eligible members with site<br/>locations, contact numbers, and interested grade levels. This list will be posted at<br/>each school site.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared contract meeting will be offered by the District and Association. FAQ<br/>and guidelines will be provided. Shared contract teachers and principals will<br/>provide input.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two teachers who wish to share a contract will develop a written plan and submit<br/>it to the site administrator.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties will meet to review and revise the plan.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrator will approve or deny the shared contract within ten working<br/>days of the meeting.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers have a right to request a written statement of reasons for the denial.</p>
<p>If a disagreement arises over the reasons indicated, the issue will be resolved by<br/>the contractual dispute resolution process.</p>

In collaboration with the<br/>principal, the parties may adjust their schedule to equalize their ability to<br/>participate in Collaboration Days. Both parties have the responsibility for the<br/>information shared on Collaboration Days.)</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faculty Meetings</p>
<p>-Partners shall share the attendance at faculty meetings as equally as<br/>practical. Both partners are responsible for information shared at such<br/>meetings.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calendar</p>

<p>SJTA1</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>Continuation of Shared Contract</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the year, the principal/teachers communicate concerns regarding the<br/>shared contract. Unresolved concerns should be reduced to writing.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By February 1, the team shall make every effort to declare their intention to<br/>continue or dissolve the shared contract.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By February 1, if there is mutual agreement by the team to continue, but the site<br/>administrator determines the concerns remain unresolved based upon the<br/>implementation of the written plan in the guidelines for shared contracts, the<br/>principal may deny the continuation of the shared contract.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers have a right to request a written statement of reasons for the denial.</p>
<p>If a disagreement arises over the reasons, the issue will be resolved by the<br/>contractual dispute resolution process.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the shared contract will not continue for the next year and the school does not<br/>have a vacancy to absorb an additional team, either partner may voluntarily place<br/>him/herself on the surplus list. In the absence of a volunteer, the least senior<br/>partner shall be placed on the surplus list.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one teacher in the shared contract leaves the school, the teacher who stays will<br/>be given the option of finding another teacher to share the contract and submitting<br/>a new plan to the principal for approval. If this cannot occur, the district may<br/>either assign a partner or the teacher will be offered a full-time contract if<br/>available. In the absence of these options, the teacher may take a leave of<br/>absence.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the school is required to reduce staff and a surplus occurs and either<br/>member of the shared team is least senior, the shared partners may surplus as a<br/>team or the least senior teacher in the share will be surplused in addition to the<br/>least senior member of the staff (1.5 FTE).</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an opening in a shared contract occurs mid-year, a temporary or probationary<br/>employee may work in the portion of the share which was vacant for the<br/>remainder of the year.</p>
<p>Program Review</p>
<p>The District and the Association will review shared contracts focusing on the</p>
<p>following:</p>
<p>-Did shared contract requests exceed the 15% limit?</p>
<p>-What data supports or does not support the effectiveness of the shared</p>
<p>contracts?</p>
<p>-Should anything be added to or removed from the guidelines?</p>
<p>-Should the maximum cap be increased?</p>

<p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING<br/>BETWEEN</p>
<p>THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>THE SAN JUAN TEACHERS ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>This Memorandum of Understanding is made and entered into this 30<sup>th</sup> day of January,<br/>2009, by and between the SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (hereinafter the<br/>&quot;DISTRICT,&quot;) and the SAN JUAN TEACHERS ASSOCATION (hereinafter the “Association”).</p>
<p>WHEREAS, the DISTRICT and the ASSOCIATION (hereinafter collectively “Parties”)<br/>are desirous of coming to an agreement and understanding concerning the manner in which the<br/>DISTRICT calculates seniority for its certificated staff.</p>
<p>WHEREAS Education Code section 44845 states:</p>
<p>Every probationary or permanent employee employed after June 30, 1947, shall<br/>be deemed to have been employed on the date upon which he first rendered paid<br/>sendee in a probationary position.</p>
<p>WHEREAS Education Code section 44918(a) states:</p>
<p>Any employee classified as a substitute or temporary employee, who serves<br/>during one school year for at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular<br/>schools of the district were maintained in that school year and has performed the<br/>duties normally required of a certificated employee of the school district, shall be<br/>deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary employee if<br/>employed as a probationary employee for the following school year.</p>
<p>NOW, TFIEREFORE, it is mutually understood and agreed upon between the Parties that</p>
<p>the aforementioned Education Code sections will be harmonized as follows:</p>
<p>1. When the DISTRICT confers probationary status upon a certificated employee who has</p>
<p>previously served the DISTRICT as a temporary certificated employee for at least 75 percent of</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>Exhibit U</p>
<p>the number of days of the immediately preceding school year, the seniority date of the<br/>certificated employee shall be the first date upon which the employee rendered paid service in<br/>the immediately preceding school year of temporary employment.</p>
<p>2. By way of example, but not limitation, of how the seniority methodology for certificated<br/>employees described and agreed to in paragraph 1, above, might be established, would include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a certificated employee is initially employed as a probationary employee, that<br/>certificated employee’s seniority date would be the date upon which he/she first<br/>rendered paid service.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee is initially employed as a temporary employee and serves at<br/>least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the DISTRICT were<br/>maintained, and is hired back as a temporary employee for the ensuing school year.<br/>During that second year of employment the certificated employee is made<br/>probationary. The certificated employee’s seniority date would be the first date upon<br/>which the certificated employee rendered paid service in the year immediately<br/>preceding the year in which the teacher was made a probationary employee.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certificated employee is initially employed as a temporary certificated employee<br/>and serves at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the<br/>DISTRICT were maintained. The following school year the certificated employee is<br/>hired as a temporary certificated employee, and works the entire school year as a<br/>temporary certificated employee. The certificated employee is then hired by the<br/>DISTRICT for a third year of employment as a temporary employee, but at some<br/>point during the third year is made probationary. The certificated employee’s<br/>seniority date would be the first date upon which the certificated employee rendered</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>Exhibit U</p>
<p>paid service in the year preceding the year in which the certificated employee was<br/>made probationary. In this calculation, only one (1) year of temporary employment,<br/>the year immediately preceding the achievement of probationary status, may be<br/>counted in calculating seniority.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASSOCIATION agrees to withdrawn Grievance #EER-CE-832 related to the manner<br/>in which the DISTRICT calculates seniority in the surplusing process for the 2008-2009 school<br/>year.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Agreement contains all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the parties<br/>regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes any prior Agreement, oral or<br/>written, and all other communications between the parties relating to such subject matter.</p>

<p>PROPOSED SIDE-LETTER AGREEMENT<br/>SITE-BASED MANAGEMENT TEAMS</p>
<p>The following agreement shall apply only to those sites with an active Site-Based Management<br/>Team in place as of July 1,2007.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Site-Based Management Team (SBMT) is to work with all the stakeholders<br/>at each site in designing the site plan. The bargaining unit members at each site are recognized<br/>as key stakeholders within the site-base process and as such shall be provided an opportunity<br/>to be active participants on the team. The composition of the SBMT shall be determined by the<br/>stakeholders at each site, but in no case shall less than 50% of the SBMT be bargaining unit<br/>members. Each stakeholder group shall be responsible for selecting their representative(s) on<br/>the SBMT. Although consensus is the preferred decision making process of the SBMT, if<br/>consensus cannot be reached, then 80% majority is required.</p>
<p>The approval of the site plan by the stakeholders shall follow the guideline developed at each<br/>site by the SBMT. Although consensus is the preferred decision-making process, if consensus<br/>cannot be reached, an alternative process requiring 70% of the identified stakeholders voting in<br/>each group shall be required for approval of the plan prior to submission to the Board of<br/>Education for final approval.</p>
<p>It is not the intent of the site-based management process to violate the contractual rights of unit<br/>members. If any aspect of a proposed plan is contrary to the terms of the collective bargaining<br/>agreement, an approval must be obtained from the Association and the Board of Education. If<br/>such an amendment is recommended by the SBMT and approved as part of the site plan, and if<br/>approved by the District and the Association, it shall be part of the collective bargaining<br/>agreement for a specific period of time, for a specific work site and applies to all certificated<br/>members at the site.</p>

<p>Statement of Intent</p>
<p>The San Juan Unified School District and the San Juan Teachers<br/>Association agree that San Juan High School will be a location for<br/>research and development of best practices for high school education<br/>reform. We will invest talent, time and resources to develop structures,<br/>processes and practices that are most effective for the students of San<br/>Juan High School and San Juan Unified School District.

<p>We are open to innovation and experimentation while maintaining many<br/>valuable high school experiences and rigor of the California State Content<br/>Standards of a complete high school. The school’s schedule will allow<br/>students to take courses at San Juan High School, American River College<br/>and in an online setting. Students wiii engage in a course of study that<br/>blends career, high school and college academics, which will lead to<br/>multiple pathways after graduation. The culture of the school will<br/>promote 21<sup>st</sup> Century workplace skills, civic responsibility, and positive<br/>social behavior. San Juan High School will be the home of innovation as<br/>we seek to change high school education from the industrial model to the<br/>21<sup>st</sup> Century Learning for a Global Society.</p>
<p>This is our work. This is our commitment.</p>

<p>As compensation for added responsibilities and time (longer day, longer work year)<br/>associated with completely transforming Encina to a 6-12 school and being a recipient of<br/>a Federal School Improvement Grant, all unit members will have their base<br/>compensation increased by $5,000 for the school years 2011-12 and 2012-13. Efforts<br/>will continue to be made to sustain this additional compensation and time through<br/>appropriate federal and state categorical monies and other foundation grants.</p>
<p>However, this additional compensation cannot be guaranteed beyond the life of SIG<br/>monies that ends in 2012-13.</p>
<p>Work Year Calendar</p>
<p>In order to prepare for the dramatic changes that will be implemented next fall and<br/>throughout the school year, all Encina staff, who have not elected to opt out Encina for<br/>the 2011-12 school year, will be required to report to work on June 13 and June 14,</p>
<p>2011, to begin the work of planning the implementation phase for the next school year.<br/>Compensation for June 13 and 14 will be at the member's daily rate of pay and separate<br/>from the stipend as it falls within the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Also, as part of the $5,000 stipend, all staff members will be required to start the new<br/>school year on August s, 2011. Due to the late notice of this timeline, members that<br/>have previous commitments, that If changed would create unnecessary hardship, will<br/>notify the principal and may be excused with one's stipend to be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>Additionally, staff members are expected during the summer to take on a reasonable<br/>amount of work related to the start up next fall. These assignments, which will evolve<br/>naturally out of the initiatives outlined in the design's team Interim Report, will be<br/>determined by the staff over the course of the two additional days, June 13 and 14. The<br/>start date for the 2012-13 school year is tentatively scheduled for August 6, 2012.</p>
<p>Teacher Work Day</p>

<p>Governance Structure/Leadership Team</p>
<p>1) As previously agreed to by the parties, the Design Team's service will conclude<br/>no later than May 30, 2011. The current School Leadership Team will assume the<br/>responsibility for carrying out the Design Team's work and fulfilling the requirements of<br/>the School Improvement Grant for the 2011-12 school year. Terms for individuals that<br/>are due to expire shall be extended one year for the purpose of continuity and stability.<br/>All positions on the School Leadership Team, including the two additional 6-8<sup>th</sup> grade<br/>positions (referenced in #3 below), will be up for re-election in the spring of 2012. All<br/>other provisions of Article 24 remain in force unless otherwise stipulated in this<br/>agreement, which includes the Design Team's Interim Report.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>

<p>Exhibit Y</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that the vision expressed in the Design Team's Interim Report<br/>may configure and distribute leadership and responsibility differently than the original<br/>intent of Article 24. Therefore, waivers may be granted for the 2011-12 school year.<br/>The parties agree to review this section in the spring of 2012 and consider necessary<br/>modifications based upon recommendations of the Leadership Team and staff.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the addition of grades 6-8, two members who teach the middle years<br/>program will be added to the current Leadership Team of six bringing the total number<br/>to eight, which includes the principal and one vice principal. Selection to the team for<br/>the upcoming year 2011-12, will be through an application process. The two additional<br/>members shall be interviewed and selected by the current school Leadership Team.</p>
<p>Each member of the team shall have an equal voice. The preferable decision-making<br/>process shall be by consensus. Absent consensus, a majority vote shall prevail. Once<br/>the school Leadership Team is complete, they will be responsible for hiring new staff.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacancies on the current Leadership Team that occur due to utilizing the opt-out<br/>clause of this agreement shall be filled by the normal secret ballot election procedures<br/>no later than May 27, 2011.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificated employees who wish to be considered for any vacancies will submit<br/>an application form, which will indicate whether the applicant wants to be considered<br/>for both the staff and the Leadership Team or only for the staff at large. All<br/>probationary and permanent certificated employees with appropriate credentials,<br/>except those who have received final layoff notices (May 15), are eligible to apply. All<br/>applicants will receive this agreement and any appendices prior to the interview<br/>process.</p>
<p>Certificated Evaluation</p>
<p>All certificated staff, except those with temporary or probationary status, shall utilize<br/>the Option B process outlined in the current collective bargaining agreement. Ail other<br/>provisions of Article 3 remain in force.</p>
<p>Transfer</p>
<p>The parties agree that recruiting and maintaining staff that are committed to Encina's<br/>transformation process is in the best interests of the students, faculty, and overall<br/>success of the school. Therefore, it is agreed that Article 4 shall be modified tD allow<br/>staff members of Encina to opt-out and be reassigned to another site by voluntarily<br/>placing themselves on the surplus list, pursuant to Section 4.3, for the spring of 2011.</p>
<p>Dispute Resolution Process</p>
<p>Encina's mission to create a shared leadership and governance model will place<br/>additional responsibility on every staff member. This is radically different from<br/>traditional models that are hierarchical and autocratic. Conflicts that are usually<br/>avoided or swept under the rug will now need to rise to the surface. A fair dispute</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>resolution process allows problems to be admitted, aired, resolved constructively and<br/>defused before they result in serious damage. Therefore, the parties agree that the<br/>following steps shall be followed to provide the best opportunity for a collaborative and<br/>democratic work place.</p>
<p>Step One: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involved in a dispute shall attempt to work out the dispute</p>
<p>together In face-to- face meetings.</p>
<p>Step two: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dispute is not resolved, members may request a meditative process</p>
<p>that includes trained mediators as determined by SJTA and District. The meditative<br/>process is provided for both teacher-to-teacher disputes as well as teacher-to-<br/>administrator. All correspondence and conversation during the meditative process is<br/>confidential and shall not and cannot be used in any subsequent formal process<br/>involving evaluation or discipline.</p>
<p>step three: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievance process as outlined in the contract remain in force.</p>
<p>Additionally, SJTA and the District agree to utilize an expedited arbitration process in<br/>cases involving administrative transfer for just cause as outlined in Section 4.03.8 of the<br/>collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>All provisions of the collective bargaining agreement remain in force unless otherwise stipulated in this<br/>y^~\ ft &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorandum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding.</p>

<p>between</p>
<p>The San Juan Unified School District</p>
<p>And The San Juan Teachers Association</p>
<p>May 30, 2012</p>
<p>The San Juan Unified School District (District) and the San Juan Teachers Association (SJTA) have met<br/>and negotiated to resolve the work year for the teachers assigned to Ralph Richardson School. There<br/>has been a long practice of assigning teachers beyond their regular 185 year to an extended year of 223<br/>days paid at the per deim salary rate of the assigned teachers. In 2010-2011 in order to reduce the<br/>general fund support for special education programs, the District reduced the instructional year for<br/>students assigned to Ralph Richardson. Therefore, the District and SJTA agree to the following phased-<br/>in reduction in pay rates and work year for the current teachers assigned to Ralph Richardson.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the extended year for 2012<sup>1</sup>, the current teachers will be assigned a work year of 211<sup>2</sup> days, 185<br/>regular session days and 26 additional extended year days, at their hourly per diem wage rate fora total<br/>of 6 hours.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the extended year for 2013, the current teachers will be assigned a work year of 204 days, 185<br/>regular session days and 19 additional extended year days at their hourly per diem wage rate for a total<br/>of 6 hours.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the extended year for 2014, the current teachers will be assigned a work year of 204 days, 185<br/>regular session days and 19 additional extended year days at their hourly per diem rate for a total of 4<br/>hours.</p>
<p>All subsequent years will mean 185 regular session days at their regular per diem rates and 19 additional<br/>extended days at the hourly summer session rate. In the event that there are retirements or<br/>resignations from the program during the period of phased in salary and work year reductions, the</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the extended year starts immediately after the completion of the regular year but may not be completed<br/>prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year, the reference to &quot;2012&quot; is not only for days worked during the 2011-<br/>12 fiscal year but also for those overlapping into the next fiscal year.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All work year numbers are subject to a later agreement with SJTA that would reduce work years for all teachers.</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>Exhibit BB</p>
<p>replacement teachers at Ralph Richardson will work the 185 day calendar at regular pay rates and if<br/>assigned the 19 additional extended year days at the hourly summer session rates. The parties agree to<br/>continue the practice of assigning the current teachers of the students whose programs continue into<br/>the extended year for the term of this agreement. However, such assignments for replacement teachers<br/>will be discretionary with the District in future years.</p>
<p>Because of the potential discrepancy between the student instructional year and the work year for<br/>current teachers, the teachers may be assigned to a variety of professional work assignments including<br/>but not limited to home instruction, intervention classes (including academic and social-emotional<br/>supports), teaching the extended summer Autism 5DC program, and other duties as assigned if no such<br/>teaching opportunities are available.</p>
<p>Ralph Richardson also has assigned a permit teacher whose contractual work year is 223 days at the<br/>appropriate salary schedule rate. Effective in 2011-12, the work year shall be reduced to 185 regular<br/>session days and 26 extended year days, a total of 211 for six hours at the per diem daily rate with a<br/>right of refusal for the associated extended work year. The work day will be aligned with the other<br/>teachers in this program beginning in the 2012-13 school year. In 2012-13, 204 days with first right of<br/>refusal for the associated extended work year. Upon the retirement of this teacher, the work year will<br/>revert to 185 day schedule with the extended year days assigned at the discretion of the District at pay<br/>rates in line with other extended year compensation patterns.</p>
<p>Preparation time for these teachers shall remain at the 150 minutes per week in the extended year<br/>program through the 2012-13 school year. Beginning with the 2013-14 extended year four hour<br/>program, prep time shall be provided in accordance with all other summer programs.</p>
<p>Members in this program shall continue to utilize their regular sick leave bank through the 2012-13<br/>extended year program. Beginning in the 2013-14 extended year program, sick leave utilization shall be<br/>in accordance with all other summer programs as stated in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>Members in this program shall work with their site administrator through the 2012-13 extended year<br/>program in regards to their calendar days / hours as it differs from the typical extended year program.<br/>Beginning in the 2013-14 extended year program, days / hours shall be in accordance with all other<br/>summer programs as stated in the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A network of full-day Kindergarten teachers will be established for the purpose of sharing<br/>knowledge and building upon the ideas of the different programs.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criteria for determining the establishment of full-day kindergarten shall include, but not limited<br/>to, available classrooms, transportation, facility modification, and additional student<br/>supervision.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-day kindergarten teachers shall receive prep as any other elementary teacher.</p>

<p>SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT<br/>BETWEEN THE<br/>SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT<br/>AND</p>
<p>SAN JUAN TEACHERS ASSOCIATION<br/>Online Learning Educational Options Prototype</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Each year in San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) many students drop out from our traditional high<br/>schools or graduate without meeting the minimum requirements for California state university system<br/>admission. Most exit, or lack admission requirements, because they are credit deficient or lack the<br/>acceptable GPA. Currently the San Juan Unified School District provides very limited opportunities for<br/>students to recapture credits or improve their GPA prior to their graduation and/or college application.</p>
<p>Intent:</p>
<p>The intent of this prototype is to target students who would otherwise be disenfranchised at a<br/>comprehensive high school and provide alternative services for re-engagement at the comprehensive site.<br/>The prototype will have two levels of support:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit recovery at the comprehensive sites (in 2013-14 SJUSD processed more than 2,800<br/>applications for credit recovery or missing courses; most times the classes were held outside of the<br/>students’ high school campus)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create an additional system of support for students at their high school for academic growth and<br/>success</p>
<p>More specifically the intent of this prototype is to target students who:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have failed semester or full year classes to recapture credits</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a need to retake a SJUSD ‘a-g’ course for grade improvement</p>
<p>This prototype is not intended to replace initial classroom-based instruction and students will need to<br/>apply for this prototype, as participation is voluntary. School staff will identify the students who could<br/>benefit from this program and students will be accepted based on space and the following priority list:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current 12<sup>th</sup> grade student who needs additional 10 or less credits to graduate in addition to full<br/>student load</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current 12<sup>th</sup> grade student who needs 10 or less credits for grade improvement to qualify for ‘a-g’<br/>requirements</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current 12<sup>th</sup> grade student who is credit deficient and not on track to graduate, who needs 11 or<br/>more credits to graduate in addition to full student load</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current 11* grade student who is credit deficient and not on track to graduate and/or who has<br/>failed a core class</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current 11* grade student who needs 10 or less credits for grade improvement to qualify for ‘a-g’<br/>requirements</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incoming 10<sup>th</sup> grade student who is credit deficient and not on track to graduate and/or who has<br/>failed a core class</p>
<p>Agreement</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers assigned shall be compensated with a stipend that is the pro-rata equivalent of 15% of<br/>their regular SJTA salary schedule, by semester.</p>
<p>a. Criteria used to determine compensation included, but was not limited to, the recognition that<br/>Online Learning Educational Options Prototype teachers will be issuing grades and credits to<br/>students.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers shall have the autonomy to schedule their Online Learning class over three (3), four (4) or<br/>five (5) days per week with 240 minutes of total weekly instruction.</p>
<p>a. Deviation from this schedule options may occur with the consent of the principal.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online Learning classes can begin on August 25, 2014.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers selected shall be provided release time or paid at their daily rate of pay for all mandatory<br/>trainings, professional development and meetings related to this prototype.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Site licenses will be limited to a maximum of 35 concurrent users per site.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The class size maximum is 32 students. Teachers may waive in writing this section. However,<br/>adding additional students is conditional upon the District’s ability to provide a commensurate<br/>number of computers and site licenses.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prototype will be used to explore how new technologies may be introduced into existing<br/>structures.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree to meet in November 2014 to discuss what was learned which resulted from the<br/>prototype and discuss possible next steps.</p>

<p>Memorandum of Understanding<br/>Between the<br/>San Juan Unified School District<br/>And</p>
<p>The San Juan Teachers Association<br/>System of Professional Growth Prototype</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding is to implement the next phase of<br/>the work outlined in the collective bargaining agreement (Exhibit N-l) regarding the<br/>Joint Committee's Work on Teacher Evaluation. Specifically, the statement of intent in<br/>Exhibit N-l specifies the following vision for such work:</p>
<p>It is the deeply held belief of both SJTA and SJUSD that educators are<br/>professionals that continue to grow and improve in their craft throughout their<br/>career. All levels of experience and effectiveness deserve an environment in<br/>which to further their skills. The current model of evaluations does little to<br/>support this belief.</p>
<p>Interests</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the interest of both SJUSD and SJTA to create a systematic, non-<br/>adversarial process that supports all teachers in their ongoing professional growth. This<br/>new prototype could change the structure of what we now refer to as &quot;evaluation.&quot; This<br/>new prototype sees the teacher as a key participant, and will be practitioner-driven.</p>
<p>The focus of this work is to benefit the whole, through collaboration, shared practice,<br/>and the deprivatization of the profession.</p>
<p>Provisions of the MOU</p>
<p>Therefore the parties hereby agree to the following provisions regarding the<br/>development of the prototype, hereafter identified as the &quot;System of Professional<br/>Growth Prototype&quot; (SPGP), during the 2014-2015 school year. The purpose of<br/>prototyping is to give form to an idea to learn about strengths and weaknesses of the<br/>prototypes and to identify new directions for the next phase of developing a pilot.</p>
<p>1) The Joint Committee on Teacher Evaluation shall be identified as the Professional<br/>Growth Team and shall oversee the SPGP and the implementation of the prototype<br/>described in Attachment A. The President of SJTA and the Superintendent's designee<br/>shall chair this team. The work of this team shall include: coordination with the</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>researchers Julie Koppich and Daniel Humphrey (who will document the strengths and<br/>weaknesses of our professional growth prototype), budget oversight, establishing the<br/>selection process of teachers and administrators who wish to volunteer during this<br/>prototype, designing and establishing the calibration training, selecting the participants,<br/>addressing issues that may arise during the prototype year, and providing scheduled<br/>updates to the District and SJTA at least twice during the 2014-2015 school year.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for 2014-2015 year of prototyping shall be no more than $150,000.00</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professional Growth Team shall follow the established criteria for individual<br/>participation (see Attachment B).</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who volunteer to serve as participants or observers in the prototyping<br/>process shall be held harmless. Our goal is to test the prototype, not the person, so<br/>outcomes that are a result of the prototype will be used to inform the process only.</p>
<p>5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the additional work required in trainings, focus groups, and increased<br/>workload, teachers selected as program participants shall be paid a stipend as follows:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Participants&quot; (teachers who volunteer to be observed; not to exceed 60):<br/>$1,000.00 per participant (up to a maximum of $60,000.00 for all participants)</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Peer Observers&quot; (teachers who volunteer to be an observer; not to exceed<br/>25): $1,500.00 per participant (up to a maximum of $37,500.00)</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Observers shall be provided release time, to be determined by the<br/>Professional Growth Team; the intent is to minimize the number of release days. A<br/>maximum of 150 release days for all participants will be funded for the 2014-2015<br/>school year (up to a maximum of $16,000.00 for all participants)</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consulting Teachers (who volunteer to create and deliver training, not to<br/>exceed eight in number); $1,500.00 per participant (up to a maximum of $12,000.00 for<br/>all participants)</p>
<p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application and selection process shall be completed no later than June 5, 2014.</p>
<p>7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current evaluation system shall be suspended for all SJTA members for the 2014-<br/>2015 school year except for those required to be evaluated under Education Code and<br/>the following:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members participating in the Peer Assistant Review Program per §3.08 and</p>
<p>3.09</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members designated to alternative year evaluation in 2014-15 per §3.04.10</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members with 10 or more years of employment who are notified no later than<br/>June 30 by Human Resources for evaluation</p>
<p>SJTA 14-16</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>All evaluations in 2014-15 shall adhere to Article 3.</p>
<p>8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of this agreement shall begin May 12, 2014, and shall sunset June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement shall not exclude any of the existing provisions, except as noted<br/>above, of the collective bargaining contract, which shall remain in full force during the<br/>term of this agreement.</p>

<p>SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT</p>
<p>SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (District)</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>SAN JUAN TEACHERS ASSOCIATION (Association)</p>
<p>Regarding the Early Childhood Education 2014-2015 Salary Schedule Migration</p>
<p>Background;</p>
<p>The District and SJTA are committed to working together to ensure strong ECE programs and<br/>services for children and families, wherein all teachers and staff are effectively supported and<br/>appropriately compensated to provide this high level of service.</p>
<p>On May of 2012, the District and SJTA agreed upon a seven (7) year ECE Salary<br/>Schedule migration towards a consolidated salary schedule. At the time, both parties<br/>recognized that because of the uncertainty of funding, the scale, and the extended<br/>timeline, the salary schedule migration might require adjustments. Therefore, the parties<br/>agreed to convene the Budget Review Committee (BRC) annually to determine the<br/>feasibility of percentages and make recommendations for the full range of options.</p>
<p>In recent years, the lack of state and federal funding for early childhood education has had an<br/>impact on the ECE Department's ability to remain fiscally solvent. Recent shifts in state funding<br/>include a 5% standard reimbursement rate increase for State Preschool. While this is helpful, it<br/>positively affects less than 15% of our overall ECE budget.</p>
<p>Intent:</p>
<p>The intent of this Side Letter of Agreement between the District and the Association is to modify<br/>the ECE Salary Schedule migration for the 2014-2015 school year.</p>
<p>Agreement:</p>
