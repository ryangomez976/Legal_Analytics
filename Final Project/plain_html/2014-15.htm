By agreeing to move<br/>the .5 staff development day from after the last student attendance day to prior to<br/>the first student attendance day, the District's intent is to provide additional time<br/>for individual teacher classroom preparation prior to the start of the instructional<br/>school year except as determined by the District. The salary schedule for 2013/2014</p>
<p>07-13</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>is attached hereto. Prior to July 1 of each school year, the District shall adopt an<br/>annual calendar reflecting the appropriate work days. The District reserves the<br/>right to alter the calendar in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7<sup>th</sup> - 12<sup>th</sup> grade unit members assigned to the traditional classrooms<br/>shall have one regular class period for preparation, planning, conferences and shall<br/>teach no more than 6 out of 7 periods.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every unit member shall be entitled to one duty-free uninterrupted<br/>lunch period each day. The lunch period shall be equivalent to the student lunch<br/>period, exclusive of passing periods, or line duty, but no less than thirty minutes. A<br/>relief period shall be provided to unit members equivalent to the regularly<br/>scheduled relief period for students (excepting teachers serving yard duty as per<br/>Paragraph 3).</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7th - 12th grade classroom teachers who are assigned to a single<br/>department area shall have no more than four separate subject preparations. This<br/>shall not apply to self-contained classrooms or Alternative Education assignments.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7th - 12th grade classroom teachers who are assigned to more than<br/>one department area shall have no more than three separate subject preparations.<br/>This shall not apply to self-contained classrooms or Alternative Education<br/>assignments.</p>
<p>07-13</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A subject preparation is a specific curriculum taught within a pre-<br/>established time block, See the site schedule of courses or the applicable Student<br/>Information System for a list of courses by department.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each 7th - 12th grade teacher shall have no more than thirty teaching<br/>periods per week. In addition, unit members may serve as substitute teachers<br/>during their regularly scheduled preparation, planning period. If an out-of-district<br/>substitute is not available and no unit member volunteers his/her service, the<br/>District may assign substitute duties to unit members and administrators on an<br/>equitable rotational basis. A unit member serving as a substitute teacher shall be<br/>compensated at the substitute pay rate as set forth in paragraph 12.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members assigned to grades 7 through 12 who serve as<br/>substitutes, shall be compensated at the daily long-term substitute rate, or, at the<br/>teacher's election, may request compensatory release time on an equal time basis.</p>
<p>A unit member may accumulate and maintain a maximum of five (5) days of<br/>compensatory release time. Effective July 1, 2013, whenever all students in a class<br/>at K-6 schools are assigned to other unit members because their regular teacher is<br/>absent for the full day and no substitute is available, the unit members instructing<br/>these students shall each be compensated or request compensatory release time<br/>based on the number of students they are assigned and in the following manner:</p>
<p>1-5 students 25% of an instructional day or 25% of long-term substitute pay<br/>6-10 students 50% of an instructional day or 50% of long-term substitute pay<br/>Entire Class 100% of an instructional day or 100% of long-term substitute pay</p>
<p>07-13</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>Teachers in grades K-6 who choose compensatory time in lieu of compensation as<br/>set forth herein shall comply with the requirement of Section 13 below in utilizing<br/>such compensatory time.</p>
<p>13. Compensatory release time may be used at the employee's discretion,<br/>subject to the following regulations:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District must receive five (5) working days advance written<br/>notification of intent to use release time.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who wish to carry accrued compensatory release time<br/>over to the school year succeeding the school year in which it was earned, must file<br/>the proper form with their immediate supervisor no later than the third Monday in<br/>June. Any compensatory release time thus carried over must be used during the<br/>school year succeeding the school year in which it was earned or it will be forfeited.<br/>Any compensatory release time thus carried over may not be compensated for by<br/>pay. Any compensatory release time not requested to be carried over by the third<br/>Monday in June will be paid for at the above rate.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accrued compensatory release time must be used in increments of<br/>half or full days, unless another unit member is available to substitute during the<br/>unit member's absence. Half days shall be defined as any combination of periods<br/>restricted to pre-lunch only or post-lunch only, Full days shall be defined as any<br/>combination of periods that transcends the lunch period.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the granting of the accrued compensatory release time for a<br/>specific day and days would in the judgment of the Superintendent/ designee pose</p>
<p>07-13</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>a hardship on the District or cause unacceptable circumstances to arise in regard to<br/>the member's prime job related responsibilities being successfully met, the request<br/>for leave may be denied.</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the need for less than a half time position exists at the<br/>middle school or the high school, the District may fill the position on a period-by¬<br/>period equitable basis utilizing a unit member, after consultation with the Unit, at a<br/>rate equal to the individual unit member's rate of pay for an equal period of<br/>instructional time.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who travel from one school to another on a regular<br/>basis shall have the same rights to a planning/conference period, lunch period, and<br/>physical relief breaks as do other unit members.</p>
<p>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members who serve as teachers during summer school, Saturday<br/>school or other like additional instructional days, or who engage in planning,<br/>curriculum development or collaboration as approved by the site principal during<br/>summer, winter or spring break periods, shall be compensated at $35.00 per hour.<br/>Credentialed site teachers have priority over walk-on teachers. Teachers who<br/>participate in training scheduled by the District on days beyond the 182 day work<br/>year shall be paid $150 for a full day, e.g. for 7.75 hours. In the event that the<br/>training does not continue for a full 7.75 hours, teachers shall be paid a prorated<br/>portion of the $150 per day.</p>
<p>17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parties agree that on the Wednesday prior to Thanksgiving of<br/>each year, teachers may leave the worksite fifteen (15) minutes after the scheduled<br/>student dismissal time.</p>

The parties acknowledge that as a condition of receiving the additional funding<br/>grant for K-3 Grade Span Adjustment under the Local Control Funding Formula<br/>(LCFF), the District is required to make progress toward maintaining an average<br/>class size of not more than 24 pupils for each school site in Kindergarten and<br/>grades 1 to 3 upon full implementation of the LCFF, as such progress is defined<br/>in Education Code section 42238.02. The parties intend for the District to be in<br/>compliance with this law as interpreted by subsequent guidelines and<br/>regulations of the California Department of Education (CDE) upon full<br/>implementation of the LCFF (currently 2020) as set forth in Education Code<br/>section 42238.02(d)(3)(D).</p>
<p>Effective for 2013-2014 and continuing for all subsequent school years until full<br/>implementation of the LCFF, the parties agree to an &quot;alternative annual average<br/>class size enrollment for each school site&quot; within the meaning of Education<br/>Code section 42238.02(d)(3)(B). Under this alternative, the District shall make<br/>annual progress at each school site toward the 24:1 goal by full implementation<br/>of the LCFF, but that the amount of progress at each school site shall be flexible<br/>and shall not be tied to the formula set forth in Education Code section<br/>42238.02(d)(3)(B)(i)-(v).</p>
<p>In the event the District receives information that compliance with this<br/>contractual provision may result in penalties that would reduce or eliminate the</p>

<p>CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEE EVALUATION/CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS<br/>The District and KUTA recognize that a system of periodic evaluation is essential to<br/>assist certificated employees in developing competency and realizing their potential.<br/>The parties also recognize that information gathered through such an evaluation<br/>system will help the Board of Education when making decisions regarding a<br/>certificated employee's continued employment.</p>
<p>GENERAL PROIVSIONS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of each new school year, the District will conduct an<br/>orientation meeting with all new certificated employees to explain District<br/>procedures for teacher evaluation, record keeping, classroom discipline, evaluation<br/>of students, requisition of supplies and other information which the District deems<br/>pertinent and which may be a basis for an evaluation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluator shall be a site or program administrator and other<br/>administrators selected by the evaluator to assist and/or conduct classroom<br/>observations and evaluations. The written observations and evaluation required<br/>pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 5 below shall be prepared on the KUSD Certificated<br/>Lesson Observation form attached to this Agreement as Appendix 4 (a) and the<br/>evaluation required pursuant to paragraph 6 and 7 below shall be prepared on the<br/>KUSD Annual Certificated Evaluation form attached to this Agreement as Appendix<br/>4(b).</p>

<p>22</p>
<p>employees to discuss the teaching standards being evaluated during the observation.<br/>Prior to the initial observation, the evaluator shall review the documents and<br/>procedures for the evaluation process with the certificated employee. Post¬<br/>observation conferences shall be scheduled as quickly as possible, but in no event,<br/>later than ten (10) school days following the observation.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an unsatisfactory observation(s), the evaluator shall take positive<br/>action to assist the certificated employee in correcting any cited deficiencies. The<br/>evaluator's role to assist the certificated employee should include, but is not limited<br/>to, the following:</p>

<p>ARTICLE 28</p>
<p>1UST CAUSE, DUE PROCESS AND PROGRESSIVE<br/>DISCIPLINE - BARGAINING UNIT MEMBERS</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>a. This Article is to establish just cause, due process and<br/>progressive discipline for disciplinary action affecting bargaining unit<br/>members. These procedures shall be related only to actions performed during<br/>the time unit members are engaged in carrying out job related activities.</p>
<p>These provisions govern discipline short of dismissal for all bargaining unit<br/>members and supersede California Education Code Section 44932 to the extent<br/>that provision would otherwise be deemed applicable.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Provisions</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representation: Upon request, bargaining unit members have<br/>the right to secure and utilize Association representation for any disciplinary<br/>consideration.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right of Rebuttal: Bargaining unit members shall have the right<br/>to rebut any written warning or reprimand by submitting a written statement<br/>of their position. Such written rebuttal shall be attached to the warning or<br/>reprimand.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledgment of Receipt of Documents: The bargaining unit<br/>member shall acknowledge receipt of all documents intended for placement in<br/>his/her personnel file in a manner set forth in Article 13 of this Agreement.</p>
<p>07-05</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>Notice may also be documented by utilizing registered mail to transmit true<br/>copies of documents to be filed, return receipt requested.</p>
<p>d. The substance of employee evaluations for competency is not<br/>grievable. Commentary alleging a disciplinable offense as defined in this<br/>Agreement if included in such evaluation, is grievable.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grounds</p>
<p>Grounds for &quot;progressive discipline&quot; under this Article shall consist of<br/>the dismissal categories derived from the California Education Code Section<br/>44932.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levels of Progressive Discipline: Administration of Disciplinary Action<br/>Shall Conform to the Following Progression:</p>
<p>a. Informal Level:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bargaining unit member and the appropriate<br/>administrator(s) shall meet to discuss the disciplinary issues in<br/>an effort to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Warning: If informal discussions do not resolve<br/>the matter prior to implementation of formal discipline, bargaining unit<br/>members will be provided with written warning of concerned charges and/or<br/>allegations, along with pertinent circumstances/facts giving rise to such<br/>concerns, charges, and/or allegations. Such written warnings will be<br/>transmitted to the bargaining unit member within 15 working days after the<br/>circumstances/facts were known, or should have been known.</p>
<p>07-05</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receipt of a written warning as described<br/>immediately above, the bargaining unit member shall have ten<br/>(10) working days to obtain clarification and present a response,<br/>if so desired.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor shall then have ten (10) working<br/>days to consider the matter and transmit a written decision to<br/>the bargaining unit member communicating his/her findings on<br/>the issues in the dispute, a disposition with reasons why formal<br/>discipline should be levied and a copy of disciplinary<br/>documents.</p>
<p>b. Formal Level:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Reprimand: Written reprimand for placement<br/>into the bargaining unit member's personnel file constitutes the first<br/>level of formal discipline. The District must append to the reprimand<br/>any prior written warnings and/or reprimands which are to be relied<br/>upon for any purpose.</p>
<p>(a) Reprimand (with or without suspension) will not<br/>be placed in a bargaining unit member's personnel file until<br/>exhaustion of Level III of the Grievance Procedure, unless the<br/>bargaining unit member has not caused grievance review.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension Without Pay: The second written reprimand<br/>for placement into a bargaining unit member's personnel file, including<br/>suspensions without pay (first suspension not to exceed five (5)</p>
<p>07-05</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>working days with a maximum of twenty (20) days per year), shall<br/>constitute the second level of formal discipline. The District must<br/>append to the reprimand any prior written warnings and/or<br/>reprimands which are to be relied upon for any purpose. All decisions<br/>to invoke suspensions without pay shall be made by the<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While progressive discipline levels may not be bypassed<br/>arbitrarily or capriciously, it is mutually recognized that certain conditions<br/>warrant full or partial bypass of such levels.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District retains its right to suspend with pay in<br/>accordance with the California Education Code. In the event the<br/>District subsequently seeks to invoke formal discipline under grounds<br/>covered by this Article, such action will be governed under the<br/>provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross Misconduct which in the District's judgment<br/>warrants implementation of dismissal proceedings in accordance with<br/>the California Education Code.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious misconduct of such critical nature that justifies<br/>bypassing earlier levels of progressive discipline.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual Discipline: The District and Association agree to<br/>conform to the following disciplines in order to provide for fair, thorough and<br/>objective joint considerations in any proceeding:</p>
<p>07-05</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full disclosure of known facts, circumstances and<br/>evidence pertinent to any issue under consideration.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diligent, joint effort to effect appropriate confidentiality,<br/>proper interpersonal behavior and objective communication during<br/>initial consideration and subsequent review of any disciplinary issue.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members on District approved unpaid leaves of absence shall<br/>have the option to continue to receive health insurance coverage for the period of<br/>leaves at the unit member's expense.
