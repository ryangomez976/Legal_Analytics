<p>Agreement Between Orinda Union School District</p>
<p>And the Orinda Education Association</p>
<p>Page 3</p>
<p>Ratified: January 2015<br/>Effective: July 1, 2013^June 30, 2014</p>
<p>that the Association or representatives can only make a claim on its<br/>own behalf.</p>
<p>3. A &quot;party in interest&quot; is any person who might be required to take action<br/>or against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.</p>
<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible<br/>administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems which may<br/>from time to time arise affecting the working conditions of teachers.</p>
<p>Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and<br/>confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing contained herein will be construed as limiting the right of any<br/>teacher having a grievance to discuss the matter informally with any<br/>appropriate member of the administration, and to have the grievance<br/>adjusted without intervention by the Association, provided that the<br/>adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and<br/>that the Association has been given an opportunity to be present at<br/>such adjustment and to state its views.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as<br/>possible, the time limits specified at each level should be considered<br/>to be maximums and every effort should be made to expedite the<br/>process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual<br/>agreement.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed<br/>through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school<br/>year, and if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school<br/>year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth<br/>herein will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to<br/>the end of the school year or as soon as is practicable thereafter.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level One:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aggrieved person shall first put the grievance in</p>
<p>writing and discuss it with the appropriate principal or immediate<br/>superior, either directly or through the Association's designated<br/>Grievance Representative with the objective of resolving the matter<br/>informally. The decision shall be in writing.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Two:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the disposition</p>
<p>of the grievance at Level One, or if no written decision has been rendered<br/>within ten (10) days after presentation of the grievance, he/she may file<br/>the grievance in writing simultaneously with the president of the</p>
<p>Agreement Between Orinda Union School District</p>
<p>And the Orinda Education Association</p>
<p>Page 4</p>
<p>Ratified: January 2015<br/>Effective: July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014</p>
<p>Association and the Superintendent within ten (10) days after the written<br/>decision at Level One, or after ten (10) days have elapsed from the date<br/>of presentation of the grievance at Level One, whichever is applicable.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) days after receipt of the written grievance by the<br/>Superintendent, the Superintendent or his/her designee will meet with the<br/>aggrieved person and a representative of the Association in an effort to<br/>resolve it. The decision of the Superintendent or his/her designee shall<br/>be in writing.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Three:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the</p>
<p>disposition of his/her grievance at Level Two, or if no written decision<br/>has been rendered within ten (10) days after he/she has first met with the<br/>Superintendent or his/her designee, he/she may, within ten (10) days<br/>after a decision by the Superintendent or his/her designee, or after ten<br/>(10) days have elapsed from the date he/she first met with the<br/>Superintendent, whichever is applicable, request in writing to the<br/>Superintendent for conciliation of the grievance. Upon receipt of timely<br/>request to the Superintendent, the parties shall agree to the appointment<br/>of a facilitator to assist the parties in resolving the grievance. If a<br/>mutually agreeable facilitator is not found within ten (10) days, the<br/>Superintendent will request the services of the California Conciliation<br/>Service. The facilitator shall not make public recommendations relative<br/>to the grievance. The facilitator shall attempt to resolve the grievance<br/>within twenty (20) days of his/her appointment. If resolution cannot be<br/>reached within twenty (20) days, the grievant may submit to the<br/>Association a request to pursue binding arbitration. The Association<br/>may submit the request within fifteen (15) days of completion of level<br/>three to the Superintendent</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wthin thirty (30) days of the request to the Superintendent,<br/>representatives of the District and the Association shall attempt to agree<br/>upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator and obtain a commitment from said<br/>arbitrator to serve. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator<br/>within the specified period, the Association shall request a list of<br/>arbitrators with State Mediation and Conciliation Services. The selection<br/>of the arbitrator and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under<br/>the voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration<br/>Association.</p>
<p>The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and a court reporter shall be<br/>shared equally. Any additional expenses shall be borne by the party<br/>incurring expenses.</p>
<p>The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall set forth his/her<br/>findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted,</p>

<p>And the Orinda Education Association</p>
<p>Page 5</p>
<p>Ratified: January 2015<br/>Effective: July 1,2013^June 30, 2014</p>
<p>unless the parties have agreed to use the expedited arbitration<br/>procedures of the AAA.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, delete, or alter any<br/>provisions of this agreement but shall limit his/her decisions to the<br/>application and interpretation of its provision.</p>
<p>The decisions of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties<br/>to this agreement.</p>
<p>5. A grievance which affects an individual teacher, more than one teacher<br/>in a building, or teachers in more than one building, may be initiated by<br/>any directly affected teacher in the district at Level Two.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rights of Teachers to Representation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Superintendent or by any<br/>member or representative of the administration or the Board against any<br/>aggrieved person, any party in interest, any member of the Association, or<br/>any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such<br/>participation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by<br/>him/herself, his/her attorney, or, at his/her option, by a representative<br/>selected by the Association. If a teacher is not represented by the<br/>Association or its representative, the Association shall have the right to be<br/>present and to state its views at all stages of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>E. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miscellaneous</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a grievance arises from action or inaction on the part of a member of<br/>the administration at a level above the principal or immediate superior,<br/>the aggrieved person shall submit such grievance in writing to the<br/>Superintendent and the Association directly and the processing of such<br/>grievance shall commence at Level Two.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The association may process such a grievance through all levels of the<br/>grievance procedure even though the individual aggrieved person does<br/>not wish to do so where such grievance reasonably may have district¬<br/>wide consequences or application.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No grievance shall be filed more than sixty (60) days after the event<br/>giving rise to it has occurred.</p>

<p>Page 6</p>
<p>Ratified: January 2015<br/>Effective- July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions rendered at levels one and two of the grievance procedure will<br/>be in writing setting forth the decision and the reasons therefor and will<br/>be transmitted promptly to all parties in interest and to the president of<br/>the Association. Time limits for appeal provided in each level shall begin<br/>the day following receipt of written decision by the parties in interest.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the<br/>Association to attend a grievance meeting or hearing during the<br/>day, he/she will, upon written notice to his/her principal or<br/>immediate superior by the president of the Association, be<br/>released without loss of pay in order to permit participation in the<br/>foregoing activities.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is necessary for a representative designated by the<br/>Association to investigate a grievance, he/she will, upon written<br/>approval of the Superintendent, be released for a mutually<br/>agreed upon amount of time, without loss of pay in order to<br/>permit participation in the investigation.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, taking appeals, making<br/>reports and recommendation, and other necessary documents will be<br/>prepared jointly by the Superintendent and the Association.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All grievance procedures shall be conducted in good faith in a manner<br/>fair to all parties and at mutually agreeable times.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal rules of evidence shall not apply.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All documents and written communications dealing with the<br/>processing of a grievance shall be kept in the personnel file (s) of<br/>the participant (s).</p>
<p>ARTICLE VIII: Professional Dues and Payroll Deductions</p>
<p>A. Any teacher who is a member of the Association, or who has applied for<br/>membership, may sign and deliver to the Board an assignment authorizing<br/>deduction of the unified membership dues to the Association. Such<br/>authorization shall continue in effect from year to year unless revoked in writing<br/>between June 1 and September 14 of any year. Pursuant to such<br/>authorization, the Board shall deduct one-tenth of such dues from the regular<br/>salary check of the teacher each month for ten months. Deductions for<br/>teachers who sign such authorization after the commencement of the school<br/>year shall be appropriately prorated to complete payments by the end of the<br/>school year.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to all sums deducted by the Board pursuant to authorization of the<br/>employee, the Board agrees promptly to remit such monies to the Association<br/>accompanied by a list of teachers (which shall be submitted by the Association)<br/>indicating for whom such deductions have been made.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association agrees to furnish any information needed by the Board to fulfill</p>
<p>the provisions of this article.</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon appropriate written authorization from the teacher, the Board shall deduct</p>
<p>from his/her salary and make appropriate remittance for annuities, credit union,<br/>savings bonds, charitable donations, or any other voluntary plans or programs<br/>jointly approved by the Association and the Board. The district shall be held<br/>harmless for any suit, claim, demand made upon it as a result of these voluntary<br/>deductions not being deducted properly.</p>
<p>ARTICLE DC: Orientation</p>

<p>K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assignment Status</p>
<p>The assignment status of teachers teaching less than full time shall be pro¬<br/>rated on the basis of a full time schedule.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-5 teachers normally work a percentage of a normal 5 day week<br/>(e.g., a 3 daywork schedule is a 60% assignment) or portions of<br/>days.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workday agreements are based on &quot;regular&quot; school days. On days with<br/>&quot;special schedules,&quot; the part-time teacher workday may be shorter or<br/>longer depending on the schedule for the day. Examples of days when the<br/>part-time teacher may have a shorter workday are common planning days,<br/>minimum days, and early release days. Examples of days when the part-<br/>time teacher may have a longer workday are days with assembly<br/>schedules, testing days, and parent conference days.</p>

Release time will only be granted upon successfully securing<br/>substitute teachers to cover classes. This release time will not be<br/>duplicated for any site with multiple enrichment specialists providing<br/>the same instruction. Every effort shall be made to prioritize substitutes<br/>covering for the specific activities listed below. In the event there is a<br/>substitute shortage, the district will be held harmless, and this section<br/>with all stipulations contained within, will be exempt from the grievance<br/>process. Release time for specialists shall be reduced or eliminated as<br/>a result of a reduction or elimination of funding for the actual program<br/>events stated below. The specific authorized activities are:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary PE Specialists shall receive up to three (3) full days<br/>(or six (6) half (1/2) days) per site, between February and May of<br/>each year, for required state physical fitness testing of fifth grade<br/>students.</p>

<p>employees to a schedule with consecutive teaching periods. However, it<br/>may be necessary to include no more than one lunch or preparation period<br/>between teaching periods as part of the assignment. Normally this will<br/>apply to assignments of three periods or more. Student brunch is not<br/>counted in a part-time schedule.</p>

Substitute differential pay is defined as pay<br/>equivalent to the difference between the teacher's salary and the cost of<br/>hiring a substitute. The rate of differential pay shall remain the same<br/>throughout the one hundred (100) days. The cost of hiring a substitute<br/>will be deducted from the teacher's salary whether or not a substitute is<br/>actually hired. This substitute differential pay shall expire after one<br/>hundred (100) days.

Tenured employees shall remain on<br/>the rehire list up to thirty-nine (39) months. Probationary employees<br/>shall remain on the rehire list up to twenty-four (24) months. Nothing in<br/>this section shall prevent a teacher from applying for leave under &quot;-<br/>Other Leaves of Absence&quot; in this Article.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may require a confirmation of the medical necessity of any<br/>absence due to illness or injury and may require an anticipated date of<br/>return. This confirmation need not specify the diagnosis or prognosis,<br/>except as required by law, e.g., for Tuberculosis under the Education<br/>Code. <sup>5</sup></p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principals shall not recruit teachers from other schools within the district.</p>
<p>A principal may speak to a teacher from another school about an opening<br/>only if the teacher contacts him/her. If so contacted, the principal shall<br/>encourage the teacher to speak to his/her principal and shall notify the<br/>Superintendent that such a contact has been made.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers will not be transferred arbitrarily, nor without a rational basis in<br/>fact, nor as a disciplinary measure.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An administration initiated transfer shall occur only after a meeting<br/>between the teacher and the administration. The teacher shall have the<br/>right to representation at the meeting, and to be notified of the reasons for<br/>the transfer. A good-faith effort to find alternative solutions to the problem<br/>will be made by the administration if the teacher objects to the proposed<br/>transfer.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduled conference or written notice by the Superintendent or<br/>designee regarding administrative initiated transfers shall be made to<br/>teachers before the staffing list is issued. If a teacher is to be<br/>transferred in the summer or after the beginning of the school year,<br/>he/she shall be notified as soon as it becomes evident that such a<br/>transfer is required. Transferred teachers will be notified of their<br/>assignment no later than the last day of school or when staffing list is<br/>distributed.</p>

<p>ARTICLE XIV: Evaluation for Certificated Employees</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The primary goal of evaluation is to help teachers develop autonomous growth,<br/>promote trust, and become more effective in their professional role through<br/>constructive written and oral feedback. Evaluation shall be based on the OUSD<br/>Teacher Job Description(s) and the OUSD Certificated Employee Standards. These<br/>standards are based on the California Standards for the Teaching Profession and<br/>include an additional standard relating to professional conduct.</p>
<p>Timelines for establishing the evaluation option</p>
<p>By the second week of school, each site principal will conduct an informational<br/>meeting for all teachers scheduled to be evaluated. The purpose of the meeting will<br/>be to review the procedures for the two options for certificated staff evaluation.</p>
<p>Probationary and temporary employees shall be formally observed and evaluated<br/>according to the timelines as outlined on Exhibit E.</p>
<p>By October 25, the administrator will have met individually with each certificated staff<br/>being evaluated to establish a focus question and an action plan to address them.<br/>(Plan 2).</p>
<p>Frequency</p>
<p>Teachers who are new to the district will be formally observed by their immediate<br/>supervisor at least three (3) times during the year; other probationary teachers at<br/>least twice during the year; and tenured teachers every three years except under the<br/>following circumstances:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who request an annual evaluation</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who did not meet or exceed all district standards on their<br/>prior evaluation</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who did not make sufficient progress on their goals in the<br/>prior evaluation.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers identified by the principal who have been notified in the prior<br/>year's evaluation conference and provided reasons for an annual<br/>evaluation.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are new to the district, but have been tenured in another<br/>district and for whom the principal decides by January 15 need only one<br/>formal observation.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tenured teachers will be evaluated every three (3) years.</p>
<p>Agreement Between Orinda Union School District</p>
<p>And the Orinda Education Association</p>
<p>Page 35</p>
<p>Ratified: January 2015<br/>Effective: July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014</p>
<p>This does not preclude additional evaluations by the Superintendent.</p>
<p>Options</p>
<p>Plan 1 - Intensive evaluation</p>
<p>An intensive evaluation is provided to all teachers who are temporary, probationary or<br/>who are tenured and having serious difficulties in meeting one or more of the district's<br/>standards. An intensive evaluation is based upon specific elements of the California<br/>Standards for the Teaching Profession, evaluates professional conduct and the<br/>performance of non-instructional duties. It involves a specified minimum number of<br/>formal observations by the administrator (see Exhibit E) and informal observations<br/>with written feedback to the teacher. Informal observations include, but are not<br/>limited to unscheduled observations, conversations with the principal and the teacher,<br/>observations of participation in staff and committee meetings and non-teaching<br/>duties.</p>
<p>Prior to each formal observation, the evaluator and the teacher will confer regarding<br/>the lesson objectives and strategies and the relationship to the California Standards<br/>for the Teaching Profession, as reflected on the observation checklist. Following the<br/>observation, the administrator will complete an observation form and will conference<br/>with the teacher regarding the observation. The teacher will receive written feedback<br/>within five days of the observation. A final form will contain a summative evaluation<br/>that is based upon formal and informal observational information that has been<br/>gathered and shared with the teacher throughout the school year (see Exhibit E).</p>
<p>Copies of all observation forms will be attached to the summative evaluation.</p>
<p>Procedures for Tenured Teachers Needing Improvement</p>
<p>One purpose of evaluation is to provide intensive support for teachers who have not met<br/>District Standards. The following procedures for evaluation are designed to provide a<br/>framework within which both the teacher and the principal may move with confidence.</p>
<p>a. Teachers who are not performing up to district standards as revealed in the<br/>prior evaluation shall participate in an intensive evaluation with a minimum of<br/>two observations including pre and post conferences and one written<br/>evaluation. A plan of corrective action related to the California Standards for<br/>the Teaching Profession and/or OUSD professional conduct will be developed<br/>by the administrator with input from the teacher. District resources will be<br/>identified and made available in the nature of visitations, assistance by other<br/>teachers, etc.</p>
<p>To help eliminate possible misunderstandings and to provide a reference, the<br/>written plan for corrective action is to be signed by the participant. The<br/>signature is to indicate that the plan has been discussed but does not<br/>necessarily mean agreement.</p>

<p>Page 36</p>
<p>Ratified: January 2015<br/>Effective- July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If as a result of the January 15 review, it is determined that problems still exist,<br/>the teacher, principal and Superintendent will meet prior to February 15. At this<br/>time the serious nature of the situation will be outlined in writing and discussed.<br/>Ways in which the teacher has failed to comply with the plan of corrective action<br/>will be clearly stated in the written report.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the February 15 conference, the principal will invite other<br/>principals or district personnel to observe and review records of the teacher<br/>during February and early March. At least two other persons will complete a<br/>classroom evaluation of the teacher during this period. If it is determined by the<br/>District that the problem is serious enough to call for dismissal action, the<br/>teacher will be so notified in writing by March 15.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated above, the purpose of wide involvement is to develop a clear-cut<br/>position to be supported by the principal, his/her colleagues and district office<br/>personnel. This serves as a safeguard for the teacher and offers definite<br/>support for the administrator in his/her position.</p>
<p>Plan 2 - Reflective Evaluation</p>
<p>A reflective evaluation provided upon agreement between the teacher and the<br/>administrator, to tenured teachers whose previous evaluation met or exceeded district<br/>criteria. In Plan 2, the teacher selects a focus question, which is intended to be<br/>reflective. The foundation of the process is in the establishment of the focus question.<br/>The focus question should be guided by inquiry about teaching practices, which are<br/>connected, to California Standards for the Teaching Profession. Teachers<br/>participating in the plan continue to be responsible for meeting the District Standards<br/>of Performance, however, the emphasis of the evaluation will be on the focus question<br/>(see Exhibit E).</p>
<p>Teachers are encouraged to develop an evaluation alternative that will best address<br/>the focus question. The following are examples of the type of alternatives that<br/>teachers could incorporate in their plans:</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher generated options - Teachers are encouraged to develop<br/>new or innovative options for use as evaluative tools or may select<br/>option as described in Plan 1.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collaborative groups - Participants will meet for regular, structured,<br/>interactions between peer groups of inter/intra disciplinary or grade<br/>levels. The groups may focus on a particular educational growth area or<br/>curricular program. The groups will meet at scheduled times not only to<br/>discuss each teacher's focus question, but to discuss commonalities in<br/>instruction or service.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portfolios - Portfolios will serve as a compilation of materials selected by<br/>the teacher to create a &quot;photo album&quot; of progress made in addressing</p>

<p>And the Orinda Education Association</p>
<p>Page 37</p>
<p>Ratified: January 2015<br/>Effective: July 1, 2013-June 30, 2014</p>
<p>the focus question. Sample items may include a log of activities, student<br/>work, and examples of assignments or curriculum, photographs,<br/>videotapes, or student evaluations of activities.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer coaching - A peer coach will be mutually selected by the teacher<br/>and administrator. The purpose of the peer coach is to provide clarity<br/>through reflective feedback on progress in addressing the teacher's<br/>focus question. This will be accomplished through four to six<br/>meetings, which may include pre-conferencing, observations,<br/>modeling, and discussion.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of the peer coach must be agreed upon by the coach and<br/>the administrator.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action research - The teacher will select and outline a specific concept,<br/>instructional strategy, or learning theory to be researched and<br/>implemented. This will entail documentation of the in-depth study,<br/>practices implemented, and a determination of the validity of the concept<br/>researched. This may be completed in conjunction with graduate course<br/>work or mentor projects.</p>
<p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendance and implementation of staff development strategies - The<br/>teacher may select a specific strategy presented through professional<br/>staff development programs or conferences. Focus will be on the<br/>implementation and evaluation of the impact of this strategy. A self-<br/>reflective journey may be used as an evaluation criteria tool.</p>
<p>By March 1, the teacher and administrator will meet to discuss progress toward<br/>addressing the focus question. If either party believes that the teacher will not be able<br/>to satisfactorily address the focus question by May 15, the administrator will complete<br/>a formal observation as described in Plan 1 - Intensive evaluation, above by May 15.<br/>That teacher will also participate in an Intensive evaluation during the following<br/>school year. Under unusual circumstances teachers may request that their<br/>evaluations be continued into the following year.</p>
<p>Procedures Regarding Evaluation</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation shall be based on the OUSD Teacher Job Description and the<br/>District Performance Standards.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Education teachers will be evaluated by their site administrator<br/>with the assistance and support of the Director of Special Services.</p>

<p>In California, and also under this Agreement, a domestic partnership shall be established when all of the<br/>following requirements are met:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both partners have a common residence. The term &quot;common residence&quot; means that both<br/>domestic partners share the same residence. It is not necessary that the legal right to possess<br/>the common residence be in both of their names. Two people have a common residence even if<br/>one or both have additional residences. Domestic partners do not cease to have a common<br/>residence if one leaves the common residence but intends to return.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons agree to be jointly responsible for each other's basic living expenses incurred<br/>during the domestic partnership. The term &quot;basic living expenses&quot; means shelter, utilities and<br/>other costs directly related to the maintenance of the common household of the common<br/>residence of the domestic partners. It also means any other cost, such as medical care, if some<br/>or all of the cost is paid as a benefit because a person is another person's domestic partner. The<br/>term &quot;joint responsibility&quot; means that each partner agrees to provide for the other partner's basic<br/>living expenses if the partner is unable to provide for himself or herself.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither person is married or a member of another domestic partnership.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two persons are related by blood in any way that would prevent them from being married to<br/>each other in California.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons are at least eighteen years of age</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both persons are members of the same sex.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One or both of the persons meet the eligibility criteria under Title II of the Federal<br/>Social Security Act as defined in 42 U.S.C. Section 402(a) of old-age insurance<br/>benefits, or Title XVI of the Federal Social Security Act as defined in 42 U .S.C.<br/>Section 1381 for aged individuals.</p>
