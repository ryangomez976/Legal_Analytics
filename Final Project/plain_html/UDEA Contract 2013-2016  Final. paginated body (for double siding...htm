<p>7.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective solution is found when differences which may lead to a grievance<br/>are resolved in an amicable, informal way between the parties involved at the lowest<br/>possible administrative level.</p>
<p>7.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before filing a formal written grievance, the aggrieved shall attempt to resolve it by<br/>an informal conference with the immediate supervisor within twenty (20) days after<br/>the aggrieved knew, or reasonably should have known, of the event or condition<br/>which gives rise to the grievance.</p>
<p>7.3 Principal or Immediate Supervisor Level</p>
<p>7.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grievance is not resolved at the informal conference the aggrieved shall have<br/>ten (10) days from the date of the conference to file a formal grievance, in writing,<br/>on the appropriate form to his/her immediate supervisor.

Beginning with the Association, each<br/>party shall alternately strike a name until only one name remains. The remaining<br/>name shall be the arbitrator. In the event that the arbitrator is unable to serve, the<br/>parties shall request an arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association.</p>
<p>7.5.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator so selected will hear the matter promptly and will issue the decision<br/>not later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the close of the hearing, or, if<br/>oral hearings have been waived, then from the date the final statements and proofs<br/>are submitted to him/her. The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and will set<br/>forth his/her findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issue(s) submitted.<br/>The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon the District, the Association,<br/>and the unit member(s) involved, unless the arbitrator exceeds his/her authority, the<br/>decision evidences an infidelity to the Agreement, or he/she acts in contravention of<br/>the facts and/or law. Copies shall be sent to both the Association and to the District<br/>Superintendent.</p>
<p>7.5.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the arbitrator stems from this Agreement, and his/her function is to<br/>interpret and apply this Agreement and to pass upon alleged violations thereof. The<br/>arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any of the terms of<br/>this Agreement or any appendix attached thereto, nor render any decision which<br/>requires the commission of an act prohibited by law or which is in violation of the<br/>terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.5.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall construe this Agreement in a manner which does not interfere<br/>with the District's rights as described in Article 4, except where they have been<br/>expressly and clearly limited by the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p>7.5.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator must resolve issues of arbitrability before hearing the substantive<br/>matters.

<p>7.5.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the District to follow advisory recommendations of any<br/>advisory committee.</p>
<p>7.5.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the District to grant any request or benefit described by the<br/>Agreement as permissive.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Provisions</p>
<p>7.6.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the same complaint or substantially the same complaint is made by more than one<br/>unit member against one respondent, a group or class action may be initiated. Such<br/>grievance shall indicate what other employees are included in the class action. In a<br/>class action grievance, only one (1) representative of the class, may process the<br/>grievance. At the arbitration level, however, more than one grievant may be<br/>released for purposes of serving as a witness provided that the testimony is not<br/>cumulative. Class action grievants who are not witnesses shall not be compensated<br/>to attend the arbitration.</p>
<p>7.6.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the purpose of this grievance procedure to provide redress of grievance under<br/>the current Agreement and it is not the purpose of this grievance procedure to<br/>provide for changes in the Agreement. Such changes must be undertaken in the<br/>negotiation process.</p>
<p>7.6.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only disputes regarding employer/employee relations matters covered by the<br/>specific terms of this Agreement shall be subject to this grievance procedure.</p>
<p>7.6.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time limits provided in this policy may be extended or reduced by the mutual<br/>written agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>7.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the time limits are extended or shortened by mutual written agreement<br/>among all parties to the grievance, any decision not appealed within the time limits<br/>from one level to the next in the grievance policy shall be considered settled on the<br/>basis of the last decision not subject to further appeal. If a decision is not given to<br/>the aggrieved within the required time limit, an appeal may be taken to the next<br/>level.</p>
<p>7.6.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the pendency of any proceeding and until a final determination has been<br/>reached, all proceedings shall be considered as confidential as possible, and any<br/>preliminary disposition will not be made public without the agreement of all parties.</p>
<p>7.6.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the District or the Association against any<br/>participants in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.</p>
<p>7.6.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member may present grievances in accordance with this Article without the<br/>intervention of the Association so long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the<br/>terms of this Agreement. The District shall not agree to the final resolution of the<br/>grievance until the Association has received a copy of the grievance and the<br/>proposed solution and has been given an opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>7.6.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meetings shall be held at a time and place which will afford an opportunity for all<br/>persons, entitled to be present, to attend. Participation in such meetings shall be<br/>without loss of pay. Every effort will be made to avoid disrupting classroom<br/>instruction.</p>
<p>7.6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filing of a grievance shall in no way interfere with the right of the District to<br/>proceed in carrying out its management responsibilities, subject to final decision of<br/>the grievance. In the event the alleged grievance involved an order, requirement,<br/>etc., the aggrieved shall fulfill or carry out such order or requirement, etc., pending<br/>the final decision of the grievance, except if such order, requirement, etc., should<br/>pose an imminent danger to the safety or health of the unit member.</p>
<p>7.6.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grievance may be withdrawn at any level without establishing precedent.</p>
<p>7.6.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the failure of the District to consult shall be subject to this grievance procedure,<br/>whenever the obligation to consult is so stated. It is further understood that, unless<br/>specifically stated, there is no implied obligation for the District to reach agreement<br/>as a result of any &quot;consultation&quot;, and, therefore, the outcome of such consultation is<br/>not subject to the grievance process.</p>
<p>7.6.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any record(s) pertaining to a grievance shall be kept in a file separate from the<br/>aggrieved's official District personnel file.</p>
<p>ARTICLE 8</p>
<p>HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>8.1 Work Year</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year shall consist of one hundred eighty-seven (187) days for all unit<br/>members during their first year of employment and one hundred eighty-five (185)<br/>for all other unit members covered by the terms of this contract except for<br/>counselors, whose work year shall be one hundred ninety-two (192) days, with the<br/>option of five additional days; and psychologists whose work year shall be one<br/>hundred ninety-seven (197) days, and nurses whose work year will be one hundred<br/>eight-five (185) days, with the option of the District requiring an additional ten (10)<br/>days at the per diem rate. The two days required for bargaining unit members<br/>during their first year of employment shall be compensated at the normal substitute<br/>rate.</p>
<p>8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two staff development days, as defined in Education Code Section 44579-44579.4,<br/>are part of the work calendar. The pay for these days is reflected in the current<br/>salary schedule. If the State funding for these days is eliminated or reduced below<br/>the current level, the work year and the salary schedule will be reduced<br/>proportionately. Because the District receives funding for these work days only<br/>upon verification of individual teacher attendance, the District may require an<br/>acceptable verification for any sick leave, and personal necessity leave may not be<br/>utilized for these days.</p>
<p>8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last student day shall be a modified day ending after 240 minutes of student<br/>attendance. This would also be the last teacher workday. The afternoon work time<br/>would be the time for final cleanup and year-end &quot;check-out&quot; procedures.</p>
<p>8.2 Hours of Duty</p>
<p>8.2.1 While it is recognized that the professional work day extends beyond the time spent<br/>at school, the normal on-site work day shall be 6 1/2 hours exclusive of lunch. Unit<br/>members shall be available at their respective work sites for professional<br/>preparation, including consultations with parents, students, and co-workers, for an<br/>average of 45 minutes each day outside of student class time. The distribution of<br/>the 45 minutes before and after class time shall be decided, with staff input at each<br/>site, subject to the principal's approval and consistent with 8.2.8.</p>
<p>8.2.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the professional work day, unit members are responsible<br/>for implementing classroom instructional programs, supervising and<br/>providing for the safety of students, counseling and reporting to<br/>parents and students on student progress, participating in activities<br/>designated to improve professional competency, and participating on<br/>school committees designed to review, change, improve, or design<br/>educational programs.</p>

<p>8.2.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;District-wide Staff Development Collaboration Day Program</p>
<p>UDEA and the District believe that teacher collaboration is a key component of<br/>effective schools. Teacher collaboration time provides opportunities for staff to<br/>share best practices, coordinate curriculum efforts, and plan activities and staff<br/>development designed for improved student achievement.</p>
<p>8.2.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;schools will operate on a late-start Wednesday program.</p>
<p>8.2.7.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle School teachers will use the time for<br/>Team/Department meetings or preparation for Back-to-<br/>School Night and Open House.</p>
<p>8.2.7.2 Elementary schools will operate on an early-release Wednesday program.</p>
<p>8.2.7.2.1 Collaboration days will be planned each month according to<br/>a 1 - 3 - 1 model as follows:</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday - Planned by principal</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> Wednesdays - Planned collaboratively<br/>by unit members</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup> Wednesday (if it occurs in a given month) - Planned<br/>individually by unit members</p>
<p>On the 1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday of each month, unit members may be<br/>required to travel to another site up to three (3) times per<br/>school year. On days where unit members are required to<br/>travel, the 1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday meeting shall begin at 1:45 p.m.<br/>and not exceed sixty minutes. After the meeting unit<br/>members will be released for travel, collaboration, and/or<br/>preparation.</p>
<p>Should the principal not utilize their 1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday of each<br/>month, it shall be planned collaboratively by unit members.</p>
<p>8.27.2.2 Staff meetings or required professional development<br/>meetings shall not occur during the weeks when Open House<br/>and Back-to-School Night occur.</p>
<p>8.2.7.2.3 In January of 2011, elementary schools shall have the option<br/>to discontinue the Staff Development Collaboration Day Program<br/>starting with the subsequent school year. A valid vote consists of at least<br/>90% of all elementary unit members. Of that vote, a simple 50% plus<br/>one (1) of those voting shall make the decision. If the District<br/>discontinues its Staff Development Collaboration Day Program, it will<br/>revert to a non-modified day bell schedule.</p>
<p>8.2.7.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under extenuating circumstances, upon request the building</p>
<p>principal may authorize the scheduling of individualized<br/>education program team (IEP) and student study team<br/>(SST) meetings during collaboration time.</p>
<p>8.2.7.2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindergarten and transitional kindergarten teachers will<br/>participate in one unit members planned collaboration day<br/>each month.</p>
<p>8.2.7.2.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collaboration day summary shall be completed as part<br/>of each certificated collaboration day and submitted to the<br/>principal at the end of the day.</p>
<p>8.2.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorization to leave the school during the working day for other than job-related<br/>duties shall be obtained from the building principal or designee.</p>
<p>8.2.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless there are extenuating circumstances, required faculty meetings shall not:</p>
<p>8.2.9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceed one (1) hour beyond the normal workday.</p>
<p>8.2.9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be scheduled on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, or days prior to<br/>school holidays after the normal workday or be held the Tuesday<br/>prior to the first Wednesday of the month.</p>
<p>8.2.9.4</p>
<p>Be scheduled, whenever possible, without twenty-four (24) hours<br/>advanced notice.</p>
<p>8.2.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unit participants in an I.E.P. meeting shall be consulted regarding scheduling of</p>
<p>such meetings prior to the schedule being set.</p>
<p>8.2.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itinerant support personnel shall not be given yard duty assignments.</p>
<p>8.2.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Staffing</p>
<p>8.2.12.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared staffing means the sharing of a single assignment by a unit<br/>member and another credentialed member. Normally the assignment<br/>is shared on a 50/50 basis. Other configurations may be approved,<br/>however, with the mutual consent of the Superintendent, or his/her<br/>designee, and the unit members involved. Absent an unforeseeable,<br/>major life-altering event, the deadline for applying for shared staffing<br/>for the following year shall be April 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
<p>8.2.12.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptance of unit members for a shared-staffing assignment shall<br/>be at the discretion of the Superintendent, or his/her designee, and<br/>approved by the Board. Shared staffing assignments shall be limited<br/>to one shared staffing assignment per elementary schools site.<br/>Shared staffing assignments shall be limited to two consecutive<br/>school years. In the event that there are no shared staffing<br/>assignment applications at a school site, unit members who have<br/>participated in a shared staffing assignment for two consecutive<br/>school years may apply for an additional year in a shared staffing<br/>assignment.</p>
<p>8.2.12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unit member shall assume his/her share of the regularly<br/>required duties and responsibilities. Both may be required, at the<br/>discretion of their principal, to jointly conference with parents during<br/>required parent/teacher conference periods; to attend &quot;Back-to-<br/>School-Night&quot; and/or inservice meetings. Unit members participating<br/>in shared staffing shall teach the number of days proportional to their<br/>percentage of the share. For example, a .50 FTE teacher would teach<br/>90 of the 180 student days. Additionally, Unit members participating<br/>in shared staffing shall attend all staff development days for the<br/>percentage of each staff development day that reflects their<br/>proportionate share of a 1.0 FTE assignment. For example, a .50<br/>FTE shared staffing teacher shall attend 50% of each of the staff<br/>development days. The site administrator with input from the unit<br/>member shall determine the staff development day schedule for each<br/>shared staff assignment unit member. The site administrator shall<br/>notify the unit member of the staff development day schedule at least<br/>five school days in advance of the staff development day. If the site<br/>administrator does not provide notice regarding the staff<br/>development day schedule, the unit member shall attend their<br/>proportionate share of the day.</p>
<p>8.2.12.4</p>
<p>Collaboration Days</p>
<p>Each unit member shall be required to attend Collaboration meetings.<br/>The number of Collaboration meetings a unit member is required to<br/>attend shall be determined based upon which of the two models<br/>below that is utilized for the shared-staffing assignment:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared-staffing agreement may be approved where unit<br/>members work the number of Collaboration Days that equates to<br/>their FTE percentage. In addition to the meetings that are part of the<br/>approved shared-staffing calendar, each unit member may be<br/>required to attend up to three (3) Collaboration meetings per school<br/>year beyond their FTE percentage. Generally, the principal shall<br/>give notice of these required meetings 3-4 weeks in advance. For<br/>attendance at these additionally required meetings, unit members will<br/>receive either: (a) the Supplemental Pay Rate; or (b) will be excused<br/>from attending a mutually agreed to future Collaboration meeting.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared staffing agreement may be approved where one unit<br/>member is scheduled to work on all Collaboration Days, and the<br/>second unit member is not scheduled to work on any Collaboration<br/>Day. The unit member not scheduled on Collaboration Days shall be<br/>required to attend the number of Collaboration Day meetings that<br/>equates to his/her FTE percentage. No additional compensation will<br/>be provided for attendance at these meetings. Unit members who do<br/>not norm ally work on Collaboration Days cannot be required to<br/>attend any additional meetings beyond their FTE percentage.</p>
<p>8.2.12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shared-staffing assignment does not affect a unit member's rights<br/>granted under the current Employment Agreement.</p>
<p>8.2.12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote the success of the shared-staffing program, the<br/>District and UDEA agree to collaborate on activities designed to<br/>educate all parties concerned regarding the program. These activities<br/>may include, but are not limited to, an annual jointly sponsored<br/>informational meeting designed to describe the criteria, expectations,<br/>contractual requirements, etc. of the program, as well as to describe<br/>the elements of successful partnership models and allow participants<br/>to network.</p>

<p>14.5.4.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the opinions of the unit member's physician and the<br/>District-selected physician conflict, then the unit member and the<br/>Board shall mutually agree upon examination by an impartial third<br/>physician whose medical opinion shall be conclusive and binding on<br/>the issue of medical capacity in the performance of normal duties. If<br/>the unit member and the Board cannot agree upon the impartial third<br/>physician, such appointment shall be made by the County Medical<br/>Society.

<p>A leave of absence shall be granted to any certificated unit member who has applied for<br/>disability allowance, not to exceed thirty (30) days beyond final determination of the<br/>disability allowance by the State Teachers' Retirement System.

<p>14.15.7 Compensation/Benefits During Leave</p>
<p>14.15.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the six (6) days of paid family illness leave (14.3), family and<br/>medical leave is an unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>14.15.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will maintain its usual contribution toward the employee’s<br/>health benefit during your leave on the same terms as if the employee had<br/>continued to work. During this period of time, the employee will be<br/>required to pay to the District the employee’s usual contributions to health<br/>benefits. Employees taking Bonding Leave, Family Care Leave, Serious<br/>Health Condition Leave, and Military Emergency Leave will generally be<br/>provided with group health benefits for a 12 workweek period.<br/>Employees taking Military Caregiver Leave may be eligible to receive<br/>group health benefits coverage for up to a maximum of 26 workweeks. If<br/>the period of family and medical care leave ends at or after the midpoint of<br/>that particular month, and the employee remains on unpaid leave, the<br/>District paid contribution toward health benefits will continue through the<br/>end of the month. If the family and medical care leave ends before the<br/>midpoint of that particular month, and the employee remains on unpaid<br/>leave, the employee is responsible for paying the pro-rata share of the<br/>District’s contribution for that month. In some instances, the District may<br/>recover premiums it paid to maintain health coverage if the employee does<br/>not return to work following family and medical leave.</p>
<p>An employee who takes a pregnancy disability leave (either under the California Pregnancy<br/>Disability Leave or a pregnancy disability pursuant to Education Code section 44965) shall have<br/>the pregnancy disability leave run concurrently with an employee’s family and medical leave<br/>under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The pregnancy disability leave, however, shall<br/>not run concurrently with an employee’s right to utilize the family and medical leave under the<br/>California Family Rights Act (CFRA) for the purpose of caring for and/or bonding with a<br/>newborn baby. Accordingly, an employee may take a pregnancy disability leave for a period of<br/>time to be determined by the employee’s physician, and take an additional twelve (12) weeks of<br/>family care leave under CFRA for the purpose of caring for and/or bonding with the newborn<br/>baby. Contributions for the employee’s health benefits during the additional twelve (12) weeks<br/>shall be covered pursuant to Subsection 14.15.7.2.</p>
<p>14.15.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may deny a request for family and medical care leave under the provisions<br/>of the FMLA/CFRA.</p>
<p>14.15.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shared Staffing Employees</p>
<p>In order for an employee working under a Shared Staffing Agreement to be eligible to receive<br/>family and medical leave benefits, the unit member must: (1) have worked for the District for a<br/>total of 12 months; and (2) have worked at least 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months, been<br/>in a shared staffing agreement (that equates to a 1.0 FTE) over the last 12 months, or, for<br/>instructional employees, have been employed as a 1.0 FTE over the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>For employees working under a Shared Staffing Agreement, they, if eligible, may receive a<br/>combined total of 12-weeks of FMLA/CFRA leave in a twelve-month period. Eligible<br/>employees may receive a pro-rata share, based upon their FTE percentage, of the 12 weeks of<br/>FMLA/CFRA leave. For instance, if an employee is eligible for the leave and is in a Shared<br/>Staffing Agreement where the employee is a 0.5 FTE, the employee may receive 6 weeks of<br/>FMLA/CFRA leave.</p>
<p>The District will maintain its usual contribution toward the employee’s health benefits for the<br/>employee’s prorated period of the twelve workweeks of family and medical care leave. During<br/>this period of time, the employee will be required to pay to the District the employee’s usual<br/>contributions to health benefits.</p>
<p>Except for the pro-rated share of paid family illness leave (14.3), family and medical leave is an<br/>unpaid leave of absence.</p>
<p>Eligible employees are subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in Article 14.15.1<br/>through 14.15.9 and, to the extent applicable, those requirements and conditions will be pro-rated<br/>based upon the employee’s FTE percentage.</p>
<p>14.16 Military Spousal Leave</p>
<p>14.16.1 The District provides spouses and registered domestic partners of certain<br/>military personnel up to ten (10) days of unpaid leave during a qualified<br/>leave period.

<p>14.16.2</p>
<p>An employee is eligible for leave under this policy if he or she:</p>
<p>14.16.2.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the spouse or registered domestic partner of a person who: (1) is<br/>a member of the Armed Forces of the United States who has been<br/>deployed during a period of military conflict to an area designated<br/>as a combat theater or combat zone by the President of the United<br/>States; or (2) is a member of the National Guard or of the Reserves<br/>who has been deployed during a period of military conflict;</p>
<p>14.16.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works for the District for an average of 20 or more hours per<br/>week;</p>
<p>14.16.2.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provides the District with notice of his or her intention to take<br/>leave within two business days of receiving notice that his or her<br/>spouse or registered domestic partner will be on leave from<br/>deployment; and</p>
<p>14.16.2.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submits written documentation to the District certifying that the<br/>spouse or registered domestic partner will be on leave from<br/>deployment during the time the leave is requested.</p>
<p>14.16.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military conflict means either a period of war declared by the United States<br/>Congress, or a period of deployment for which a member of a reserve component<br/>is ordered to active duty either by the Governor or the President of the United<br/>States.</p>
<p>14.16.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave taken under this policy will not affect an employee’s right to any other<br/>benefits.</p>
<p>14.16.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District will not discriminate against, or tolerate discrimination against, any<br/>employee who requests and/or takes leave under this policy.</p>

<p>15.6.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option of part-time employment shall not be exercised without the written<br/>request of the unit member. The unit member shall submit such request no less<br/>than three (3) months prior to the end of the semester preceding the year in which<br/>work reduction is to occur.</p>

<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests by teachers, with full-time positions right, to return to a full-time<br/>assignment, timely filed, shall be granted. For purposes of assignment, such<br/>teachers shall have the same status as other teachers returning from leave.</p>
<p>Exceptions may be made; assuming their current school will have an equal or<br/>greater number of positions in the following year.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person in a shared position may remain at his/her assigned school if the<br/>partner is a “temporary,” plans to share with someone else on the staff, or<br/>finds a partner at another school.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should both partners wish to return to full time, the partner with the<br/>greatest seniority at that school shall have the option to remain. Should<br/>both have equal school seniority, the involuntary transfer criteria found in<br/>the transfer section of this Agreement shall be used.</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests to continue in a shared position may be granted at the discretion of the<br/>Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages, fringe benefits, leaves, and other benefits shall be prorated at the percentage that<br/>the shared-staffing teacher’s assignment relates to a full-time assignment.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher on a shared-staffing assignment who performs substitute duties during an<br/>unassigned work time shall be paid for that service according to the current substitute<br/>teacher salary schedule.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers on shared-staffing retain a 100% employment relationship (with the exception<br/>of those on Optional Pre-Retirement). An appropriate designation is made of the 100%<br/>to active and unpaid leave (e g. 50% active, 50% unpaid).</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective September 1, 1983, all shared-staffing personnel must complete a minimum of<br/>one hundred thirty-five (135) days in paid status in order to qualify for a year’s service<br/>credit for the purpose of movement on the salary schedule. This means it will take all<br/>such personnel a minimum of two (2) years to qualify for one (1) year’s service credit.</p>
