<p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2013-14 there will be no changes to the Extended Day Pay Schedule. (Appendix B)</p>
<p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 2013-14 only, certificated employees with a 2013-14 salary schedule placement in<br/>column B, column C, years 1 to 15 in column D, years 1 to 15 in column E, and any<br/>certificated employee without a California preliminary or clear credential shall receive a one¬<br/>time (off schedule) payment of $750.00 per FTE (prorated based on FTE).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one-time payment will be paid as a lump sum payment on June 30, 2014.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one-time payment will be made only to bargaining unit members in the above<br/>salary schedule placements who were in the employment of the district on June 1,<br/>2014.</p>
<p>Daily Rate of Pay</p>
<p>D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily rate of pay is calculated by dividing an employee's base pay on the salary schedule by</p>
<p>the number of days in the employee's work year.</p>
<p>Units Credited for Salary Advancement</p>
<p>E. Shall be credited as they are earned subject to the conditions specified below:</p>
<p>1. An official transcript of courses completed or a statement signed by the instructor or<br/>the registrar of the college or university that the course has been satisfactorily<br/>completed will be required no later than the last working day before October 1, to be<br/>applicable for salary schedule placement purposes for that school year. Failure to<br/>observe this provision shall cause the crediting of the units to be held to the next<br/>school year except in extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units are defined for the purposes of this Article and Appendix A as semester<br/>units.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfactory completion of each unit of approved college credit is required to advance<br/>from one salary class to another. Courses to be credited for advancement on the<br/>salary schedule must be approved by the appropriate District Management person<br/>prior to completion of the course. With respect to units taken for credit on the salary<br/>schedule, the units must be upper division or graduate level courses.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may request credit for a lower division course. If a site<br/>administrator makes a favorable recommendation of a lower division course,<br/>the Superintendent or designee shall review such recommendation prior to<br/>approval being granted. Approval shall be on a case-by-case basis and no<br/>approval shall set a precedent.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be approved, units must:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relate to the employee's teaching assignment;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a part of a program leading toward an advanced degree in a field<br/>related to the employee's teaching assignment or a field in which the<br/>employee is credentialed to teach within the District; or</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be a part of a program leading toward an additional education<br/>services credential.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the employee takes a course for which salary credit is not allowed pursuant to<br/>paragraph D.3.b.l of this Article, and if within two years of taking the course the<br/>employee is reassigned to teach in the area of the course taken, the District shall<br/>reevaluate the course for salary credit based upon paragraph D.3.b.l of this Article.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District may, but is not obligated to, give credit for courses taken without<br/>prior approval.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee shall have completed at least four semester units every six years<br/>to advance. The District will provide in-service programs that employees<br/>may attend in order to meet this requirement within the six-year period.</p>
<p>Initial Salary Schedule Placement</p>
<p>F. When employees are employed initially in the District, their transcripts will be evaluated to<br/>determine which graduate courses completed, in addition to those required for a bachelor's<br/>degree, will be accepted for salary schedule purposes.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement on the first step of the salary schedule is based on the completion of a<br/>bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university with no additional<br/>approved units and with no creditable years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Units and degrees will be accepted only from accredited colleges and universities.<br/>Accredited colleges and universities are defined for purposes of this Article and<br/>Appendix A as those from which units are accepted by the California Commission<br/>for Teacher Preparation and Licensing.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minimum of 75% of the teaching days of the year must be completed for<br/>one year credit.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After initial credit is given, year for year credit shall be given for additional<br/>experience in the District.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vocational education teachers whose credentials are based upon a bachelor's degree<br/>and supervised practice teaching will be placed on the salary schedule in the same<br/>manner as regular teachers.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vocational education teachers whose credentials are based upon work<br/>experience at the journeyman level, with or without a bachelor's degree and<br/>without supervised practice teaching, will be placed on the first step of the<br/>salary schedule.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work experience beyond that required by vocational education teachers for<br/>their credential, will be credited on the basis of one year's salary schedule<br/>advancement for every two years of work experience completed up to a<br/>maximum of eight years of credit on the initial salary schedule placement.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salary schedule advancement will be allowed for creditable units earned<br/>beyond the issuance of the work experience based credential.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum of twelve years of previous experience shall be granted for<br/>certificated employees entering the District for the first time in a “hard to fill”</p>
<p>position. The designation of the “hard to fill” is based on meeting both of the<br/>following criteria:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacancy has been in existence in excess of six months, whereby a<br/>diligent search resulting in no qualified, competent applicants and/or<br/>qualified competent applicants were unwilling to accept position at<br/>contract starting salary.</p>

<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in emergency circumstances, there will be no mandatory yard<br/>supervision duties. The time that teachers would have been assigned<br/>to those duties will be utilized as preparation time.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparation time shall mean a regular period of time within each teacher's<br/>workday that is set aside for all regular classroom teachers, to be utilized<br/>primarily for planning, preparation of lessons, instructional materials, and<br/>grading student papers. Additionally, the time may be utilized for rest breaks,<br/>meetings with site or District officials, student or parent conferences arranged<br/>by the employee (or by site officials in circumstances requiring immediate<br/>attention), coverage of other classes in unusual circumstances, and assigned<br/>student supervision during inclement weather. Preparation time shall not be<br/>utilized for the extension of regular school site, department, or grade level<br/>staff meetings.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the goal of the District to limit preparations at the junior high and senior<br/>high schools to three.</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Class assignments will be made by each school principal following<br/>consultation with each department or department head. When the<br/>school principal determines that a given department may allot the<br/>assigned course offerings within the department on the basis of group<br/>preference, the goal shall not apply. Should a situation occur<br/>involving preparations that exceed the goal within the department, the<br/>Association will be notified by the Administration.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should a situation occur involving preparations that exceed the goal<br/>within the department the following will occur:</p>
<p>(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association President will be notified in writing by the<br/>Administration.</p>
<p>(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected staff has the right to appeal to the Superintendent or<br/>designee as soon as possible but at least five (5) days prior to<br/>the semester start date.</p>
<p>(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes which combine different grade levels into one instructional<br/>period count for only one preparation. (For example: Spanish 4 and 5,<br/>French 3 and 4 taught in the same class period count as one<br/>preparation.)</p>
<p>(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In departments where there are several single class offerings, the<br/>principal shall attempt to limit preparations to the extent possible.</p>
<p>(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes offered during the regular instructional day and for which the<br/>employee receives extra pay pursuant to Appendix B shall not count<br/>as a preparation.</p>
<p>(6) Teachers required to substitute during their preparation period shall<br/>receive a stipend equal to the hourly rate of pay for summer school<br/>teachers. Other non-teaching certificated employees required to<br/>substitute for an absent teacher shall receive a stipend equal to the<br/>hourly rate of pay for summer school teachers.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When weekly preparation minimums are lost due to Conference Week and/or<br/>holidays, the District shall endeavor to equitably provide in a timely manner<br/>replacement preparation time.</p>
<p>(1) Conference Week - Except for circumstances, which arise from time<br/>to time, teachers, will typically be allowed recess and lunch without<br/>reduction in minutes, although the parties recognize the necessity for<br/>flexibility as to the occurrence in any particular day.</p>
<p>i. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff meetings shall be held as follows:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all schools, site staff meetings shall be held during the workday as<br/>scheduled by the Principal.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically there will be one (1) staff meeting a month. The parties<br/>recognize that exceptions will from time to time occur and that these<br/>provisions are not intended to be construed as restrictive in nature.</p>

<p>18</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work year shall conclude prior to June 30 of the school year.</p>

<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unused sick leave shall accrue from school year to school year.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide each employee with a written statement of<br/>accumulated and credited sick leave for the current school year as soon after<br/>the beginning of the school year as possible.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sick leave also may be taken for necessary medical examinations or treatments that<br/>cannot be scheduled outside of regular work hours.</p>

<p>26</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees shall request to take a personal necessity leave at least three days in<br/>advance of the day on which the personal necessity leave is intended to be taken,<br/>unless the necessity involved is of such a character as to make it impossible to make<br/>such request three days in advance, in which case the request shall be made as much<br/>in advance as possible.</p>

<p>at least three days prior to the date of the leave to the supervisor.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor shall respond within two (2) days of receipt of the request. This day<br/>may not be used for any concerted activities.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate supervisor may deny the use of any day if a substitute teacher is not<br/>available for that day. Denial shall be based upon inverse order of request.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the supervisor has approved the request for leave, the supervisor may not<br/>rescind that unless there is an unforeseen emergency.</p>

<p>one year.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All leaves must be requested, in writing, by the teacher involved. The leave may be<br/>granted when acceptable reasons for such leave are presented to and approved by the<br/>Board. No leave request shall be unreasonably denied.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of benefit to the District or hardship, at the conclusion of the initial period<br/>for which the leave was granted, such leave may be extended, upon request, for an<br/>additional period not to exceed one year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon request, unpaid child rearing leave commencing after November 30 shall be<br/>granted for the remainder of that year and up to an additional year.</p>

<p>receipt of the jury summons. Notifications of return shall be as soon as practical.</p>

<p>G. An employee shall be entitled to industrial accident or illness leave for any job-related<br/>accident or illness in the amount of up to 60 days during which the schools of the District are<br/>required to be in session or when the employee would otherwise have been performing work<br/>for the District in any one fiscal year for the same accident.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such benefits shall be in addition to other sick leave benefits provided by the District.</p>

<p>Sabbatical Leave</p>
<p>H. Sabbatical leave may be granted to provide opportunities for study and/or research when it is<br/>incidental to planned, approved research. Requests for sabbatical leaves are considered on<br/>the basis of the professional improvement of the employee, which will ultimately contribute<br/>to the benefit of the students and the District.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher must complete seven consecutive years of satisfactory service on a regular<br/>credential with the District to be eligible. Service interrupted by a leave of absence<br/>for purposes of graduate study or a special assignment of a professional nature this<br/>year shall not count toward the seven years nor shall it constitute an interruption in<br/>service. A second period of eligibility must be served before a second sabbatical<br/>leave can be granted.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for sabbatical leave shall be for a one year period only. Inclusive dates of<br/>the leave shall fall within one school year.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teachers absent on sabbatical leave at any one time shall not exceed<br/>one and one-half percent of the total number of certificated employees. The number <sup>29</sup></p>
<p>29</p>
<p>of leaves (if any) shall be determined by the Board of Trustees through budgetary<br/>authorization.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall pay to the teacher 50% of the base salary to which he would be<br/>entitled if he were actually on duty in the District. Approval of any employment<br/>during the sabbatical leave period shall be secured from the Superintendent prior to<br/>the acceptance of the employment. The District shall provide all Insurance benefits<br/>in force at the time of approval of leave.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicants must furnish a suitable bond indemnifying the District for any salary paid<br/>the teacher during the period of the sabbatical leave in the event the teacher fails to<br/>return to render two full years of service to the District following the termination of<br/>the sabbatical leave, or in the event the teacher fails satisfactorily to carry out the<br/>approved program of study. Should the death, disability or illness of the teacher<br/>prevent the fulfillment of the obligation, no penalty shall be exacted of him, his heirs,<br/>or the surety.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mutual agreement, between the District and the teacher, a teacher, incapacitated<br/>because of illness or accident just prior to or during a sabbatical leave which requires<br/>postponement or cancellation of the leave, may return to the District to complete<br/>leave requirements under a special extension.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all matters outside of this Agreement, which have specified review procedures,<br/>such procedures shall be the sole method of review or challenge.</p>

<p>1. The grievant and designated representative, if any, participating in the processing of<br/>the grievance, shall suffer no loss in pay if meetings or appointments are mutually<br/>scheduled by the District and the Exclusive Representative. <sup>50</sup></p>
<p>50</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee may, at any time, present grievances to the Employer and have such<br/>grievances adjusted without the intervention of the Exclusive Representative, as long<br/>as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided,<br/>however, that the employer shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the<br/>Exclusive Representative has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed<br/>resolution and has been given an opportunity to file a response.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all levels of the grievance procedure, the grievant shall provide the Exclusive<br/>Representative with all details and copies of correspondence relative to the grievance.</p>
<p>F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a grievance has been initiated, all matters of dispute relating to it, which occur during<br/>the processing of the grievance, shall become a part of and be resolved in the grievance<br/>proceeding.</p>
<p>1. Once a grievance has been resolved or a final decision rendered, a grievant shall not<br/>be entitled to initiate a new grievance on any matter or occurrence, which properly<br/>could have been included in the first grievance.</p>
<p>G. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limits may be extended or shortened by mutual agreement of the grievant and District.</p>
<p>1. Failure of the grievant or the grievant's representative to adhere to the time limits of<br/>this Article shall constitute waiver of the grievance and acceptance of the District's<br/>action or decision at the appropriate level.</p>
<p>H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reprisal of any kind will be taken by the District against any grievant or participant in the<br/>grievance procedure by virtue of such participation.</p>
<p>1. All written materials pertinent to a grievance, except decisions resulting from final<br/>determinations or settlements, shall be filed separately from the personnel file for the<br/>grievant or any participant.</p>
<p>I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until final disposition of the grievance takes place, the grievant shall conform to the original<br/>direction of the District.</p>

<p>J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to initiating a formal grievance under this Article, the employee shall meet informally</p>
<p>with the lowest level supervisor who has the authority to resolve the matter. Within twenty<br/>(20) workdays after the Grievant knew, or reasonably should have known, of the occurrence<br/>of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance, the Grievant shall present the grievance in<br/>writing to the immediate supervisor and meet with the supervisor to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The written grievance shall contain the following minimum information:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant’s name;</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The date of filing;</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific article(s) and section(s) alleged to be violated, misinterpreted or<br/>misapplied;</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief summary of the informal conference and the date if one was held;<br/>and,</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific relief requested.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grievances not containing the required information may be rejected as improperly<br/>filed. Such rejection shall not extend the time limits of this Article.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grievant may request a conference with the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 10 days of receipt of the grievance by the supervisor, or within 10 days of the<br/>conference, the supervisor shall communicate a decision to the grievant in writing. If<br/>the supervisor does not respond within the time limit, the grievance is denied and the<br/>grievant may appeal to the next level.</p>
<p>Level Two - Superintendent</p>
<p>K. If the grievance is denied at Level One, a written appeal to the Superintendent or designated<br/>representative shall be filed within five days of the issuance of the Level One decision or the<br/>deadline within which such decision was to be made.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal shall contain all materials utilized in the first level, including the decision<br/>rendered, if any, and a speci fic and concise statement of the reason for the appeal.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Superintendent or designated representative shall meet with the grievant and the<br/>representative, if the grievant so desires, within 10 days of the receipt of the appeal. <sup>52</sup></p>
<p>52</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 10 days of receipt of the appeal, or within 10 days of the meeting between the</p>
<p>Superintendent, a written decision and the reasons for such decision shall be<br/>transmitted to the grievant. If there is no response within the specified time limit, the<br/>grievance is denied and the grievant may proceed to the next level.</p>
<p>Level Three</p>
<p>L. If the grievance is not resolved to the satisfaction of the Grievant at Level Two, within five<br/>days of delivery to the Exclusive Representative of the Level Two response, the exclusive<br/>representative may, with written notice to the District, request the California State<br/>Conciliation and Mediation Service for the appointment of a State mediator. Upon<br/>appointment of the mediator, mediation shall be scheduled according to availability of the<br/>mediator and the parties.</p>
<p>1. Nothing herein shall be construed to deny an employee access to judicial review<br/>following exhaustion of these remedies.</p>
<p>Level Four</p>
<p>M. If the mediator is unable to assist the parties in resolving the grievance, within ten (10<sup>s</sup>)<br/>days of the final mediation meeting, the exclusive representative may request in writing<br/>that the grievance be submitted to binding arbitration. A copy of the request must be<br/>received by the District within the ten-day limitation in order to be timely.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of the Arbitrator.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If no agreement can<br/>be reached, the parties shall request a list of seven arbitrators from the State Mediation<br/>and Conciliation Service (CSMC). The parties shall each strike there from, alternately,<br/>one name and the remaining name shall be that of the arbitrator. (The party to strike the<br/>first name shall be the loser in a coin toss.)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearing shall be scheduled at a date and time designated by the<br/>arbitrator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedural objections to arbitrability of a grievance shall be resolved by<br/>the arbitrator prior to a hearing on the merits.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the arbitrability of the grievance, the arbitrator shall<br/>conduct a hearing on the merits and consider evidence and arguments<br/>pertaining to the grievance(s). <sup>53</sup></p>
<p>53</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Decision.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arbitrator shall submit a written decision, which sets forth findings of<br/>fact, reasoning and conclusions on the precise issue(s) submitted. The<br/>arbitrator’s determination shall specifically state whether the grievance is<br/>approved or denied, and if approved, the proper remedy, if any.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision shall be limited solely to the interpretation and<br/>application of the collective bargaining agreement to the precise issue(s)<br/>submitted for arbitration, and the evidence deduced at hearing. The<br/>arbitrator shall not determine any other issue(s).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arbitrator shall not add to, subtract from, modify, alter or amend any<br/>provisions or procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement.<br/>The arbitrator shall not issue statements of opinion or conclusions not<br/>essential to the determination of the issue(s) submitted.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the District has made a judgment involving the exercise of<br/>discretion, the arbitrator shall review such decision solely to determine<br/>whether the decision violated the agreement. The arbitrator shall not<br/>substitute his/her judgment as to discretionary matters for that of the<br/>District.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances shall the remedy set forth by the arbitrator include<br/>compensatory damages outside the terms of the collective bargaining<br/>agreement, monetary penalties, attorneys’ fees or costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless judicial review is requested by a party, the decision of the arbitrator<br/>shall be final and binding upon the parties pursuant to paragraph N below.</p>
<p>4. Costs.</p>
<p>The parties shall share equally the costs and fees of the arbitrator. The costs<br/>associated with presenting or defending the matter shall be borne by the respective<br/>parties._The cost of a court reporter or stenographer shall be paid by the party<br/>requesting one, unless the other party requests a transcript in which case, the cost<br/>will be shared equally.</p>
<p>N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If either party asserts that the arbitrator exceeded his/her authority under this Agreement</p>
<p>or that the award is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the party may seek<br/>review in superior court within thirty (30) days of receipt of the arbitrator ‘s decision.</p>
<p>The standard of review by the superior court shall be whether there was substantial<br/>evidence to support the arbitrator’s decision and/or whether there was an error in law.<br/>Each party shall bear its own costs for the court’s review. <sup>54</sup></p>
<p>54</p>
<p>The District and ADTA recognize that all employees are entitled to all of the rights guaranteed by<br/>State and Federal constitutions and statutes. Nothing herein shall be construed to either expand those<br/>rights or reduce them.

<p>Complaints Concerning District Employees<br/>Administrative Regulation—AR 1312.1</p>
<p>Complaints Concerning District Employees</p>
<p>Complaint Procedures</p>
<p>The Superintendent/Principal or designee shall determine whether a complaint should be considered<br/>a complaint against the district and/or the individual, and whether it should be resolved by the<br/>district's process for complaints concerning personnel, other district procedures or both.</p>
<p>(cf. 1312.2 - Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials)</p>
<p>(cf. 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures)</p>
<p>In order to promote fair and constructive communication, the following procedures shall govern the<br/>resolution of complaints against district employees:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort should be made to resolve a complaint at the earliest possible stage. Whenever<br/>possible, complaints concerning school personnel should be made directly by the complainant to the<br/>person against whom the complaint is made. Parents/guardians are encouraged to attempt to orally<br/>resolve concerns with the staff member personally.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a complainant is unable or unwilling to resolve the complaint directly with the person involved,<br/>he/she may submit an oral or written complaint to the employee's immediate supervisor or the<br/>principal.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a written complaint is received, the employee shall be notified.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All complaints related to district personnel other than administrators shall be submitted in writing<br/>to the principal or immediate supervisor. If the complainant is unable to prepare the complaint in<br/>writing, administrative staff shall help him/her to do so. Complaints related to a principal or central<br/>office administrator shall be initially filed in writing with the Superintendent or designee.<br/>Complaints related to the Superintendent shall be initially filed in writing with the Board President.<br/>Complaints related to a Board member shall be initially filed in writing with the Superintendent or<br/>Board President.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written complaint must include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of each employee involved</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summaiy of the complaint and the facts surrounding it and</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific description of any prior attempt to discuss the complaint with the employee and the<br/>failure to resolve the matter</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person responsible for investigating complaints will attempt to resolve the complaint to the<br/>satisfaction of the person(s) involved within 30 working days.</p>
<p>7. The complainant may appeal a decision by the principal or immediate supervisor to the</p>
<p>APPENDIX C<br/>Page 5 of 5</p>
<p>Superintendent/Principal or designee, who will attempt to resolve the complaint to the satisfaction of<br/>the person(s) involved within 30 working days. Complainants should consider and accept the<br/>Superintendent or designee's decision as final. However, the complainant, the employee, or the<br/>Superintendent/Principal or designee may ask to address the Board regarding the complaint.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before any Board consideration of a complaint, the Superintendent/Principal or designee shall<br/>submit to the Board a written report concerning the complaint, including but not be limited to:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of each employee involved</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief but specific summary of the complaint and the facts surrounding it, sufficient to inform<br/>the Board and the employee(s) as to the precise nature of the complaint and to allow the employee(s)<br/>to prepare a defense</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the signed original complaint</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of the action taken by the Superintendent/Principal or designee, together with his/her<br/>specific finding that the problem has not been resolved and the reasons</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may uphold the Superintendent's decision without hearing the complaint.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All parties to a complaint may be asked to attend a Board meeting in order to present all<br/>available evidence and allow every opportunity for explaining and clarifying the issue.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Board holds a closed session to hear complaints or charges brought against an<br/>employee, the employee shall receive written notice of his/her right to have the complaints or<br/>charges heard in open session rather than closed session. This notice shall be delivered personally or<br/>by mail at least 24 hours before the time of the session, and the employee may request that the<br/>complaints or charges be heard in open session. Complaints concerning Board members shall be<br/>addressed in open session unless a closed session is warranted pursuant to Education Code 35146 or<br/>48918 or Government Code 54957 or 54957.6. (Government Code 54957)</p>
<p>(cf. 9321 - Closed Session Purposes and Agendas)<br/>(cf. 9323 - Meeting Conduct)</p>
<p>12. Any decision of the Board shall be final.</p>
<p>Complaints Regarding Child Abuse</p>
<p>When a complaint of child abuse is alleged, the district shall provide parents/guardians procedures<br/>for filing a child abuse complaint with the appropriate child protective agencies. Upon request, such<br/>procedures shall be written in the primary language of the parent/guardian, and the<br/>Superintendent/Principal or designee shall provide an interpreter if needed. (Education Code 48987)</p>
<p>Providing the above procedures to parents/guardians does not relieve mandated reporters from their<br/>duty to report suspected child abuse in accordance with law.</p>

<p>The Board encourages the early, informal resolution of complaints at the site level whenever<br/>possible.</p>
<p>The Board recognizes that a neutral mediator can often suggest compromise that is agreeable to<br/>all parties in a dispute. In accordance with uniform complaint procedures, whenever all parties<br/>to a complaint agree to try resolving the problem through mediation, the Superintendent or<br/>designee shall initiate that process. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the results<br/>are consistent with state and federal laws and regulations.</p>
<p>In investigating complaints, the confidentiality of the parties involved and the integrity of the<br/>process shall be protected. As appropriate for any complaint alleging discrimination,<br/>harassment, intimidation, or bullying, the Superintendent or designee may keep the identity of a<br/>complainant confidential to the extent that the investigation of the complaint is not obstructed.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the district's uniform complaint procedures are available free of charge.</p>
<p>Procedures</p>
<p>All complaints shall be investigated and resolved within 60 days of the district's receipt of the<br/>complaint. (5 CCR 4631)</p>
<p>Compliance officers shall maintain a record of each complaint and subsequent related actions,<br/>including all information required for compliance with 5CCR 4631 and 4633.</p>
<p>All parties involved in allegations shall be notified when a complaint is filed, when a complaint<br/>meeting or hearing is scheduled and when a decision or ruling is made.</p>
<p>Step 1: Filing of Complaint</p>
<p>Any individual, public agency or organization may file a written complaint of the district's<br/>alleged noncompliance with federal or state laws or regulations governing educational programs.<br/>(5CCR 4630)</p>
<p>A complaint concerning unlawful discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying may be<br/>filed only by a person who alleges that he/she personally suffered unlawful discrimination,<br/>harassment, intimidation, or bullying or by a person who believes that an individual or any<br/>specific class of individuals has been subjected to it. The complaint shall be initiated no later<br/>than six months from the date when the alleged discrimination, harassment, intimidation or<br/>bullying occurred, or six months from the date when the complainant first obtained knowledge of<br/>the facts of the alleged discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying. However, upon<br/>written request by the complainant, the Superintendent or designee may extend the filing period<br/>for up to 90 calendar days. (5 CCR 4630)</p>
<p>A complaint alleging noncompliance with the law regarding the prohibition against requiring<br/>students to pay student fees, deposits, and charges may be filed anonymously if the complaint<br/>provides evidence or information leading to evidence to support an allegation of noncompliance.<br/>(Education Code 49013)</p>
<p>The complaint shall be presented to the compliance officer who shall maintain a log of<br/>complaints received, providing each with a code number and a date stamp.</p>
<p>If a complainant is unable to put a complaint in writing due to conditions such as illiteracy or<br/>other disabilities, district staff shall help him/her to file the complaint. (5 CCR 4600)</p>
<p>Step 2: Mediation</p>
<p>Within three days of receiving the complaint, the compliance officer may informally discuss with<br/>the complainant the possibility of using mediation. If the complainant agrees to mediation, the<br/>compliance officer shall make all arrangements for this process.</p>
<p>APPENDIX D<br/>PAGE 8 Of 10</p>
<p>Before initiating the mediation of a complaint alleging discrimination, harassment, intimidation<br/>or bullying, the compliance officer shall ensure that all parties agree to make the mediator a party<br/>to related confidential information.</p>
<p>If the mediation process does not resolve the problem within the parameters of law, the<br/>compliance officer shall proceed with his/her investigation of the complaint.</p>
<p>The use of mediation shall not extend the district's timelines for investigating and resolving the<br/>complaint unless the complainant agrees in writing to such an extension of time. (5 CCR 4631)</p>
<p>Step 3: Investigation of Complaint</p>
<p>Within 10 calendar days of receiving the complaint, the compliance officer shall provide the<br/>complainant and/or his/her representative an opportunity to present the complaint and any<br/>evidence, or information leading to evidence, to support the allegations in the complaint. The<br/>compliance officer also shall collect all documents and interview all witnesses with information<br/>pertinent to the complaint.</p>
<p>A complainant's refusal to provide the district's investigator with documents or other evidence<br/>related to the allegations in the complaint, failure or refusal to cooperate in the investigation or<br/>engagement in any other obstruction of the investigation, may result in the dismissal of the<br/>complaint because of a lack of evidence to support the allegation. (5CCR 4631)</p>
<p>In accordance with law, the district shall provide the investigator with access to records and/or<br/>other information related to the allegation in the complaint and shall not in any way obstruct the<br/>investigation. Failure or refusal of the district to cooperate in the investigation may result in a<br/>finding based on evidence collected that a violation has occurred and in the imposition of a<br/>remedy in favor of the complainant. (5 CCR 4631)</p>
<p>Step 4: Response</p>
<p>Unless extended by written agreement with the complainant, within 60 days of receiving the<br/>complaint, the compliance officer shall prepare and send to the complainant a written report of<br/>the district's investigation and decision, as described in Step #5 below. (5 CCR 4631)</p>
<p>Step 5: Final Written Decision</p>
<p>The district's decision shall be written in English and, when required by Education Code 48985,<br/>in the complainant's primary language,</p>
<p>For all complaints, the decision shall include: (5 CCR 4631)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings of fact based on the evidence gathered</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion(s) of law</p>
<p>APPENDIX D<br/>PAGE 9 Of 10</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disposition of the complaint</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationale for such disposition</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice of the complainant's right to appeal the district's decision within 15 days to the<br/>CDE and procedures to be followed for initiating such an appeal</p>
<p>In addition, any decision concerning a discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying<br/>complaint based on state law shall include a notice that the complainant must wait until 60<br/>calendar days have elapsed from the filing of an appeal with the CDE before pursuing civil law<br/>remedies. (Education Code 262.3)</p>
<p>If investigation of a complaint results in discipline to a student or an employee, the decision shall<br/>simply state that effective action was taken and that the student or employee was informed of<br/>district expectations. The report shall not give any further information as to the nature of the<br/>disciplinary action.</p>
<p>If a complaint alleging noncompliance with the laws regarding student fees, deposits, and other<br/>charges is found to have merit, the district shall provide a remedy to all affected students and<br/>parents/guardians, which, where applicable, shall include reasonable efforts to ensure full<br/>reimbursement to them. (Education Code 49013)</p>
<p>Appeals to the California Department of Education</p>
<p>If dissatisfied with the district's decision, the complainant may appeal in writing to the California<br/>Department of Education. (Education Code 49013 ;5 CCR 4632)</p>
<p>The complainant shall file his/her appeal within 15 calendar days of receiving the district's<br/>decision and the appeal shall specify the basis for the appeal of the decision and whether the<br/>facts are incorrect and/or the law has been misapplied. The appeal shall be accompanied by a<br/>copy of the locally filed complaint and a copy of the district's decision. (5CCR 4632)</p>
<p>Upon notification by the CDE that the complainant has appealed the district's decision, the<br/>Superintendent or designee shall forward the following documents to the CDE (5CCR 4633)</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the original complaint</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the decision</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of the nature and extent of the investigation conducted by the district, if not<br/>covered by the decision</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>A copy of the investigation file, including but not limited to all notes, interviews, and</p>
<p>APPENDIX D<br/>PAGE 10 Of 10</p>
<p>documents submitted by the parties and gathered by the investigator</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report of any action taken to resolve the complaint</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the district's complaint procedures</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other relevant information requested by the CDE</p>
<p>The CDE may directly intervene in the complaint without waiting for action by the district when<br/>one of the conditions listed in 5CCR 4650 exists, including when the district has not taken action<br/>within 60 days of the date the complaint was filed with the district. (5 CCR 4650)</p>
<p>Civil Law Remedies</p>
<p>A complainant may pursue available civil law remedies outside of the district's complaint<br/>procedures. Complainants may seek assistance from mediation centers or public/private<br/>interest attorneys. Civil law remedies that may be imposed by a court may include, but are not<br/>limited to, injunctions and restraining orders.</p>
<p>For complaints alleging discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying, based on State<br/>Law, a complainant must wait until 60 days have elapsed from the filing of an appeal with the<br/>CDE before pursuing civil law remedies, provided the district has appropriately and in a timely<br/>maimer apprised the complainant of his/her right to file a complaint in accordance with 5 CCR<br/>4622. The moratorium does not apply to injunctive relief and to discrimination complaints<br/>based on federal law. (Education Code 262.3</p>
