<p>GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL</p>
<p>The primary personnel relationship in the St. Helena Unified School District is between<br/>the unit member and the immediate supervisor. This procedure is not intended to<br/>supplant or replace informal consultation, personal conferences and other administrative<br/>efforts that will reduce potential areas of grievances and resolve difficulties that may<br/>arise among unit members.</p>
<p>Recognizing that it may not be possible to solve a serious problem, the parties hereby<br/>establish this procedure to provide an orderly method of resolving such problems.</p>
<p>4.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at lowest possible administrative level,<br/>equitable solutions to the problems which may, from time to time, arise affecting the<br/>welfare or working conditions of unit members and the Association. Both parties agree<br/>that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at<br/>any level of the procedure.</p>

<p>4.3.4Grievant: A unit member or group of unit members who file a grievance, the</p>
<p>Association on behalf of one or more identified unit members, or the Association</p>
<p>in its own behalf regarding grievances which concern enforcement of contract<br/>provisions not necessarily impacting individual unit members.</p>
<p>4.3.5 Conferee: A fellow unit member, a supervisor, an administrator, or an SHTA<br/>representative who, at the request of any party to a grievance, is invited to<br/>participate in a problem resolution conference or hearing or any meeting held in<br/>conjunction with the steps of the grievance procedure.</p>
<p>4.3.6Davs: Working days, on which the District Office is open for regular business,</p>

<p>4.3.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision: A decision under this article is the written response to the grievant at<br/>any level detailed in this article. To be considered a decision, this response shall<br/>include, in writing, the findings on which the decision is based.</p>

<p>4.4.3 Any unit member may at any time present a grievance(s) to his/her employer<br/>and have such grievance(s) adjusted, except as prevented by law without<br/>the intervention of the Association provided that the District shall not agree<br/>to a resolution of the grievance until the Association President has received<br/>a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given<br/>the opportunity to file a response.</p>

<p>ARTICLE VIII</p>
<p>TRANSFER AND REASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p>8.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When making all transfers and reassignments, seniority shall be a strong consideration.</p>
<p>8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers</p>
<p>8.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definition: A transfer refers to any District action which results in the assignment<br/>(movement) of a unit member from one school to another school or to another<br/>location within the District.</p>
<p>8.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfers—Voluntary</p>
<p>The Association agrees that the Superintendent is authorized, under Board policy<br/>and the Education Code, to make assignments of all unit members to vacant<br/>positions based upon the needs of the students and District. A bargaining unit<br/>member may request a voluntary transfer in writing to the Superintendent. The<br/>unit member shall express preference for work location, grade levels, or desired<br/>subject discipline areas. The Superintendent shall attempt to honor requests for<br/>voluntary transfers when the training, experience, and the abilities of the<br/>requesting unit member match the vacant position job specifications by<br/>assuring that the unit member has a scheduled interview by the &quot;Interview Team&quot;<br/>established by Board policy to fill a teaching vacancy at the particular school<br/>requested by the unit member.</p>
<p>8.1.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T ransfers—Involuntary</p>
<p>Involuntary transfers may be made based upon specific needs of the students and<br/>the District. The District shall consider the preferences, qualifications, and<br/>training of the involuntary transferee when making such assignment. However,<br/>the needs of the students and the District shall be paramount and shall take<br/>preference over the preference of the involuntary transferee. The transferee shall,<br/>upon request to the Superintendent, be given a written statement of the reason for<br/>the transfer within five (5) working days. Any unit member who is involuntarily<br/>transferred with less than ten (10) duty days’ notice shall be entitled to three (3)<br/>days paid preparation time. (“Duty day” - see Article III).</p>

<p>Board Approved: 11-14-13</p>
<p>8.1.4 The District shall provide assistance in the moving of the unit member’s materials<br/>whenever a unit member is transferred.</p>
<p>8.2 Reassignment</p>
<p>8.2.1 Definition: A reassignment is a change in assignment; i.e., in grade level or</p>
<p>subject at the same site. A reassignment is not a transfer within the meaning of<br/>this article.</p>
<p>8-2.2 Assignment: Principals should consult with unit members regarding the subjects<br/>and/or grade levels they would prefer to teach. Prior to the end of the school year,<br/>principals will, to the best of their ability, determine and communicate unit<br/>member assignments for the following year. If a change in assignment must be<br/>made, the unit member will be notified as soon as possible.</p>
<p>8.2.3 Involuntary Reassignments: Involuntary reassignments are made by admini¬<br/>strators based upon specific needs of the students and the District. The District<br/>shall consider the preferences, qualifications, training, and certifications of the<br/>person being involuntarily reassigned when making such reassignment.</p>
<p>8.2.3.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person being involuntarily reassigned shall, upon request to the<br/>Superintendent, be given a written statement of the reason for the<br/>reassignment within five (5) days.</p>
<p>8.2.3.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any unit member who is involuntarily reassigned with less than ten (10)<br/>days’ notice shall be entitled to three (3) days’ paid preparation time.<br/>(“Days” - See Article III.)</p>
<p>8.2.3.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The District shall provide assistance in the moving of the unit member’s<br/>materials whenever a unit member is reassigned.</p>

<p>The total workday and on-site requirement for part-time certificated staff shall be in<br/>proportion to such requirements for full-time unit members. Full-time special personnel<br/>(such as librarians, counselors, and coordinators) have responsibilities which require<br/>additional on-site time that will be determined by the site administrator.</p>
<p>12.2 Faculty Meetings</p>
<p>Regular faculty meetings shall be scheduled monthly as needed. It is recognized that<br/>there could be a need for a &quot;special meeting&quot; to care for a problem that must be resolved<br/>before the next regular faculty meeting. It is the responsibility of the administration and<br/>faculty to keep these meetings to a reasonable length of time, but under no circumstances<br/>shall meetings exceed one hour. With respect to regular faculty meetings, the<br/>administrator who calls such meetings shall provide unit members with an agenda for the<br/>meeting on the working day prior to the day the meeting is scheduled. Each<br/>administrator shall establish a process to permit unit members to place items on the<br/>agenda prior to its distribution. The meeting shall adhere to the agenda unless the faculty<br/>and administration mutually agree to do otherwise. Matters that could be clearly taken<br/>care of by administrative bulletin should not be placed on the agenda.</p>

<p>12.2.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formal Meetings will last no longer than one hour. Meeting discussion may<br/>continue after one hour for interested parties, however no decisions will be<br/>reached after the one hour timeline for meetings.</p>
<p>12.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assigned Periods</p>
<p>Full-time unit members in grades 6 through 12 shall have five (5) assigned teaching<br/>periods and at least one (1) teaching preparation/conference period.</p>
<p>A preparation/conference period shall be designated for K-5 unit members. This may<br/>occur either prior to the beginning, during, or at the close of the instructional day. When<br/>scheduling a necessary conference or appointment during a unit member's preparation<br/>time, the administration, in recognition of the educational value of the preparation period<br/>to the instructional program, shall endeavor to keep unit member preparation time<br/>interruption to a minimum.</p>
<p>The goal for St. Helena Primary and Elementary Schools is to provide 2.5 hours of<br/>preparation time per week.</p>
<p>12.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Required Substituting During Unit Member Preparation/Conference Period</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the principals to anticipate the need for and secure substitutes to<br/>replace unit members who will be absent due to their assignment, scheduled field trips, or<br/>a District leave that has been pre-scheduled. If, due to the unavailability of substitutes,<br/>unit members are assigned to take a class for another unit member during their<br/>preparation/conference period, the Principal shall notify the unit member during the prior<br/>working day.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged by both parties that the need for substitutes cannot always be</p>

<p>predetermined and the substitutes willing to work for short periods of time may not be<br/>available. In these circumstances, the prior working day notice would not be possible.<br/>This should be the exception. If unit members, because of an emergency not under<br/>control of the District, are assigned to take a class for another unit member during their<br/>teaching preparation and conference period, they have the choice of accruing one-fifth<br/>(1/5) of a day that could be added to sick leave or one hour of hourly pay for each hour of<br/>coverage. It shall be the administrator's responsibility to see that the opportunity for this<br/>assignment is fairly distributed.</p>
<p>12.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch and Break Periods</p>
<p>Every unit member shall be entitled to one duty-free uninterrupted lunch period and at<br/>least one duty free relief period each day. Under normal circumstances, the lunch period<br/>shall be equal in length to the students’ lunch period.</p>
<p>Unit members shall not leave the campus to conduct personal business during the<br/>preparation and conference period without the consent of the Principal.</p>
<p>12.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extended School Year</p>
<p>12.6.1 The work year shall be 188 days. There shall be 180 days of instruction in 2012-<br/>13 and 2013-14, 181 days of instruction in 2014-15, and 182 days of instruction in<br/>2015-16. The chart below further illustrates thel88 day work year:</p>

<p>through the use of unit member workdays, unit members shall work the number of<br/>additional days necessary to provide the total days of instruction referenced in<br/>section 12.6.1 in each school year without additional compensation. An<br/>individual for whom a make-up day will cause an extraordinary hardship may be<br/>eligible to apply for a day of leave under the appropriate provision of this<br/>contract.</p>
<p>12.7 Professional Duties</p>
<p>The following process shall apply to ensure the assignment of professional duties,</p>
<p>including those listed in section 12.1 above, to unit members at all school sites in the</p>
<p>District.</p>
<p>12.7.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff at each site will determine the system which would best provide for that<br/>school site for equitable distribution of the necessary tasks among the members<br/>including, for example, the formation of a Professional Duties Committee.</p>
<p>12.7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equitable distribution does not necessarily mean the same number of hours. The<br/>system will provide for an opportunity for volunteering for duties prior to any<br/>assignments being made.</p>
<p>12.7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the particular process used, the approximate time commitment for<br/>each task will be determined by each site. These will be identified prior to the<br/>first day of student attendance or as early as the tasks are known.</p>
<p>12.7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an issue arises regarding professional duties, the decision of the site<br/>administrator will be final, except that such decision will be consistent with the<br/>other provisions of this article and will be based upon the educational needs of the<br/>school.</p>

<p>CLASS SIZE</p>
<p>13.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty (30) students is considered a maximum class size at the elementary level (K-5)<br/>with an optimum class size at this level to be 25 students per classroom except in Band,<br/>Chorus, P.E., and other activity-oriented classes.</p>
<p>13.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grades 6-7-8, thirty (30) students is considered to be an optimum class size except in<br/>Band, Chorus, P.E., and other activity-oriented classes.</p>
<p>13.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these class sizes must be exceeded due to financial and/or physical circumstances,<br/>grades K-2 shall be given first consideration in trying to maintain the maximum or<br/>optimum size.</p>
<p>13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that certain classes may (in any given year) exceed the maximum stated<br/>due to the impracticability of adding an additional section of any grade for a small<br/>number of students or because larger numbers of students can be accommodated without<br/>loss of quality of education.</p>
<p>13.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the high school level no definite class size is established at this time, as maximum and<br/>optimum size are determined by the subject and activity being taught and facilities<br/>available. However, thirty (30) students is considered to be an optimum class size except<br/>in Band, Chorus, P.E., and other activity-oriented classes.</p>
<p>13.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The optimums and maximums in this article shall not be misconstrued as to preclude<br/>larger groups due to the use of new methods of instruction or staff utilization, as team<br/>teaching, large group instruction, or the use of other instructional media, e.g., television,<br/>at any grade level.</p>

<p>14.3.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horizontal movement on the salary schedule shall be effected in the school year<br/>after attaining the requirements for horizontal movement. Effective September 1,<br/>2014, unit member may not move more than one column on the salary schedule in<br/>any year, even if credits earned may allow a different column placement.</p>

<p>14.5.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-Class</p>
<p>One quarter unit of credit may be earned for ten (10) class hours of instruction<br/>and twenty (20) hours outside class for a total of thirty (30) hours. One semester<br/>unit may be earned for fifteen (15) class hours of instruction and thirty (30) hours<br/>outside class for a total of forty-five (45) hours.</p>
<p>14.5.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing Education Units (CEU)</p>

Example: One (1) CEU unit will be<br/>ten (10) hours will be divided by the semester total hours of forty-five (45). The<br/>CEU will result in 10 hours divided by 45 hours which equals .22 semester units<br/>for horizontal movement on the salary schedule.</p>
<p>14.5.2.1 For transcripts with CEUs submitted between January 1, 2013 to</p>
<p>December 31, 2013 each one (1) CEU will equal one (1) quarter unit.</p>

<p>HEALTH AND WELFARE</p>
<p>15.1 HEALTH AND WELFARE INSURANCE</p>
<p>The District contribution to health and welfare benefits, are as described below. Specific<br/>coverage and carriers are set forth in the District fact sheet.</p>
<p>15.1.1 Medical</p>
<p>The District shall contribute the full premium of the lowest cost coverage<br/>available for single, dual and family levels. Employees who choose more<br/>costly coverage shall authorize payroll deductions for the difference in<br/>premium costs.</p>
<p>If a unit member does not take any medical coverage and can provide proof of<br/>valid coverage through another carrier, the District will pay the unit member<br/>an &quot;in lieu&quot; coverage amount of $265 per month. This money will be paid<br/>directly to the unit member on the District payroll.</p>
<p>15.1.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members employed as of September 22, 2011, who have elected<br/>to receive the “cash in lieu” coverage amount of $265.00 per month<br/>will be allowed to continue receiving the “cash in lieu” coverage<br/>amount. The “cash in lieu” coverage amount will be paid directly to<br/>the Unit member on the monthly District payroll. Such Unit<br/>members will be considered “grandfathered” into the “cash in lieu”<br/>program and coverage after September 22, 2011, since the program<br/>will no longer be an option for Unit members going forward. Unit<br/>members grandfathered into the “cash in lieu” coverage amount must<br/>continue to provide annual proof of valid medical coverage through<br/>another carrier.</p>
<p>15.1.1.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After September 22, 2011, all Unit members and future Unit</p>

<p>15.1.6</p>
<p>members will no longer have the choice to elect the “cash in lieu”<br/>coverage amount because the program will be discontinued as a<br/>coverage option. After September 22, 2011, if a Unit member who has<br/>been grandfathered into the “cash in lieu” program elects to<br/>discontinue their “cash in lieu” coverage and instead elects to join one<br/>of the District’s medical insurance coverage plans, the Unit member<br/>forfeits their grandfathered status and does not have the option to re¬<br/>elect their “cash in lieu” coverage.</p>
<p>Dental. Vision and Life</p>
<p>The District shall contribute the full premium of the lowest cost single<br/>coverage available to be provided for all SHTA members.</p>
<p>Unit members who have been granted an unpaid leave of absence by the<br/>Board shall continue to have the option to maintain their District-paid<br/>insurance plan for the leave period granted at the unit member’s expense.<br/>Arrangements for their personal premium payments to the District for this<br/>continued coverage must be made through the District Office.</p>
<p>Unit members who have been granted a leave of absence by the Board for<br/>extended disability due to health reasons shall have their District-paid health<br/>insurance plan coverage maintained at District expense, per item 15.1.1 and<br/>15.1.2 above, during the term of the leave.</p>
<p>Full-time unit members who are granted a partial leave or reduction of<br/>assignment shall receive prorated benefits, i.e., a full-time unit member whose<br/>assignment is reduced to 80% shall receive 80% of a full-time unit member's<br/>fringe benefit package contribution.</p>
<p>Unit members granted shared contracts for one full-time position will be<br/>allowed to divide one full-time benefit package, in a manner acceptable to the<br/>insurers.</p>

<p>f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been at least six months since either of the two partied<br/>has filed a statement of termination of a previous domestic<br/>partnership an affidavit with the District.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two parties agree to notify the District Business Office if<br/>there is a change in the circumstances attested to in the<br/>affidavit or if the domestic partnership is terminated.</p>
<p>15.2.1.3 Termination: A domestic partnership shall terminate when any of</p>
<p>the following occurs:</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic partners no longer have a common residence. A<br/>temporary separation resulting from work, education, or<br/>health related requirements shall not constitute the cessation<br/>of common residence.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon termination of the partnership, the unit members</p>
<p>shall notify the District by filing a Statement of Termination<br/>of Domestic Partnership (see Appendix D). The form shall<br/>include a statement whereby the unit member shall certify<br/>under penalty of peijury that he or she notified his or her<br/>domestic partner of the termination of the partnership.

<p>of the month following the receipt of the Statement of<br/>Termination of Domestic Partnership.</p>
<p>f. The Statement of Termination must be filed within thirty (30)<br/>days of the end of the domestic partnership. If the District<br/>suffers any loss as a result of the unit member’s failure to file<br/>the statement, the unit member shall be liable to the District<br/>for actual loss engendered by the failure to receive notice that<br/>the domestic partnership has been terminated.</p>
<p>15.2.1.4 Application and Terms: In order to receive any benefit<br/>provided for by this Section, a unit member and his or her<br/>domestic partner shall complete, have notarized, and file with<br/>the District a St. Helena Unified School District Affidavit of<br/>Domestic Partnership (see Appendix D).</p>

A written response from the immediate<br/>supervisor shall be sent to all involved parties within 5 working days of the<br/>meeting.</p>
